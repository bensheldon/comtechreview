<p><img src="/winter-spring-2004/img/banner3.jpg" alt="CMT program logo"></p>
<p>The University of Massachusetts <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/">Community
Media and Technology
Program</a> has just received final approval to begin offering a
liberal arts degree [Bachelor of Arts]. As part of the <a
href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/">College of Public and Community
Service [CPCS]</a> at UMass/Boston, the CMT Program is founded on a
vision of activist education and learning in pursuit of social justice.
Like the community media and technology movements the program takes
from and informs, the CMT educational approach is grounded in the
strong democratic philosophies of people like Paulo Freire, John Dewy,
and Antonio Gramsci.
<p>
<div class="sidebar_right">
<p><b>The CMT Certificate</b> <br>
<br>
The Certificate in Community Media and Technology is a six competency
sequence that can be completed over the course of one calendar year—or
at a more leisurely pace . In either case, the sequence consists of: <b></center>
<ul>
<li>Media Literacy</li>
<li>Community Action</li>
<li>Analyzing Media</li>
<li>Media and Community Building</li>
<li>Using Technology</li>
<li>Developing A Media Strategy</li>
</ul>
</b></p>
</div></p>
<p>The core of the academic program is a self-paced, competency-based,
outcomes-oriented curriculum in which prior learning is validated and
collaborative socially and politically active projects are developed
through partnerships with activists, community media and tech
organizations, non-profits, unions and others. Because our curriculum
is competency based we can award academic credit for prior learning and
independent, project-based leaning initiatives taking place in
community organizations. We are also able to deliver a free-standing
certificate in community media, on-line, through a web-based
curriculum. The six course/competency certificate program is focused in
the advanced areas of the curriculum and is designed for those who
already have a BA and want to certify or gain specialized competency or
those who simply want an abbreviated concentrated academic experience.
</p>
<p>The program is thus positioned to play a unique role in identifying
best practices and broaden the dialogue in community media and
technology practices as well as provide valuable research, professional
development, and training.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b>The Curriculum</b>
</p>
<p>The CMT developmental curriculum has a career focus and is built on
four Levels. To complete the baccalaureate degree, a student must earn
120 credits. Of these, 81 credits are in the <b>Core Knowledge and
Skills</b> basic level application to all CPCS students and includes
competencies in <b>Media Literacy, Exploring Culture, Exploring
Community, </b> and <b>Public and Community Action. </b> Of the
remaining courses/competencies, students are also required to complete <b>"Communication
and Computer Portfolio"</b> and work in the CMT Major which begins at
Level II. Work culminates in a Level IV <b>"Capstone Project,"</b>
designed as an exit level project in which students synthesize their
educational experiences. As with other majors in the new CPCS
curriculum, CMT students have the option of combining their major with
a related concentration in an area such as <b>Management, Organizing, </b>or<b>
Training and Development.</b> Advanced levels are as follows:
</p>
<p><b>Level II</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>History of Mass Communication —</b> Students will be able to
discuss the invention and development of the major mass communication
technologies—print, sound recording, radio, television, film, and
computer-assisted communication—and describe their corporate structure
and ownership patterns with a special emphasis on how they affect
content and cultural development. </li>
<li><b>Converging Technologies</b> —Affordable digital recording
equipment, non-linear editing, photo editing and presentation software,
the Internet, and Broadband are creating a new digital environment for
community-based organizations and activists. Students will demonstrate
an integrated understanding of the converging digital media
environment, using information technology and computer-assisted
communication as one interacting system. </li>
<li><b>Analyzing Media</b> — Students will demonstrate a systematic
knowledge of the operations of selected communication media, be able to
provide close readings of texts, and critically analyze such variables
as image selection, framing, lighting, camera angles, newsworthiness,
reliance on experts, and use of statistics, as these affect perceptions
of social issues, public policies, and cultural groups. </li>
<li><b>Media and Community Building</b> — Students will be able to
compare and contrast a range of existing models and best practices in
the use of communication media and information technologies as tools
for education and community organizing, and discuss the application of
such uses to local projects and/or organizations. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Level III</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Writing for Media</b> — Students will demonstrate the ability
to write leaflets, press releases, letters to the editor, news stories,
instruction manuals, story boards, proposals, curriculum packages, and
other documents related to public and community issues and groups. </li>
<li><b>Using Technology</b> — Students will choose two of these
technically-oriented competencies, demonstrate technical proficiency in
a particular communications medium or information technology, and apply
these skills to a project related to public and community service.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Using Technology — Video and Audio Production </li>
<li>Using Technology — Multimedia Authoring </li>
<li>Using Technology — Computer Networking (to be developed in
year 2) </li>
<li>Using Technology — Database Management (also in year 2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Media/Technology Policy</b> — Students will analyze and
discuss the relevant legislation, regulatory guidelines, and rules of
access regarding the mass media and communication technologies with a
particular emphasis on community responsibility, public and community
access, and the development of community-based alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Level IV</b>
</p><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Developing a Media/Technology Strategy</b> — Students will
identify and research a relevant public or community issue,
organizational need, or social goal, describe its fit with larger
organizing goals and strategies, and design an effective
media/technology project to build capacity, mobilize a constituency,
and or influence key stakeholders in the area selected. </li>
<li><b>Implementing a Media/Technology Strategy</b> — For the
particular community issue, organizational need, or social goal chosen
above, students will implement an effective media/technology project
and reflect on the effectiveness of the effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi Fred,</p>

<p>Rob Williams, ACME Board President and Champlain College professor of history/media here.</p>

<p>I am intrigued with your remarkable BA offerings here. We are exploring similar kinds of programs at CC - I'd love to get more information from you about the nature of your program.</p>

<p>Any wisdom you have is most welcome...</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
