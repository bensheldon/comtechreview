<h3 class="title">Building Community Technology Capacity Through Service Learning</h3>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><H2>Community Technology Capacity In Houston</H2><TABLE align=left border=1 cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0><TBODY><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=181><P><img src="/spring-2003/Reedpc140035.jpg"></P></TD></TR><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=181><P>A seminar with CTC leaders introducing them to the TFA/UH College of Technology parnternship. CTCs represented include: Shape Community Center, Spring Branch Family Development Center, Boyton Chapel United Methodist Church, Tejano Learning Center and the LULAC National Education Service Center (Houston Office)</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Since 1997, <A href="http://houston.techforall.org/">Technology For All-Houston</A> (TFA-Houston) has helped create, develop and support over <A href="http://houston.techforall.org/submenus/ctcs.html">170 community technology centers</A> (CTCs) in collaboration with grass-roots community based organizations across the greater Houston area. These CTCs and their organizations serve a vital need in their underserved communities. Their greatest assets are the passion with which they serve their communities and the community credibility they have with their constituents because it. However, in many cases these CTCs have limited funding, small staffs and limited technical capacity. Thus, they are limited in their effectiveness.</P><P>As the nonprofit serving the Houston area to support and encourage local grass roots community technology efforts, TFA-Houston provides best practice seminars, consulting services, sharing of resources (hardware and software), and encouragement activities for community technology practitioners. In past years, when more funding was available, TFA-Houston also provided technical support to many CTCs at no cost to the CTCs. Providing this service was cost and labor intensive for TFA-Houston. In addition, this service had limited impact on the larger CTC community of Houston because the small staff (two full-time and four part-time employees) could only serve a small percentage of the CTCs. We have also learned, upon further evaluation, that the original model of free technical services built CTC dependency rather than CTC capacity.</P><P>The revised model, which now includes limited fees for services and shared "sweat equity" also includes a unique <A href="http://www./">service learning approach</A> developed in collaboration with the University Houston that builds technology capacity in CTCs through collaborative student projects. <A href="http://houston.techforall.org/submenus/resources.html">These projects are documented and shared among other CTCs across the community</A>. The benefits of this program have been huge to Houston CTCs. In addition to building technology capacity, this approach has created a unique forum for collaboration and dialogue among CTCs as students and CTCs meet together to create solutions to challenges that face multiple CTCs across the city.</P><H3>A Service Learning Approach</H3><P>Introducing Community Service Learning as a teaching method allowed the <A href="http://www.tech.uh.edu/">University of Houston (UH) College of Technology</A> to promote student learning through active participation in meaningful and planned student project teams developing a variety of technology solutions to build technology capacity in the Houston area CTCs. Examples of the student team projects included developing Technology Infrastructure Plans for new or existing CTCs; designing and building volunteer or student databases to track existing and future program offerings; and designing and piloting mentoring and training programs for Technology Learning Coaches.</P><P>An important aspect of this learning experience for these <A href="http://www.tech.uh.edu/itec/ist">Information Systems Technology</A> (IST) students is the opportunity to take the knowledge and skills they are learning in the classroom in project management, team leadership, and communication, and problem-solving, and apply these skills in a real technology project team experiences, working with a local CTC. Through reflective activities, students enhance their understanding of course content, general knowledge, sense of civic responsibility, self-awareness and commitment to the community.</P><P>Another aspect of the <A href="http://www.uh.edu/academics/catalog/tec/octe_courses.html#OCTE2338">Capacity-building Community Technology Outreach Program</A> (CCTOP) is that it meets actual needs of the Houston area CTCs and is integrated into the student's curriculum as a required course for all Information Systems Technology students. The purpose behind designing this course in this manner was to provide a structured learning opportunity for IST students to reflect on their learnings and communicate their thoughts (through the use of Learning Journals) about the service they are engaged in. One specific learning outcome of the course is that the student will develop a sense of caring for others and give back to the community. Other critical skills that are developed throughout the course are enhanced problem solving, how to work effectively in project teams, and engagement skills.</P><P>In our second semester offering this required course in the College of Technology, we have found that students are excited and surprised by the value and expertise they are able to bring to the local CTCs. Many of the students had no awareness of the digital divide, or how they could help close that gap in their own community&#8212;using skills they were learning in the BS Degree in Information Systems Technology. We are currently identifying other Information Technology courses that service learning methodology can be successfully integrated into in the future.</P><H3>Suggestions For Replication</H3><P>This collaborative capacity building effort has just begun. Even so, there are already several important lessons learned. To build community technology capacity in your community using a service learning approach, the following suggestions are offered:</P><DIV></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>Choose projects that can be easily scaled and replicated with other CTCs</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Clearly define project deliverables and timelines</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Assign key persons within each institution to manage the project relationships</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Engage CTCs in the evaluation of student project teams</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Recognize and plan for capacity building that occurs with individual CTCs and with other CTCs in the community as projects are documented and shared</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Provide opportunities for students to interact directly with the CTC and its constituents/clients</DIV><LI>Create &#8220;"celebration" events to recognize students and CTCs </LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>For more information contact <A href="mailto:will.reed@techforall.org">will.reed@techforall.org</A> or call 713-961-0012.</P><HR align=center SIZE=2 width="100%"><P>Karla M.

<h3 class="title">KY Consortium Brings Better Access to Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing</h3>

<TABLE width=75 align=left border=1><TBODY><TR><TD><IMG height=113 src="/spring-2003/davis.jpg" width=250></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>The deaf/hard-of-hearing community in Kentucky totals approximately 400,000 people. In order to provide members of this community with equitable access to remote interpreting, a statewide network, the Kentucky Deaf Access Consortium (K-DAC), was created. K-DAC consists of four partners: <A href="http://www.interpreting.eku.edu/center_on_deafness.html">Eastern Kentucky University's Center on Deafness</A>, the <A href="http://kydvr.state.ky.us/">Kentucky Department of Vocational Rehabilitation</A>, the <A href="http://www.state.ky.us/agencies/kcdhh/home/index.html">Kentucky Commission on the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing</A>, and the <A href="http://dmhmrs.chr.state.ky.us/">Kentucky Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation</A>. For more than ten years, the partners have collaborated on other projects, and the Consortium was a natural outgrowth of these efforts.</P><P>Federal funding for the Consortium makes access to remote interpreting and captioning possible. Via a Deaf Access Station (DAS), which is a computer workstation equipped with a camera, a deaf consumer needing services from a hearing service provider that&nbsp;does not communicate in sign language, can be linked to an interpreter in another location. With the DAS, the interpreter can use any computer that has the necessary videoconferencing software and connect with the individuals in the other location, who also have the same software. The deaf consumer can begin to ask questions while the interpreter voices for the hearing service provider. When the service provider answers, the deaf consumer watches the interpreter on the screen as the interpreter signs the translation.</P><P>The software chosen for the project is Sorensen's <A href="http://www.sorenson.com/">EnVision</A>. This product removes the delayed motion previously encountered when attempting to communicate in American Sign Language using other teleconferencing packages. Before applying for funding, the partners conducted a year-long usage feasibility of EnVision, testing its functionality and practicality over a variety of lines. In spring 2001, the first DAS using the EnVision product was deployed at the Kentucky Commission on the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing. A statewide deployment was held at Kentucky's <A href="http://www.state.ky.us/agencies/kcdhh/deafestival/main.html">DeaFestival</A>, June 2002. </P><P>Using the information gathered from the usage feasibility study and from task force data collected in 1996, the University, along with its partners, applied for federal funding for the DAS project. Application was made to the Department of Commerce's <A href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/">Technology Opportunities Program</A> (TOP) in spring 2001, and funding was approved in fall 2002. Since that time, the partners have developed an installation plan that allows 40 public stations to be established throughout the state by the end of the project in fall 2004. Given that the EnVision product has dropped in price from $500 to $150 in the past year, the Consortium's hope is that deaf consumers will eventually have this software loaded on their personal home computers.</P><P>This access eliminates the waiting time for services, decreases the need for intervention, and reduces access hardships for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. TOP believes that K-DAC will also serve as a national model of successful and replicable service provider delivery to deaf and hard-of-hearing consumers. The external evaluator will conduct the first user evaluation of the project this fall. </P><DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2></DIV><P>Tricia Davis (<A href="mailto:Tricia.Davis@eku.edu">Tricia.Davis@eku.edu</A>) is Grants and Projects Director at the Center on Deafness at Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond, Kentucky, and is serving as Project Director for the K-DAC project.

<h3 class="title">Project Fix-Net: Affordable, Dependable Technical Assistance</h3>

<P><A href="http://www.austinfree.net/">Austin Free-Net</A>, a non-profit organization supporting over 40 community technology centers in Austin, Texas, has launched a fee-based technology assistance service called "<A href="http://www.austinfree.net/fix-net/fix-net.html">Fix-Net</A>." The following outlines some of the steps, rationale, and lessons from the development of this project, in the hopes of inspiring and encouraging other CTCs as they develop projects designed to generate revenue while providing a key service to other non-profit and public agencies.</P><P>In 2000, the Board of Directors of Austin Free-Net drafted an ambitious Strategic Plan calling for expansion of sites and services coupled with a diversification of the funding base to sustain the programs.&nbsp; Central to this plan was the development of a "revenue-generating activity for long-term sustainability."</P><P>As we pondered what this fee-based service might be, PolicyLink published an article by Josh Kirschenbaum and Radika Kumamneni (Fall 2001) called&nbsp;"<A href="http://www.ncrp.org/Report_3pgs.pdf">Beyond Access: A Foundation Guide to Ending the Organizational Divide</A>." The authors indicate that "more than 70 percent of organizations surveyed had an important or critically important need for additional information technology resources." They conclude that a current priority is "helping nonprofits fully integrate IT tools into their ongoing operations."</P><P>We began to explore the idea further, and found the need for affordable, dependable technical assistance to be strong in central Texas. Without any extensive advertising or formal program in place, from January to May 2002, 37 potential Fix-Net customers contacted us seeking:</P><DIV></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>Support in making better use of information technology in their offices and programs;</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Consultation on the issues inherent to meeting the public's needs for technology and training; and</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>A spectrum of services including setting up technology centers and programs, ongoing technical support, volunteer recruitment, training for staff and volunteers, web hosting and maintenance, and presentations about our services or issues of equitable access. </DIV></LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>Thanks to becoming sponsors of an Americorps*VISTA project, new grants partnerships and contracts supporting our work, we hired much-needed staff after developing our current Strategic Plan. Successful implementation hinged on quickly coalescing as a team and, most importantly, embracing the "inherited" plan. In a pivotal, facilitated staff meeting, we assessed our individual and organizational skills and experience built on our seven-year history including visionary founders, the City of Austin's commitment to public access, a highly-skilled staff experienced installing, networking, and maintaining over 40 public computer sites, designing and running training programs, recruiting and training volunteers, a great web site, and helping other organizations with tech planning and grant writing.</P><P>As an experienced community technology provider, we were acutely aware of the challenges of organizations working to better integrate technology even as they provide state-of-art community tech programs and other vital services. We agreed that were uniquely positioned to provide an affordable, dependable, and essential service to assist other agencies to better serve the public in their own vital ways. Our plan would not only generate a steady revenue stream to sustain our own public access programs, but we would be providing a crucial service to the non-profit and public sectors.</P><P>We had conversations potential customers to access their needs, and we researched other technology assistance providers. We prepared a preliminary Austin market analysis using <A href="http://www.guidestar.org/">Guidestar's database</A>. Other early strategies included extensive online research, workshops on relevant issues, discussions with <A href="http://www.compumentor.org/">CompuMentor</A>, a visit to <A href="http://www.npower.org/">NPower</A>, participation in <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet</A>, <A href="http://www.afcn.org/">AFCN</A>, and similar mailing lists which have been priceless. National discussions and local response to our idea confirm daily that we are part of a national trend among community technology providers leveraging their technical expertise to provide technical assistance to non-profits while ensuring the sustainability of their own programs. And, within our own archives, we found documents showing that our founders had indeed anticipated that, while public access and training would remain central to our mission, our work could eventually include providing technical assistance to other nonprofits. We drafted preliminary goals, objectives, and a timeline for implementation.&nbsp; </P><P>As we designed the pilot, we assessed our organizational capacity to determine the initial scope of Fix-Net. Staff immediately sought pro bono professional advice on legal issues, business models, pricing, billing, and publicity. Our billing and tracking systems have been tested and are ready for full-scale operation. A lawyer on our board has helped staff to create legal contracts. Examples of professional support include <A href="http://www.texascbar.org/">Texas C-Bar</A>, a local non-profit that dispenses free legal advice to non-profits and <A href="http://www.nion-is.com/">NION Interactive</A>, a multimedia production company working with AFN staff and a University of Texas student to develop publicity materials. </P><P>A key issue we pay close attention to is how the IRS would view our new revenue source.&nbsp; With legal advice we have carefully designed Fix-Net so that it will not jeopardize our nonprofit status. This means: </P></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>We offer the service only to non-profit and public agencies;</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>A sliding scale exists so that no organization will be turned away due to inability to pay;</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>We will not abuse our nonprofit status to undercut for-profit providers; and</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>The service is related to our mission. </DIV></LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>In just half a year, Fix-Net brought in $15,000 from 15 clients, including contracts with United Way to provide tech training and equipment installation to nonprofit child-care providers, with the Housing Authority of the City of Austin to implement labs and volunteer training in two public housing projects, with Parks and Recreation to conduct seniors' computer training classes, and a fee for services to the Green Builders' Conference. </P><P>Emboldened by the success of the pilot program, we are now taking steps to formalize and expand the project. A University intern and a local PR firm are volunteering to assist in designing logo and PR materials and a marketing plan. A team of business students will help conduct focus groups (also based on NPower's online documents) and market research, and assist us in completing the design of a viable business plan based on our experiences to date and focus group feedback. </P><P>An unforeseen windfall of Fix-Net has been the impetus to gain new technical skills to better serve our clients. For example, two groups hired us to install wireless networks into their facilities&#8212;a new arena for our technical staff.&nbsp; We have also increased our knowledge of Linux systems, enabling us to offer open source services as requested as well as in our own centers.</P><P>What does the future hold?&nbsp; With the upcoming full launch of Fix-Net, we expect that demand will eventually (soon?) outpace our staff capacity. We continue to identify pro bono resources but the Fix-Net budget includes anticipated paid professional services. We expect to use Fix-Net revenues and other funding to hire a Business Manager and contract qualified technicians and trainers.&nbsp; Grants are being written to cover the subsidized offerings to low-budget organizations.&nbsp; New services will be rolled out as the increased revenue allows for additional staff and expansion of Fix-Net's services. And periodic program evaluation is planned to fine-tune the program.</P><P>But just like Fix-Net's initial development, its expansion will be carefully planned and monitored.&nbsp; Is the project enabling us to better accomplish our core mission, rather than distracting us from it?&nbsp; Is the work of the project itself meaningful and related to our mission?&nbsp; As long as we can continue to answer "yes" to both questions, Austin Free-Net will continue to be a strong, growing organization through this fee-based service.</P><HR align=center SIZE=2 width="100%"></DIV><P>Rick Juliusson (<A href="mailto:rick@austinfree.net">rick@austinfree.net</A>) is the director of strategic partnerships for Austin Free-Net.

<h3 class="title">E-Government: Strategies for Community Technology Practitioners</h3>

<P><BR>When President Bush signed the E-Government Act of 2002 last December, he spotlighted an important and growing opportunity for community technology practitioners&#151;the move toward putting public information, government services, and civic engagement programs online.</P><P>The act includes certain provisions that are especially relevant to community-based technology. For example, it calls for the creation of a federal Internet portal; an evaluation of best practices in community technology programs; the identification of ways to expand the use of best practices among community technology centers; and an online tutorial to teach individuals how to access government information and services on the Internet. The administration also plans to promote community technology programs as places where individuals can access online government resources.</P><P>While Congress appropriated less than the $45 million included in the E-Government Act, its decision to include $5 million for this fiscal year is a significant step toward putting government services and resources online.</P><DIV></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>In November 2002, U.S. government Web sites attracted more visitors than either Google or Amazon (Nielsen//NetRatings, <I><A href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/pr/pr_021121.pdf">Top 10 Web Sites by Parent Company and Top 10 Web Sites by Brand, Month of October 2002</A></I>, November 2002).</DIV><LI>According to the 2002 Digital State Survey, conducted by the Center for Digital Government, more than 80% of states responding to the survey have begun transferring social-service benefits electronically, and many residents now contact social-service caseworkers via e-mail (Government Technology, <I><A href="http://www.govtech.net/magazine/story.phtml?id=29356">Final Results for the 2002 Digital State Survey &#151;Story: Digital Dogfight</A></I>, November 2002). <LI>Findings like these recently led the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project to conclude: "Web presence is not optional for governments in the United States&#151;Government budget-writers require that the cost-savings potential of the Internet be mastered. At the same time, laws and executive orders mandate the provision of at least some services online" (Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, <I><A href="http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=57">The Rise of the E-Citizen: How People Use Government Agencies&#151;Web Sites</A></I>, April 3, 2002). </LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>In addition, some community-based technology programs are starting to develop e-government initiatives as avenues to simplify residents' use of government programs, to promote program sustainability, and to conduct advocacy. There have also been some promising efforts around civic engagement, helping residents register to vote online and tap the Web for vital citizen information.</P><P>While there is exciting potential for e-government to raise the quality of life in low-income neighborhoods, there are also risks in the move to do the business of government online. The relocation of information and services onto the Internet could further marginalize those without online access&#151;or without the skills needed to use these online resources. Moreover, it is important to press the government to develop its content in ways that are needed and desired in underserved communities.</P><P>We at The Children's Partnership recognize that there is much at stake for low-income communities and for the community technology movement. We see this as an important moment to explore, analyze, and report on smart approaches to e-government for community technology. The Children's Partnership is working on three strategies that may be useful to you.</P><H3>E-Government Services for Community Residents</H3><P>The Children's Partnership, working with a consortium of community technology practitioners in California called the <A href="http://www.cctpg.org/">California Community Technology Policy Group</A> (CCTPG), has researched and participated in efforts to connect e-government directly to community residents through technology programs.</P><P>One good example is the effort of eight community technology programs throughout California who used the November 2002 elections to help residents register to vote and learn about candidates and ballot measures via the Internet.&nbsp; We worked with many partners, including: the Cyber Y Technology Center at the YMCA Youth and Family Services in San Diego to develop a simple election curriculum (called <A href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/e-lection.html">e-Lection</A>), which technology programs interested in this form of e-government can use; the California Community Technology Policy Group for guidance on real world applicability and to help promote the initiative; and the Community Digital Initiative in Riverside to beta test the effort.</P><P>Every month, it seems, new opportunities emerge to use e-government to assist low-income clients. Community technology programs can coach participants in ways to use the Internet when, for example, they want to renew a driver's license, apply for enrollment in a public health insurance program, file for state disability or unemployment insurance, or renew a professional license. They can also help community users navigate the child support system, find affordable housing, or support for the elderly. The list continues to grow.</P><H3>Tapping E-Government To Build and Sustain Community Technology Programs</H3><P>Although the potential benefits of e-government are enormous, many in low-income communities are unaware of them or unaware of how to use them. Community technology programs can provide the coaching and technical assistance to residents at neighborhood centers as they attempt to use e-government services to meet their everyday needs.</P><P>The Children's Partnership, as part of its work with <A href="http://www.cctpg.org/">CCTPG</A>, is helping develop a California statewide demonstration in which a handful of community technology programs would use their existing infrastructure to serve as E-Government Access &amp; Efficiency Centers. Each program would have a trained E-Government Assistance staff person to show residents what they can accomplish online and answer their questions. Each would maintain a Web portal to centralize e-government services and track client use. If successfully launched, this pilot holds the potential to demonstrate the vital role community technology programs can play in extending the reach of e-government into underserved communities and in making the business of government more efficient</P><H3>Ensuring That Government Information Meets the Needs of Low-Income and Other Underserved Communities</H3><P>Ensuring that low-income communities benefit from e-government services will also require vigilance to ensure that the government information is presented in ways that address the needs of underserved communities.&nbsp; The Children's Partnership published a <A href="http://contentbank.org/TCP-OnlineContent.pdf">comprehensive analysis</A> of what content is most needed by low-income communities and updated the research in 2002.</P><P><B>Findings include</B>: </P><P><B>Low-Income Americans Online</B>: Twice as many low-income Americans now use the Internet as did two years ago&#151;16.7 million, up from 7.8 million.&nbsp; They are most interested in online resources that help them find employment, affordable housing, and deal with life's daily challenges.</P><P><B>Non-English Speakers</B>: Today, an estimated 45 million Americans do not speak English at home, versus 32 million in 2000.&nbsp; Many want information in languages other than English.</P><P><B>Those with Disabilities</B>: An estimated 8.5% of Americans have at least one disability that requires special features on computers and the Internet to make these resources are accessible.</P><P><B>What Underserved Americans Want Online</B>: Practical information focusing on local community; information at a basic literacy level; material in multiple languages; spaces for ethnic and cultural interests; interfaces and content accessible to people with disabilities; easier searching; and coaches to guide them.</P><P>As more government information and services migrate online, we must work together to make sure the content is developed and presented to be most effective for our communities.</P><P>TCP will continue to meet with policy-makers to brief them on this important issue and has made <A href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/youngamericans/statefacts.html">briefing materials</A> available for community technology practitioners who would like to bring the importance of technology and useful content for underserved communities to the attention of their elected officials.</P><H2>Contentbank.org Online Exchange: Technology Tools Connecting Citizens to Government</H2><P>In June of 2002 The Children's Partnership (TCP) launched Contentbank.org, a Web site designed to spur the development of needed Internet content for low-income and underserved communities. </P><P>Contentbank.org has three major goals:</P><P>1. To identify what online content low-income users need, examples of what exists, and what still needs to be created; </P><P>2. To make it easier for community-based organizations and the individuals they serve to create their own content; and </P><P>3. To encourage the public and private sectors to develop useable content for low-income and underserved Americans.</P><P>One popular feature on Contentbank.org is our message board area, called the Online Exchange. We host periodic Exchanges focused on specific topics that our users have told us are important to them. The Online Exchange is designed to give our users the opportunity to exchange resources, ideas, curricula, and more.</P><P>The most recent Contentbank.org Online Exchange focused on how e-government initiatives are affecting the lives of underserved people. The Exchange also examined the role community-based organizations play in bringing e-government services to those individuals. The participants shared several local, national, and international resources and guidelines that community-based organizations can use as they develop e-government programs of their own.</P><P>Online Exchange participants presented their innovative e-government projects that included setting up "e-gov" centers where local residents use computer terminals to access online government services, register to vote, and connect to the democratic process. &nbsp;Local e-government programs include <A href="http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/gov/dit/publicaccess.htm">Fairfax County, VA</A>, the <A href="http://www.cctpg.org/">California Community Technology Policy Group</A>, and the <A href="http://www.seattle.gov/">City of Seattle</A>. On a national level, <A href="http://www.irs.gov/">free online tax filing</A> was reported as one of this year's biggest success stories. Participants also posted links to new services, e-government portals, e-government accessibility guidelines, and related research from Pew Internet and American Life Project.</P><P>Below are a few of the best resources from the exchange:</P><P><A href="http://www.govbenefits.gov/">GovBenefits</A>&#151;The Labor Department launched this site in April 2002.

<h3 class="title">Nonprofits Get Paid by UK Government to Support Technology Centers</h3>

<TABLE><TBODY>
<TR>
<TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=110>
<img src="/spring-2003/img/ruralnet.jpg">
</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>David Wilcox, my colleague in <A href="http://www.makingthenetwork.org/">Making the Net Work</A>, is based in London and has been a prime mover for community networking and CTCs in the United Kingdom since the mid-90s. Whenever I visit the UK scene, I am awed by (1) the scale of government resources available to CTCs and other community tech initiatives (in contrast to the US); (2) the cohesive national policy that provides a sense of identity, ongoing technical assistance, and frequent networking opportunities for these initiatives; (3) the concern for the social context in which community tech projects function; and (4) the understanding of the need for continuity of service delivery -- from community outreach through formal IT training certifications.  </P>
<P>In particular, the <A href="http://www.directsupport.org.uk/">DirectSupport</A> collaborative that David describes below is an excellent model that insures consistent face-to-face support and consultation for many community-based CTCs in the UK.  This cost-effective initiative (akin to a combination of CTCNet, America Connects Consortium, and the Circuit Rider movement) is funded, though not managed, by the national government. In the US, I see a patchwork of local, regional, and national efforts, all funded year-to-year on soft money.  In the UK, DirectSupport insures that assistance is deployed "just-in-time" and equitably to small as well as large communities, rural as well as urban. I often think how wonderful it would be to have the DirectSupport model here in the US. But, I'll let David tell the story...</P>

<H3>David Wilcox writes:</H3>
<P>UK nonprofits that pioneered online working among their members have formed a consortium to help community-based organizations set up technology centers. <A href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/ukonlinecentres/">UK Online Centers</A> <A name=_Hlt23051563></A>has a government-supported web site.  Their comprehensive support model—under which community workers in the organizations are paid to be mentors—could be deployed more widely.</P>
<P>In the UK, the Government is committed to establishing 6,000 centers in England by the end of 2002 by funding new facilities in libraries, colleges and community centers, and branding existing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) centers. The aim is to enable anyone who wants it to have Internet access near their home and an opportunity to develop new skills.</P>
<P>Center set-up costs have been funded from the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) Capital Modernization Fund, and initial revenue has been provided by the National Lottery.  Many centers are able to access ongoing revenue for learning activities from the National Learning and Skills Council, but funding for informal open access is still not resolved. Budgets over three years are about $450 million US for equipment and running costs. </P>
<P>In addition to capital and revenue funding for start-ups, the DfES is supporting two programs to provide center managers and partners with help in technology, management,, and activities and projects for center uses.</P>
<P>A community programs team at the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency runs the larger of these programs.  The <A href="http://www.communityprogrammes.org.uk/">BECTA team</A> is funded by the Government and others to support schools colleges and community educators.</P>
<TABLE align=right border=1 cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=152>
<img src="/spring-2003/img/vrds1.jpg"></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>The team runs a"<A href="http://centres.ngfl.gov.uk/">Help is at Hand</A>" website, email newsletter and list, organizes events for centers and supports content development. They are able to give technical advice and call on the expertise of other colleagues in the organization who work with education establishments.</P>
<P>Alastair Clark, BECTA team member, says: "Centers have been set-up in a wide variety of host organizations and it is the diversity of this 'community' that leads to a great diversity of needs. Good communication between centers is key to developing a co-operative self-help culture within the network. BECTA has played an important role in developing the sense of common identity within the UK online centers network through our program of events, web site and online discussion group."</P>
<P>In addition to this agency support, the Government recognized that centers set up by community-based organizations would need more support than those in, for example, libraries or colleges, and DfES awarded a contract to a consortium of nonprofit organizations, called <A name=_Hlt23051662></A><A href="http://www.directsupport.org.uk/">DirectSupport</A>.</P>
<P>The consortium provides centers with a comprehensive service that includes a telephone help line, a dedicated extranet including both forums and a substantial knowledge base, events, and a "circuit rider-style" mentor service. Mentors can advise on everything from start up to tech requirements, business planning and center activities. DirectSupport is developing fun "<A href="http://www.directsupport.org.uk/curiosit.htm">CuriosIT</A>" activities designed to appeal to a wide range of users not necessarily wishing to start formal training.</P>
<P>DirectSupport was able to create its service because it is run by five of the eighteen partner organizations already using a common technology platform run by <A href="http://www.networksonline.org.uk/">NetworksOnline</A>. This is a "network of networks" providing services for a range of nonprofit organizations and some 2000 subscribers.</P>
<P>The mentoring program has been particularly successful because DirectSupport was able to recruit mentors from subscribers to the system, and then pay for their work under the DfES contract. DirectSupport is in touch with some 300 centers, and has about twenty mentors active at any one time out of a total of sixty. Centers can call on mentors for at least four days support and sometimes more.</P>
<P>Jane Berry, who manages the DirectSupport program, says: "These are existing grassroots community workers. We had a team within days of launching DirectSupport, and others have been able to join as the program has developed. The online systems were already loaded with relevant content and services, and the workers at the outset were already members, so familiar with how to use the systems.</P>
<P>"This model has the most exciting potential we have discovered. It gives small voluntary sector agencies the platform for joint working, fosters relationship building and trust, and gives people a real reason to use and develop their technology skills as well."</P>
<P>The UK Government is currently reviewing how best to help community-based organizations and other nonprofits make more extensive use of information and communication technologies in their work. Networks Online is discussing with Government departments how it might extend the DirectSupport model from centers to a wider program of support.</P>

In a recent "<A href="http://www.makingthenetwork.org/docs/journal.htm">Review of Civic and Community Use of Technology in the UK</A>," I wrote: "Civic and community use of the Internet is important to the UK Government because of its targets for moving services online, and to commerce because of the insights it provides into user styles and preferences. It is also crucial in the development and re-energizing of our social and civic institutions. This article explores the potential of civic Internet use but concludes that many of our institutions are failing to rise to the challenge."</P>
<P>Several UK organizations have formed links with the US circuit rider movement, and the London Advice Services Alliance plans to launch a service later in the year. DirectSupport is demonstrating how community workers can—with backup support—extend their skills to help others make use of new technologies. </P>

<h3 class="title">New Directions in Publishing and Projects</h3>

<P><BR>With this spring issue, coming out so shortly after our winter offering, we're excited to be on a roll, with a new on-line, print on-demand format we're experimenting with, articles that intersect with our other involvements and work, including a new cable television/webcast experiment, new features we're planning to have as regular offerings including graphics by Matt Wuerker and a policy column by Robert Cannon, Director of the <A href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/">Washington Internet Project</A>&#151;and lots of new content and special pieces that we're excited about, following on the heels of our reader survey that drew overwhelming responses from you.</P><P>This issue's cover memorial to Toni Stone, founder of CTCNet, and the articles on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program, by Gabrielle Hammond, and on the Commonwealth Broadband Network supplement the <A href="http://www.cbcmedia.net/">premiere cable and web cast</A> of "First Tuesday"&#151;providing integrated on-request streaming video coverage and demonstrate, we think, a truly multi-media breakthrough.&nbsp; With issues like EITC, we need to present these stories in as many ways as possible. This important benefit program for low-income people has literally billions of dollars going unclaimed because 25% of those eligible still do not know about the program or how to file for benefits. The growing technology resources that are helping people obtain these benefits is a major story and development that needs to be told far and wide.</P><P>As the organizational publication for <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet</A> and <A href="http://www.afcn.org/">AFCN</A>, we have a special relation with their leadership and programs and in providing you with coverage of some of their major organization developments&#151;we trust their pieces encourage you to visit both organizational web sites for an even more up-to-date look at their resources. Two of our VISTA reports&#151;by Sharon Alhourani and Mary Grybeck&#151;are from members of the CTC VISTA Project. Continuing contributions by The Children's Partnership, Anne McFarland, Daniel Schackman (another CTC VISTA), Layton Olson, Frank Odasz, Randal Pinkett, and Terry Grunwald, plus a host of new contributors give this issue both a continuity and coverage of new projects and programs and alert us to new developments taking place during this period of consolidation.</P><P>We were pleased to have nearly 170 responses to our online survey in January. The survey results gave us a clearer idea of the makeup, needs, and interest of our audience: </P><DIV></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>54% of respondents had been reading the <I>Review</I> for less than a year.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Most respondents access and prefer the online version.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>76% expressed an interest in getting Special Reports and Publications.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Respondents fell into every work venue, including CTCs, other nonprofits, the public sector, schools and universities, for-profit enterprise, consulting, etc.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Many people offered topics and suggestions for future issues.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>We've since received articles from people who made inquiries through the survey form.</DIV></LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>It's been a successful evaluation, and we look forward to considering your recommendations further as the <I>Review</I> continues to develop and change, along with the community technology field itself.&nbsp; We're working on contributions for the next issue now, so if you've got something you'd like to submit for consideration, do let us know.&#151;<I>pm, rc, &amp; md</I></P></DIV>

<h3 class="title">The Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative and the Premiere of "First Tuesday"</h3>

<P>Community media and technology programming, integrating multi-site videoconferencing, simultaneously cablecast over community cable access stations throughout eastern Massachusetts and web cast everywhere the Internet is available, with live-time chat and available as video-on-demand—many of the dynamic features of Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative programs were developed over the preceding two years and reported upon by Reebee Garofalo in his winter '02 article on <A href="article.php?article_id=61">"The Greater Boston Broadband Network (GBBN): An Innovative University-Community Partnership."</A> Coalition partner organizations have been developing this state-of-the-art model since the inception of the CTC VISTA Project in the fall of '00, in part as an educational opportunity for their VISTAs.</P>

<P>When the GBBN transformed itself on the cusp of the new year, emerging from intense in-person and online conversations and planning discussions, reborn as the Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative (<A href="http://www.cbcmedia.net/">www.cbcmedia.net</A>), there was new energy and direction in the quantum leap that such a change suggests. And that change is most concretely seen in the development of a pilot monthly television and web cast show, building upon the kind of programsming developed earlier with Alan Shaw (on Technical Literacy, Civic Engagement and Social Empowerment), Charlotte Ryan (on media literacy—Drive-by Shooting: Race and Class in Mainstream News), George Stoney and Toni Stone (on the Origins of the Community Cable Access and Technology Centers Movements), and available in the <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/cbcmedia/archives.htm">CBC archives</A>.</P>
<P>"First Tuesday," in contrast with the more traditional academic didacticism of the earlier productions, is more dynamic, fast-faced, entertaining in style. With hosts Steve Provizer and Nettrice Gaskins introducing segments separated by a music and graphic multi-media opening, closing, and PSA roll-ins and transitions, the CBC is establishing a radically new kind of public space that extends well beyond the single community cable access station show on which it builds.  The February 4<SUP>th</SUP> premiere featured The CBC has begun distributing other locally-produced affiliated programs on other Tuesdays; March 18<SUP>th</SUP> premiered the first "Other Tuesday" program, a show initially cablecast on Cambridge Community TV on <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/cbcmedia/grassroots.htm">"The Internet and Grassroots Democracy."</A></P>
<P>In February the project was highlighted as one of the new innovations in broadband applications development, being featured at the <A href="http://www.apt.org/confer/2003bbforum.html">Broadband Forum</A> hosted by the Alliance for Public Technology at the Washington Press Club on February 21st and <A href="http://www.benton.org/Library/broadband/broadband-world.html">highlighted in their joint report with the Benton Foundation</A> on broadband development.</P>
<P>With lots of initial volunteer/donated time, talent, expertise, and effort and a budget of approximately $500 per show, CBC is in the midst of facing a series of challenges and opportunities for this kind of project that is sure to grow—developing production team coordination and cohesion; guidelines and procedures for "other Tuesday" programming, growing participation and membership; technical specifications and network infrastructure; fundraising proposals.  Stay tuned.</P>

The Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative (CBC) also featured a segment on "Remembering Antonia Stone: Founder, Playing to Win and the Community Technology Centers' Network (CTCNet)" on its premier edition of "<A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/cbcmedia/2.4.03.htm">First Tuesday</A> <A name=_Hlt36021370></A>" that is available as video on demand.</P><P><I>"We can all honor Toni's vision and the movement she spearheaded by continuing to work in our organizations and communities, and collectively through CTCNet and other like minded organizations, to make sure that individuals and families in underserved communities across our country, and around the world, have the opportunity to use technology to improve their lives. We have all lost a true champion as well as a strong and beautiful human being. However, her spirit lives on in all us who were touched by her.

<h3 class="title">CTCNet Update</h3>

<H3>CTCNet in 2002: An Eventful Year</H3><P>2002 presented CTCNet with many new opportunities and challenges. All in all, it was a banner year for the growth of the organization. Highlights include:</P><DIV></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>In October, CTCNet, together with its national partners, the <A href="http://www.ataccess.org/">Alliance for Technology Access (ATA)</A> and the <A href="http://www.ac4.org/">Association of Christian Community Computer Centers (AC4)</A>, received a $1.5 million award from the Department of Health and Human Services' Compassion Capital Fund to provide technical assistance and sub-awards to community and faith-based organizations. </DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Upon discontinuing its services, <A href="http://www.powerup.org/">PowerUP</A> offered its centers a one-year paid membership in CTCNet. Over 500 centers took advantage of this offer, boosting CTCNet's membership to over 1200 centers, with a presence in all 50 states. </DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Pursuant to one of CTCNet's strategic visions outlined by its affiliate-based Board of Directors, CTCNet created a Director of Programs and Policy position, located in Washington, DC.&nbsp; In October, John Zoltner assumed the position and officially opened CTCNet's first Washington, DC office. </DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>As a result of the newly funded <A href="http://www2.ctcnet.org/c4t/">Connections for Tomorrow</A>, CTCNet has opened three regional offices: Chicago, IL, San Diego, CA and San Francisco, CA. One full-time CTCNet staff person runs each office. Ben Cain relocated from Cambridge, MA to open the San Francisco office, currently subletting from CompuMentor, Ellen Garza opened the Chicago office, and Anne Neville Davis opened the San Diego office, housed by the <A href="http://www.pangeafoundation.org/">Pangea Foundation</A>.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>In September, Executive Director, Karen Chandler tendered her resignation from CTCNet, effective at the end of the year. Since that time, a Transition Committee from the Board of Directors, and including Stephen Ronan, Managing Director, has managed the search for a new Executive Director.&nbsp; An original pool of 60+ applicants was narrowed down to the 12 and then four, who came to Boston for in-person interviews. In January 2003, Kavita Singh accepted the post. </DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>In November, CTCNet published "From Policy to Action: Profiles of Washington Area Programs Making Progress on the Digital Divide"for&nbsp;the Washington Metropolitan Council of Governments. The report was presented at the Council's annual meeting. See below for a summary of this report.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>In December, CTCNet released its <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/consortiadirectory/">Regional Consortia Directory</A>, a first-ever guide to community technology networks around the country.</DIV></LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><H3>CTCNet Toolkit V 1.0 Arrives!</H3><P>Thanks to the work of consultant Paul Pitcher, along with the CTCNet staff, the revised <A href="http://www2.ctcnet.org/ctc/toolkit/main.html">Toolkit is now available online</A>.</P><P>The toolkit was created to share resources that can be used by CTCs getting started as well as those organizations that have long-established centers. The includes such resources as sample budget forms, policy documents, intake and evaluation procedures, technology plans, and curriculum materials, just to name a few.We see this is a continuing work-in-progress, so please let us know what you think of it, and if you have additional content to add.</P><H3>CTCNet Completes ACC Regional Development Project </H3><P>The America Connects Consortium has concluded a two-year project administered through CTCNet, to document and support the work of regional networks of CTCs and other organizations aiming to eliminate the digital divide.&nbsp; By bringing together these community technology leaders, the intention is to create added value to the work that each individual organization is doing by mutual support, resource sharing, fundraising, and a focus on regional interests.&nbsp; </P><P>One component of the regional development portion of ACC is the seed-funding grants. In early 2002, CTCNet selected 10 consortia to support at a critical stage of their development. Grants of $2,000 were provided to each of these networks. In some cases, the $2,000 meant the difference between getting off the ground and remaining in the idea-phase of a network. Examples of projects undertaken with the seed grant included securing an AmeriCorps*VISTA member through the CTC VISTA Project as a full-time regional coordinator and conducting the first-ever needs assessments of CTCs in a given area.</P><P>In all cases of the regional consortia, the impetus for development comes from the field. The activity and leadership is present and striving to institutionalize the network in some way. CTCNet aims to facilitate this growth while allowing specific objectives and project work to be defined by the regional network.</P><P>Though there are differences in the history of the development of each of these networks, almost all of the ten grantees are non-incorporated networks and collaboratives, rather than structured 501(c)3 organizations. The benefits of collaboration among those in the field doing the work in specific communities, without the strictures of a new level of bureaucracy, are strong and have great promise for building the field. That being said, there are some challenges that all of these regional networks share in the development phase that need to be addressed in order for them to run smoothly and maximize their potential.</P><P><B><I>Major challenges include:</I></B></P><P><B>Financial Resources:</B> Funding for the work of the networks, tapping into regional funding opportunities without detracting from individual funding for organizations.</P><P><B>Human Resources:</B> Staff to do the work of the networks. Right now most of these networks are operating with volunteers and VISTA members, with leadership provided by key members of the community technology field in their regions both individually (for example, as unpaid Executive Directors) and collectively (for example, as Steering Committees).&nbsp; </P><P>Another issue in that regard is the availability of people to do this work on top of their full-time job responsibilities.</P><P><B>Organizational Structure: </B>Defining a structure that can support the work that needs to be done and that provides continuity, sustainability, institutional memory, and the ability to create long-term goals.</P><P><B>Outreach: </B>Making sure that the networks include a critical mass of community technology and digital empowerment organizations in their respective regions, so that their knowledge base is being drawn upon for the benefit of all, and that they in turn can benefit from access to and participation in the regional networks.</P><P><B>Collaboration with other regional and national groups:</B> To draw on the strengths of these groups and not duplicate services.</P><P><B>Setting up regional work:</B> Some of the networks cover vast regions that require a commitment of time and money to bring members together in a central location.</P><P>It appears that these networks are well aware of these challenges and are planning strategically to meet them, either through steering committees or outside consultants.</P><P>The profiles document the regional consortia as they existed at the end of the seed funding program (September 2002). Each network was asked to capture its work in categories reflecting all aspects of the consortia, such as: Mission/Goals, Stage of Development Funding, Project Work and Impact, and Membership.</P><P>For more information, see <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/accregdev2002.htm">the full report</A>.</P><H3>Digital Empowerment in the Washington, DC Area</H3><P>In December 2002, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) commissioned a report by the Washington, DC office of CTCNet. The report, entitled <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/frompolicytoaction_v1.pdf">"From Policy to Action: Profiles of Washington Area Programs Making Progress on the Digital Divide,"</A>seeks to identify and profile model programs and services in the Washington, DC area whose policies and actions attest to an effort to eliminate the gap that exists between our nation's technology users and non-users. In November 2000, COG had established a Digital Divide Task Force to examine technology issues in the Washington metropolitan region. The CTCNet report is a major component of that work. "Our 'From Policy to Action' report is a testament to the amazing wealth of programs in DC, Maryland and Virginia that provide our communities with access to technology tools, content and skills," says John Zoltner, editor of the Report and Director of CTCNet's DC Office.</P><P><B>Best Practices</B></P><P>The report features organizations that, on the whole, demonstrate the degree to which the metropolitan Washington area is working to eliminate the digital divide for residents in recent years. For example, the District of Columbia Public Library provides more than 225 computers for public use, free of charge, and offers a customer training program. Fairfax County Public Schools enable an ethnically and economically diverse population of Kindergarten-6th Graders to have access to the computer lab as part of the regular curriculum and after-school programs. And in business, Community IT Innovators (CITI) and Confluence Corporation provide technology consulting to nonprofit organizations in the DC Metro area, as well as technology planning and assessment, Web development, software and network design, implementation and support.</P><P><B>Recommendations</B></P><P>Significant barriers still exist to achieving universal access for individuals and communities and eliminating the digital divide. In response, CTCNet interviewed a wide spectrum of influential people and organizations, analyzed statistics from the past decade, reviewed national reports on the topic and studied successful programs throughout the country. Through these exercises, CTCNet developed 12 recommendations for organizational change, which fall within three key areas:</P><P>1) Leveraging Relationships for Fundraising and Support</P></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=Section1>a. Require cable operator investment in local digital empowerment programs<BR>b. Make media mergers work for communities<BR>c. Leverage vendor relations on behalf of nonprofits working to close the digital divide<BR>d.Consider nonprofits when building out government data rings<BR>e. Make the Internet ubiquitous in affordable housing</P></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=Section1><P>2) Mapping Technology Resources and eGovernment</P></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=Section1>a. Map and make available to the public community technology access points</DIV><DIV class=Section1>b. Make eGovernment information and services available online</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=Section1><P>3) Innovative Community Program and Partnership Suggestions</P></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=Section1>a.

Sponsor family technology training initiatives</DIV><DIV class=Section1>e. Fund CTCs</DIV><DIV class=Section1>f. Support business partnerships</DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class=Section1><P>CTCNet and the COG Digital Divide Taskforce will continue to convene the stakeholders and decision makers in the region so that they can establish the Washington metropolitan area as a successful example of how a region can effectively make progress against the digital divide. From policy to action, they will make it happen.

<h3 class="title">AFCN Update Community Technology: New Times, New Tactics</h3>

<TABLE width=75 align=left border=1>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><IMG height=155 src="/spring-2003/gene.jpg" width=114></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Community Technology projects are under fire. Money is tight in a downturned economy; support for public interest work is increasingly difficult to find. Why should elected officials spend scarce money today to build lives and offer opportunity? They may well be retired by the time those people show up in hospitals and prisons.</P>
<P>Okay, that's vented. Now what do we do with the situation we actually face?</P>
<P>Community technology leaders have always dealt with inadequate resources for overwhelming needs. AFCN urges: don't buy into gloomy predictions of a dark future for community technology. Community technology leaders have always dealt with inadequate resources for overwhelming needs. If we work together, this year of crisis can bring more benefits than burdens.</P>
<P>At AFCN, we are feverishly addressing sustainability as one key issue, largely because so many CNs are facing vital deadlines for operations and payrolls. Fortunately some solid questions and promising initiatives are beginning to emerge. One fairly obvious example:</P>
<H3>Community Technology Integration: Centers, Networks, and... Commissions?</H3>
<P>All too often our projects become insular. Daily problems seem so pressing we don't have time to stay in touch with valuable allies, even in our own community. That has to change. AFCN recommends strongly CTC and CN leaders find time to meet with other local technology stakeholders. Perhaps monthly breakfasts? However you gather, invite ISPs, government leaders, economic developers, businesspeople, IT professionals... anyone with an interest in healthy growth of local telecommunications.</P>
<P>If a more formal structure appeals, help create a regional telecom advocacy organization. One good model is a 501c3 "commission," endorsed but not owned by your government(s).</P>
<P>Each "partner" group can retain its own identity and leadership in this collaboration. But together we can exchange information, share resources, and seek additional support.</P>
<P>I recognize collaborative efforts are hardly news for you. So if you have one already, support and energize it. If not, start one. The time has come to get serious about local control and activism.</P>
<P>Whatever you do, MEET! Get the mayor there. Ask bankers. Don't overlook service organizations. The work you do and capacity you help build matters to everyone.</P>
<P>Related questions:</P>
<UL style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<LI>Do you have both a CN and CTCs in your town? What's the difference? 
<LI>Is supporting separate programs becoming a burden? Could you serve better by closer cooperation or even merger?</LI></UL>
<P>Though autonomy, control and separate history are not always compatible it's usually worth the effort to explore sharing operations and facilities. Might help keep the doors open.</P>
<H3>Affordable, Accessible Software, Tools </H3>
<P>Two other current priorities for AFCN support of community technology leaders are basic: tools and training. We're preparing a report on powerful tools already available and usually free. Some overworked CN leaders may not yet know where to find assistance they may badly need. For example, have you noted the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/accregdev2002.htm">ACC Regional Development 2002 Report</A> and the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/consortiadirectory/index.html">Regional Consortia Directory</A> recently posted on the CTCNet website? Or the <a href="http://www.americaconnects.net/toolkit">self-evaluation toolkit</A> on AmericaConnects.net? You don't have to be a CTC; anyone can use these tools.</P>
<TABLE width=75 align=right border=1>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><IMG height=255 src="/spring-2003/gene_on_road.jpg" width=215></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD height=50>
<DIV align=center>
<P><I>Gene Takes a Call<BR></I><I>From the Home Office</I></P></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Another increasingly timely resource is the growing selection and sophistication of "Open Source/shareware/accessible/whatever" software. (Richard Stallman was just visiting, decrying the more common name "Open Source" &#150; but you know what I mean). Andrew Cohill and others have long recognized their value, and they're right. Flexibility and cost make these important options for efficiently-managed community technology projects. (For years MAIN/TCRC has been running Linux on some servers in our NOC, but since we are an R&D facility for community IT we expect and even presume high maintenance. So I hadn't realized how far open source has evolved. Now we have a local Open Source Forum to exchange information and advocate continuing development.)</P>
<P>If you are interested in more information on Open Source, and/or would like to volunteer to help in its development, please make contact via the <a href="http://www.afcn.org/comments.html">AFCN.org website</A>.</P>
<H3>Funding, Training</H3>
<P>In the last issue I discussed our new professional Community Network <a href="article.php?article_id=150">training programs</A>. For this issue I'll remind that we are responding to the lamentable reductions in federal government support for key community telecommunications programs like CTC, America Connects, NTIA/TOP, VISTA digital divide initiates, etc. State governments are cutting back as well. In Texas we currently have nearly 200 community networks, mostly funded by one program, now almost certainly being eliminated. I sadly predict we'll lose a number of them during the year ahead.</P>
<P>That's why we're pushing to identify support resources still available and working to assist CN leaders in participating in programs that fit their needs. The most recent example is our March 27, 2003 TOP grant workshop. TOP officials, whose outreach budgets are terribly slim, were wonderful about partnering with us to help inform prospective applicants about the 2003 RFP.</P>
<P>We're hurriedly working toward a second workshop like this, to be held in the DC area. Workshop information is posted on the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/conferenceworkshops/whoswhere.htm">TOP workshop web page</A> and on AFCN and CTCNet member lists. For information on this and other funding assistance programs, you can also contact Patti Clifford (<a href="mailto:pclifford@main.org">pclifford@main.org</A>).</P>
<H3>We Need Leaders!</H3>
<P>Are you willing to help out (and help your own efforts, too) by working with AFCN to gather information and develop resources? One immediate need is experienced "volunteer program" leaders able to coordinate basic online volunteerism. Please let us know if you can help. </P>
<P>New Mexico Milestone: Judith Pepper, member of the AFCN Board of Directors, reports the world-famed <a href="http://www.laplaza.org/">La Plaza Community Network</A> of Taos, New Mexico, is winding down operations. Judith and the La Plaza leadership decided the primary goals for which La Plaza was created have been met and, given increasing difficulty of economic sustainability, their time and efforts could be more productive in other activities.</P>
<P>Though this passage naturally brings some sadness, La Plaza will be recorded as one of community networking's clear successes. Plus there is the brighter news that Judith will be sharing her expertise and insights professionally, as a consultant for other communities.</P>
<P>This brings a question I'd like to ask AFCN members. As our profession matures we are blessed by a growing number of true experts, capable of assisting communities everywhere. When Steve Snow left Charlotte's Web and Andrew Cohill left Blacksburg Electronic Village, we added two assets to the small cadre of skilled consultants, like the legendary Frank Odasz.</P>
<P>And I can't mention them without noting other friends who are also genuine experts, like Terri and Karen and Richard and... see the problem?</P>
<P>So <EM>The</EM> Question: Would it be valuable for AFCN to create some sort of directory of qualified community network advisors? Your input is invited.</P>
<H3>Finally... Remembering Don Furth</H3>
<TABLE width=75 align=left border=1>

<TR>
<TD>
<DIV align=center><I><FONT size=-1>Don Furth</FONT></I></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>I'm sad to report a loss in our family. On February 27th, 2003, Don Furth of Rio Grande FreeNet passed away. Though not so widely known as our beloved Toni Stone, Don was one of the true pioneers of community networking in this country.</P>
<P>Upon retiring as a U.S. Army Ranger Sergeant Major with Purple Heart and Bronze Star, Don recognized great human need in the vast, economically struggling, geographically-isolated area surrounding El Paso, Texas (El Paso, in a different time zone from the rest of Texas, is closer to Los Angeles than to its own state capital.) So he founded the <a href="http://rgfn.epcc.edu/">Rio Grande FreeNet</A>, the first FreeNet in Texas, to offer access, education, and opportunity to hundreds of thousands in his community. </P>
<P>An unassuming but dedicated man, Don Furth embodied the best of our profession. He worked devotedly for this wonderful project until the day he passed away. His decency and commitment were truly an inspiration to those blessed by his friendship. This is not mere eulogy: Don was always there for us, offering quiet guidance and spiritual support, with his trademark warmth, wit, and wisdom. He will be greatly missed.</P>
<P>That's about it for this issue, except to say again: These are times we need each other more than ever. Please tell us how AFCN can best serve you and your community. And please join AFCN to help us make that happen. Thanks, Gene</P>

<h3 class="title">I-CAN Earned Income Credit Electronic Filing: Putting Money Back into Poor People's Pockets</h3>

<P>On the heels of welfare reform, putting money back into the pockets of our client community is a priority. And, while most low-income families would not turn away a check for $4,140, many unknowingly do just that by being unaware of the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit.</P>
<P>Referred to as EITC or EIC, the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit is a $31 billion program. It can return as much as $4,140 a year to a low-income working family, which dramatically impacts the lives of our clients. The average return is about $1,600. EITC is a credit. This means it returns more money to the low-wage earner than they put in through taxes withheld. To get it, a person simply needs to file their Federal tax return and the Earned Income Credit worksheet. It is important to note that low-income earners who did not claim the EIC in years past are entitled to file or amend prior returns for up to three years, and receive retroactive EIC. This potentially enables low-income tax filers to receive up to $12,000 at one time, assuming they have never filed for this credit and were eligible for it for each of the last three years.</P>
<P>For those who do claim this credit, the benefits extend far beyond one individual or one family. Statistics show that 80% of the income credit refunded to the family is spent within the community in which the low-income family lives. Generally, the money is spent on rent, utilities, and food and household products from community-based stores. Despite the potential windfall promised by the Federal EIC for communities and low-income families, billions of dollars are uncollected annually by eligible families and individuals. Many individuals do not file because they do not know about the credit. Many who do file often fall victim to high-priced "Refund Anticipation Loans" (RALs), commonly offered by most commercial tax preparation offices. While these loans speed an advanced payment to a worker by a few weeks (for workers who do not electronically file), the annual percentage rate on the advanced refund ranges from 100% to 700%. Persons who affirmatively answer the question, "Would you like your money right away?" unknowingly lose badly-needed funds.</P>
<H3><A href="http://www.icanefile.org/front/lang.aspx">Introducing I-CAN! Earned Income Credit (I-CAN! EIC)</A><BR></H3>
<P>I-CAN! EIC is a web-based application that helps low-wage earners file and complete their Federal tax forms for free. It has been created with funding by the Legal Services Corporation and is certified by the IRS as an online tax tool. It completes Federal tax forms for anyone eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit and allows users the option to electronically file their return. I-CAN! EIC also does the California state returns for users, when appropriate. A user does not have to look at tax forms or know before beginning if they can claim the EITC.</P>
<H3>How I-CAN! EIC Works</H3>
<P>It's easy: <A href="http://www.icanefile.org/">www.icanefile.org</A>!<BR>I-CAN! EIC is offered in Spanish, Vietnamese, and English. It uses a video guide to read simple questions that are on the screen to the user. The application has been translated at a fifth grade literacy level. The client answers the questions using a keyboard, at their own pace. When all of the questions are answered, completed tax forms are available for printing and electronic filing. If someone is not eligible for the Federal EIC, the I-CAN! EIC system will "exit" a user and link them to a site that tells them the volunteer tax preparation site nearest them.</P>
<H3>A National Network</H3>
<P>While I-CAN! EIC is a great web tool for our client community, its success will be rooted in the partnerships created around the country with programs that promote the service to its clients. To date, the I-CAN! EIC network involves <A href="http://www.icanefile.org/reglist/NewRegistrant7.asp">55 programs across 19 states</A>. Each program reaches hundreds or thousands of clients who could benefit from this credit. Partnering programs have committed at various levels: Some programs are putting the link to the web application on their site. Others are engaging in outreach and publicity campaigns about the EIC in their community and promoting I-CAN! EIC. A majority of programs are offering a computer workstation in their offices for clients to come in and access the system. A few programs are integrating I-CAN! EIC within their own client delivery systems by putting messages for clients to hear about I-CAN! EIC on their telephones while the client is on hold. Additionally, they are training their staff to route clients to the system even though the staff may be helping them with another social or legal matter.</P>
<P>This is the first national network created on behalf of low-income clients to help them put money back into their pockets. To support the national network, the Legal Aid Society of Orange County has developed trainings for programs to attend, which are offered "virtually" via web conferencing and are an hour and a half in length. Additionally, we have put together professionally-made Public Service Announcements (PSAs) that we send to each partner for them to use on their own radio and television stations. Each PSA has a spot where the program's name and number is advertised for more help. The spots inform clients in an easy way about the EITC, e-filing, and the I-CAN! EIC program.</P>
<H3>How to Partner</H3>
<P>To partner, a program leader can contact Gabrielle Hammond (see below). Alternately, a program can go online and register themselves as a partner. They will then receive additional information on trainings and a Memorandum of Understanding that needs to be signed. More information about the project can be found at <A href="http://www.icanefile.org/programs">www.icanefile.org/programs</A>.

<P><EM></EM><EM>This article is part two of a three-part series that shares case studies from the Creating Community Connections Project, an ongoing effort at </EM><A href="http://www.camfieldestates.net/"><EM>Camfield Esta</EM></A><A href="http://www.camfieldestates.net/"><EM>tes</EM></A><EM>, a predominantly African-American, low- to moderate-income housing development in Roxbury, MA, since 1999. As part of this project, MIT researchers have worked with residents to establish a technological infrastructure by offering every family a new computer, software, and high-speed Internet connection, along with comprehensive course and a web-based community building system. The project combines these elements in an effort to achieve a social and cultural resonance that integrates both community technology and community building by leveraging indigenous assets.</EM></P>
<P><EM>The first article in this series, </EM><A href="article.php?article_id=113"><EM>"Edna Jackson, Technology and Community Building: From Staunchest Opponent to Greatest Proponent."</EM></A><EM> a senior citizen and survivor of emphysema, and demonstrated the positive influence a community can exert on its members. This second installment portrays the experiences of the resident project leader Rodney Williams, a college student, and his evolution throughout the initiative, his involvement as an active agent of change, the social and cultural shift to becoming an active producer of information and content, and the benefits that are accrued.</EM></P>
<P>Rodney Williams joined the Creating Community Connections project team along with two residents (a brother-sister pair) and his younger cousin, whom he personally recruited to join the team. The remaining team members included representatives from the Tenants' Association and the Housing Finance Agency and researchers from MIT. Given his longstanding ties in the neighborhood and his prior experience with community-based projects (he successfully raised money to organize a local lacrosse program for urban youth), the team easily reached consensus that Rodney should be assigned the role of project leader.</P>
<P>Under Rodney's leadership, the project team was involved in a variety of activities throughout the summer of 2000. The team's primary responsibilities were to design and administer a preliminary assessment survey, organize an awareness campaign to solicit resident participation in the project, coordinate an asset-mapping initiative of local community resources (e.g., organizations, institutions such as libraries, schools, churches, businesses, etc.), and determine the user interface and functionality for the housing development website. To manage these tasks, team meetings were held once a week (at minimum) on-site at the development or on campus at MIT. A typical meeting included written and oral reports from each team member, project updates, strategy sessions, and weekly reading assignments and discussion.</P>
<P>Indubitably, the active participation of residents in each of these assignments was integral to the project's successful launch. For Rodney, the interviews provided a natural mechanism to converse with neighbors and simultaneously learn about community issues.</P>
<P>Being involved in the interviews was very important to me because it gave me a chance to get up close and personal with the residents and talk to them on a more initiate basis – more so than just the casual conversation that I normally have with some of them. I feel like I learned just as much from the survey and the survey results as I did from the off-the-record conversations that I had with the residents.</P>
<P>The asset-mapping initiative also generated numerous benefits. First, residents were able to identify local resources of potential benefit to themselves and their neighbors. This included child care facilities, youth-serving organizations, nearby businesses, etc., that would later be available on the housing development's website. Second, the information that was gathered provided an environmental scan of organizations with whom future partnerships could be forged, pending the results of the preliminary assessment. Third, and finally, the process itself heightened residents' appreciation of the assets located in their community.</P>
<P><I>I think it was important for [residents] to go out and find that information ourselves because that, in itself, was an exercise in community building. We are the ones that live here and this is going to benefit us and these are things that we should know – It was really empowering to see all of the things that were in the community.</I></P>
<P>Rodney's participation, as well as the participation of the other resident team members, appears to have had a positive impact on the project and each of them personally. Above all, their participation deepened their own levels of engagements as well as that of their neighbors.</P>

<P>As the fall was ushered in, the project moved from planning to implementation as Rodney and the other team members began to witness the fruits of their labor. The first cohort of families involved with the project (Round I) were interviewed in August 2000 and began taking courses at the community technology center (CTC) on the premises one month later. Rodney would periodically check-in on their progress as the team waived his participation in the courses because of his prior experience with computers and his contributions to the project to-date. The Round I participants would receive their computers and Internet connections just prior to the Thanksgiving holiday (the process of interviews and courses ramped up again in January 2001 for a second cohort of families during Round II).</P>
<P>In December 2000, the housing development's website went "live" as residents who completed the program were able to access the system online. For nine months after the system's launch, Rodney was noticeably absent as a contributor to the site he helped to design and implement. This was partly due to his busy schedule. However, there were other reasons to explain why his online participation lagged behind offline leadership. He was hesitant to contribute until others contributed, while others were reluctant to do so for exactly the same reason.</P>
<P><I>I thought, OK now we have this site up and initially I was thinking, "Why aren't people really communicating on there?" and "Why aren't people using it as much as they should?" but I don't know if I necessarily saw myself as one of those people. And then I thought to myself, "Well why aren't you contributing?" For some reason there was a disconnect.</I></P>
<P>Interestingly, one factor that accelerated Rodney's transition in this regard was his fundamental belief in the value of producing information and content in the digital age. Although his initial conceptualization of such activities was centered on global, rather than local contributions, the project has shaped and molded his thinking.</P>
<P><I>To really leave your mark and make your contribution you have to be able to produce and create something using that tool whether that is creating a website or contributing a line [or] a message on a chat room or a message board or whatever it is.</I></P>
<P><I>On a personal note, that's the only way I can feel validated. I have to feel like I use something as a means to get me to another point where I can produce something from it. I'm at a point where I want to make my contribution, and I've got a lot of different ideas that I'm working on now.</I></P>
<H3>From Passive to Active</H3>
<P>Presently, Rodney is spearheading a number of initiatives that are heavily informed by the results of the preliminary assessment, which identified issues such as a lack of activities for youth, and the need for improved community information and communication, safety/security measures, and employment opportunities for residents.</P>
<P>The shift that has taken place within Rodney is one that has involved varying degrees of "active-ness" at varying times along varying dimensions. Since the project's inception, he has been integrally involved in the process of building community at the development. On one hand, his ongoing participation in the interviews, recruiting, asset-mapping, website design, and other activities, have been key to the project's success. Furthermore, his participation and contributions to the virtual space at the development are now beginning to come to fruition.</P>
<P>Some of the online and offline activities he is involved with include a discussion forum for "Tenants Association Notices and Announcements" on the housing development's website; a forum created by the President of the Tenants' Association, after a meeting with Rodney; a partnership with the Boston Empowerment Zone to conduct job training and placement for residents that may be partially mediated online; and the return of the housing development's newsletter that was regularly distributed prior to renovation. Rodney will help design the newsletter in a paper-based and electronic format by working with the President of the Tenants' Association, the Director of Community Relations, and others.</P>
<P>Lastly, Rodney believes the project has benefited him as much personally as it has benefited the community. He feels he has a repertoire of positive, memorable experiences when his hard work and dedication have truly paid off.</P>
<P><I>I feel like participating in the project has made me a lot more connected with the community. A lot of that has to do with me having such a hands-on role in a lot of the interviews, the data gathering, the recruiting participants and so forth. It's made me more visible in the community. People are pretty willing to talk to me and have a conversation with them. I feel like just being in the project has definitely brought me a lot closer to people here and the community. I feel like I'm a trusted and respected figure.</I></P>
<P>Clearly, as a result of his active role in the project, Rodney feels more connected to the community than ever before.</P>

<h3 class="title">ConnectRichmond: Collecting and Sharing Information to Build a Stronger Community</h3>

<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 align=left border=1><TBODY><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=185><P><IMG height=98 src="/spring-2003/stutts_BM_LOGO.jpg" width=400></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>"What is the best that higher education can contribute to communities?" The <A href="http://oncampus.richmond.edu/connect/geninfo/campuspartnership.html">Campus Community Partnership of Metro Richmond</A> posed this question to community leaders. What they said is now changing the way local nonprofits work together. Together, academics and citizens developed <A href="http://www.connectrichmond.org/">ConnectRichmond.org</A>, a dynamic local nonprofit network and a website aimed at using information and technology to build the capacity of the local independent sector.</P><P>Decision-making in the last 20 years in Richmond, Virginia's conservative capital city, has been dominated by politics&#151;especially the politics of race and business interests. As in most of the country during this same time, the local nonprofit sector grew tremendously, yet still had no consistent voice in policy debates. Instead, it focused almost exclusively on the day-to-day challenges of critical need, a reality that forfeited the broader solutions offered through public policy.</P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 align=right border=1><TBODY><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=181><P><IMG height=282 src="/spring-2003/stutts_2.jpg" width=215></P></TD></TR><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=181><P align=center><FONT size=-1><I>"ConnectRichmond is a good example of the innovation that can arise from collaborative, community-driven research toward social change.&nbsp; The technology is relatively simple for a university to maintain and the information is a thoughtful application of the intellectual capital that is inherent in academic environments. The community supplies the ongoing creative impetus for social problem solving." Robert Hackett, Vice President, The Bonner Foundation</I></FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Seeing the potential for facilitating significant improvement, faculty member Richard Couto and a few students in the <A href="http://oncampus.richmond.edu/academics/leadership/">Jepson </A><A href="http://oncampus.richmond.edu/academics/leadership/">School of Leadership Studies</A> at the University of Richmond founded the Campus Community Partnership in 1993 to work with the nonprofit community to put the resources of higher education to work on community problems. Today, it remains a loose consortium of faculty and students from diverse area institutions&#151;J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, the University of Richmond (private, privileged, suburban), Virginia Commonwealth University (large, urban, public) and Virginia Union University (private, historically African-American).</P><P>For years, the Partnership staged special events, placed student volunteers in community and nonprofit programs, and sought answers to problems through community-driven research. Two years ago, through a series of community-wide meetings, the Partnership helped assess needs on a wider scale to develop the next phase.</P><P>Like many urban areas, Richmond and its surrounding counties struggle with a multitude of public policy issues and human service needs. Nonprofit, public agencies, and the citizens those agencies serve said that both resources and communication were fragmented. This fragmentation applied to those working to improve the quality of life and those seeking to access services. Strategic decision-making stalled, as did making a case to funders about market position, impact, cost effectiveness, or future direction. Organizations could not take full advantage of resources that would build each organization's capacity to do its job and reach its potential for public service.</P><H3>How the Resource Network Works</H3><P>At the heart of a diversity of requests was a need to be united&#151;hence ConnectRichmond was born in fall of 2001. At the core of the network is its first product, an email list that enables each member instant access nearly 600 Richmonders with an interest in community. Evaluation data indicate that users pass on messages regularly, reaching another 1,500-3,000 people. </P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 align=left border=1><TBODY><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=181><P><IMG height=243 src="/spring-2003/stutts_3.jpg" width=180></P></TD></TR><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=181><P align=center><I><FONT size=-1>Reginald Gordon: "Successful outcomes for the people we serve will be increased exponentially as we take advantage of the technology that brings us together and keeps us informed."

Last year, Reggie Gordon, Director of Homeward, Richmond's regional coordinating agency for homeless services, joined ConnectRichmond, Xperts, and DNDS.com, a local web design and hosting company, to work toward piloting this architecture among the homeless services organizations in the area. <LI><DIV class=Section1>Capital One, one of the largest employers in Richmond and an active corporate citizen, is partnering with ConnectRichmond to distribute recycled computers to nonprofit organizations in the metro area, monthly, beginning in April. </DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>A group of nonprofits led by the YWCA of Richmond, struggling with the "how to"of outcome evaluation, recognized that the information available on the web site could not move them from "knowing" to "doing," so the group asked ConnectRichmond to convene monthly gathering and link group members through an email list.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>The University of Richmond has received funding from the Jessie Ball duPont Fund to launch five, one-year faculty-student community alliances that will map geographic concentrations of needs, as well as locations of assets that meet those needs, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College and Virginia Commonwealth University, both Partnership institutions, have started small, college-based businesses that employ soon-to-graduate IT students to get hands-on experience serving the nonprofit sector with affordable networking services. </DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>A Chamber of Commerce youth initiative, Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Richmond are working with regional nonprofit organizations to capture and make available data that both small organizations and government offices already generate to facilitate resource allocation, strategic planning, and setting community, agency, and governmental priorities; community mobilization and self-direction; community and client needs assessments, grant writing, and advocacy; client tracking and service monitoring; and program evaluation and accountability to funders.</DIV></LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>The immediate goal of ConnectRichmond&#151;to provide the nonprofit community centralized access to information to make the most of each organization's assets&#151;is being realized daily. To operate ConnectRichmond, we are building elements of financial self-sufficiency, but still largely depend on generous grants from the progressive local Community Foundation serving Richmond &amp; Central Virginia and other local funders that value capacity building. The ultimate goal--to use knowledge to generate social change that improves the future for all citizens--will require transformation at the policy, organization and individual levels, which does not come quickly, simply or without rancor.

<P>Youth suicides hit an all-time high this past year in the <A href="http://www.yksd.com/">Yukon-Koyukuk School District</a>. At issue is how to get the word out that there is indeed hope for the youth in the villages as represented by the current Internet access in schools and the future plans for home-based high speed access. I spent six weeks in three district villages (Allakaket, Koyukuk, and Manley) this past fall and winter working to share the message "The Internet represents hope and we need to recognize the opportunities it puts at our fingertips." There have proved to be many social and political barriers.</p>
<P>Just as the famous serum run to Nome years ago saved lives despite great challenges, the immediate urgency is to bring the hope for a self-sufficient future to all remote Alaskan villages. Satellite and wireless technologies can now bring high speed Internet to nearly any point on the globe. Through a <A href="http://www.mcgrathalaska.net/">unique locally-owned ISP model</a>, McGrath, Alaska is one of the few villages that has succeeded connecting 70% of all homes with 1mb high-speed wireless for $40/month without E-rate limitations prohibiting home access and Ecommerce use.</p>
<P>After seeing limited benefits resulting from this access over the past few years, citizens in McGrath now realize that their level of benefits is tied directly to their learning specific skills for turning access into social and economic value. Education is the key to opening the doors to these new opportunities, both infrastructure and info-structure must be developed simultaneously. The community steering committee has developed a plan of action and an exceptionally articulate Powerpoint presentation detailing their vision. More information about "Transforming Rural Alaska Through Wireless Technology in the Schools and Community," including additional notes about McGrath, can be found in <A href="article.php?article_id=110">Martin Cary's article</a> <A name=_Hlt34882518></a>in the winter issue of the <I>Community Technology Review</i>. </p>

<P>Two days after returning from a three week stretch in Alaskan villages, I arrived in Jamaica for the <A href="http://www.ictjamaica.com/">National Information and Communications Technologies Conference</a>. After the -55F degree temperatures in Allakaket, Alaska, the warmth of Jamaica was most welcome. </p>
<P>I presented a televised keynote and shared the similarities of Alaskan and Jamaican villages in their struggle for cultural sovereignty and economic sustainability. Jamaica's hope is to unleash the inherent creativity of their 2.5 million citizens via E-learning and wireless Internet access. The goal of the conference was to create a measurably effective inclusion model to motivate citizens to get involved with ongoing training programs and to create a revenue model for sustainable telecenters. </p>
<H3>The Janitor Proved What's Possible</h3>
<P>Shortly after Jamaica, I returned to Montpelier, Idaho, population 2500, to participate in the three-day Bear Lake Technology Fair, sponsored by the Montpelier Ecommerce steering committee and Idaho State University. Montpelier has had 1mb high speed wireless available for several years, yet very few residents pay the $50/month because they don't understand how they might benefit. Shane Johnson is an exception. Retiring as the janitor from the local High School, Shane pursued his baseball hobby and created <A href="http://batsbatsbats.com/">a successful ecommerce business</a> selling baseball bats.</p>
<P>Shane has become very successful, filling a Fedex van daily with 50-120 packages of bats. Now he's expanding into other sporting goods supplies with several new websites. To raise local awareness about what broadband can offer to all Montpelierians, the local community steering committee is generating an ongoing series of local Internet awareness and training events to generate more local success stories. <A href="http://lone-eagles.com/montpelier-story.htm">"Homesteading the Ecommerce Frontier in Montpelier, Idaho"</a> summarizes where they are today.</p>
<H3>Building on Proven Successes</h3>
<P>Surely, after over ten years of experimental community networking and community technology center projects in the U.S. and Canada, we can identify the most significant lessons we've learned. As different as they may appear, people in Alaska, Jamaica, and Idaho are asking the same key questions.</p>
<P>1. What can we show and do to motivate our people to embrace the potential of the Internet?</p>
<P>2. What specific Internet training has proven to deliver the greatest real benefits in the least amount of time, particularly for low-literacy citizens?</p>
<P>3. Do successful models exist for economically sustainable community technology centers?</p>
<P>We might advise people asking these questions to pay attention to the lessons learned and to review the resources at key sites like those of the <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">Community Technology Centers' Network</a> and the <A href="http://www.afcn.org/">Association for Community Networking</a>. </p>
<P><B>The Missing Vision and "Call to Action"</b></p>
<P>As I teach about the potential of the Internet in remote communities, I'm uncomfortable with the prevailing assumption that American mainstream communities enabled with Internet access have embraced the full potential and are basking in enlightened empowerment as a result. Somehow we've lulled ourselves into believing the Internet is NOT a powerful self-directed learning medium with unlimited entrepreneurial potential. </p>
<P>As a nation, we've thus far missed the opportunity for a national "Call to Action" to unleash the historically unprecedented potential of the Internet for online collaboration and knowledge sharing, to come together as communities, and to demonstrate how a shared vision and focused collaboration can produce dramatic positive social and economic value. </p>
<P>But perhaps this is exactly where we find ourselves today, at this time in history where we all need to recognize the obvious, that only by working together can we do what needs to be done. Instead of bowling alone, if we learn to share our knowledge online, we'll all have access to all our knowledge.</p>
<H3>The New Gold Rush</h3>
<P>It is rapidly being recognized that all global communities and nations are in direct competition to determine the most effective means for unleashing the inherent human potential of their citizens using new, affordable educational information and communications technologies. "Mining raw human potential using free web tools." Those communities and nations that first prove how to unlock this human potential may enjoy a cottage industry for years to come, teaching others how to emulate their success. As Tom Grundner, founder of the early Freenets used to say, "It is just a matter of who and when."</p>

<h3 class="title">Programming on the Nightshift: It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time</h3>

<P><IMG height=64 src="/spring-2003/frustrated.gif" width=64>In an earlier <A href="article.php?article_id=69">Nightshift piece</A>, I talked about local information&#151;what it is, how we might access it, why it's important to community networks, etc. Some of the information is general info that it helps to know if you live in a certain community: things like the hours at City Hall, the names of councilpersons, etc. But there's a lot of information that is very individual, the kind Tom Grundner talked about when he talked about the "radius." That's the individual expertise type of information. With either kind, the question is how to get the information both <I>to</I> and <I>from</I> the community. </P>
<P>Like most community networks, <A href="http://www.chuh.net/">mine</A> needs to let folks know that we're around so that we might collect the information that they have. This, of course, is the reason that public relations professionals flourish. However, we don't have money to hire one, so we try to do what we can. And considering that all of us have had lots of experience with different nonprofits, we do have some knowledge of various ways to get the word out.</P>
<P>In the last days of the warm, laid-back summer, our hardy core group gathered for dinner and decided that we would do more than have monthly meetings that were open to anyone who might have heard of us and wanted to put up a website. A number of people had come&#151;and continue to come&#151;to those meetings, representing various community groups, and we're hosting a reasonable number of local websites. But in the tradition of those who are excited about the web and what it can do for communities, we thought we'd actually do some programming to attract folks to our site.</P>
<P>We figured that we'd alternate these programs with the "working" meetings, and we chose dates for four community programs. Everyone took responsibility for something, and my job was organizing and publicity. We printed an attractive flyer, distributed it, and reserved space for the meetings at the public library.</P>
<P>Our first program was "Build It and They Will Come," a title that we were sure would get attention. It featured a panel of the folks who had already built websites with the hope that they might encourage the more timid nonprofits to get going on their websites. We got very good publicity from the weekly newspaper, but only the presenters showed up.</P>
<P>Instead of just going home or out for a beer, the panel gave their presentations to each other, and those of us on the board found great things that we didn't even know were on the site&#151;the case of the networkers being too busy to look beyond the home pages! One of the presenters, a non-techie, put together a really nice document that other non-techies could use in building their sites. Actually, one library patron did wander in and seemed interested in what we were doing, but as for attracting real community participation, our program was a complete bust.</P>
<P>Our next scheduled presentation was the brainchild of one of the trustees, a retired medical librarian who's formed a nonprofit to collect books for third world countries. Considering the state of the Cleveland Public Schools, he gives a goodly number of books to local teachers as well. His concept is that there are a lot of people in our community who have similar international connections around many other endeavors. He's heard about a lot of them by word-of-mouth, and he had a sense that a program on facilitating international connections on the web would be a good boost for the community.</P>
<P>But this concept is hard to articulate, let alone reduce to a catchy title. So a planning meeting ended without a decision about what to call the program. Promises were made to get material to me ASAP.&nbsp; But a few weeks later nothing had shown up. I put out email asking if we should cancel the program. "Oh no," the concept person said. "I've got people lined up." But two days before the program, he called to tell me that he thought we'd better cancel it. I bit my tongue instead of saying, "I told you so," but I made him call the library to cancel the room.</P>
<P>Still, I figured that our next meeting would be a go, and I was excited about it. Because of a joint school district, we serve two communities. And we are curious about the technology plans&#151;or lack thereof&#151;of these two communities. So the idea was to invite appropriate people from each city hall to join us to talk about the plans. We figured publicity would be easier to get in this case, since both cities have fairly formidable public relations offices.</P>
<P>Way back in the summer, the techies had agreed to organize that program. Therefore I hadn't worried about it at all, since they always come through. But after we cancelled the international program, I thought maybe it would be a good idea to remind them of their promise. So I sent out an email, to which the first response was: "Which presentation was going to be next? The ecology program or the technology plan program?"</P>
<P>
I had to let that one sit overnight before I could respond. Otherwise my email would have shouted, "AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO LOOKED AT THE PROGRAM THAT WE DISTRIBUTED?" </P>
<P>At the next meeting we decided that we really couldn't do these programs by ourselves. I sulked because I thought that the city technology plan program was a really good idea. One of the members suggested that we ask the city councils to put on a program addressing that topic. Instead of saying, "LIKE THAT WILL WORK!," I said that I really didn't think the cities would follow through and that I was really sorry that we couldn't do that program.</P>
<P>But I said that I understood&#151;as much as anybody else&#151;exactly why we couldn't do it. There's only so much one can do on the Nightshift. We have a site up and running. We host a dozen organizations. We have a forum. Not bad, really, for the Nightshift. So we were a little ambitious about the program planning. I still hope that we plan at least one program for next year. I have a Charlie Brown-like faith that the football won't always be yanked away at the last second. Community networkers are like that!</P>

<h3 class="title">San Diego Cyber Y: This Is the Life!</h3>

Who would have thought that I would get to play for a whole year? I joined AmeriCorps*VISTA August 2002. My year is approaching the half way mark and I am still having a great time.</P>
<P>I am at the Cyber Y Technology Center in San Diego, CA. We are a part of the Youth &amp; Family Services Department of the YMCA. We serve poor and underserved families in the North Park area providing computer learning courses and open access. We have a variety of participants, but mostly young Hispanic families with one or both parents working.</P>

<P align=center><I>It was great to go from hearing the children cry, "My computer doesn't work," to using computer programs to draw monsters, cut and paste pictures of their favorite heroes, and play the most sophisticated video games.</I></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>We started a Cyber Y Afterschool Kids Club last fall for 3<SUP>rd</SUP>, 4<SUP>th</SUP>, and 5<SUP>th</SUP> graders. JCPenney was good enough to fund the program. We meet twice a week, and not only do the children learn computer skills, but we have tutoring sessions for the ones that need help with their homework. Since I started my service the end of August, I hit the ground running. My first task was to come up with a plan of action, and that turned out to be quite a challenge. Most of the children are native Spanish speakers and have not been in this country for very long so their reading skills are still being developed. We needed a program that would be lots of fun and not too frustrating for them. It was great to go from hearing the children cry, "My computer doesn't work," to using computer programs to draw monsters, cut and paste pictures of their favorite heroes, and play the most sophisticated video games. I think I have the most fun when I am searching for new and inventive things for us to do in class. If I can find a Harry Potter game or a Treasure Island game with really terrific graphics, that the children can learn to use the controls, follow directions, and improve their dexterity&#151;boy, what more can I ask for? 
<P>My partner at the Cyber Y, Adrian Valdez, and I have learned that it is very difficult, due to the different levels of maturity, to have the younger children and the older children in the same class. The older children were ready for a much more challenging program. While the older children were willing to help with the younger ones, they really needed more creative space. In our next session we will have the 5<SUP>th</SUP> graders in a separate session. I have also asked the teachers at the local elementary school to have some input into an online tutoring the program that we will be using to help the children with their studies during our tutoring session.</P>
<P>This is not the only fun available&#151;we have Cyber Parents classes that are available in English and Spanish. It was my first experience giving a class with a translator. We all had great fun and everybody got to laugh at my Spanish or better yet, at me misunderstanding <I>their</I> Spanish.</P>
<P>A Cyber Senior class is offered for the young at heart. It was a delight to let the participants know when they called to sign up for the course that there was, "no way they would or could break our computers." After eight weeks, both seniors and computers were very much intact. Now they have learned the joys of shopping online, even for groceries if they like.</P>
<P>In addition we provide the OZ Teen Shelter, another program of the Youth &amp; Family Services, with a computer-based project once a week. These kids have a lot of talent and imagination. They are here from 9:30 a.m. until noon, once a week, so there is plenty of time for them to come up with a great presentation at the end of the session, like having them come up with a virtual month-long trip to Europe with only $2,000 in their pockets.</P>
<P>What amazes me is that this is all being accomplished with a director, a part-time person, and me. Could you imagine what we could do with more money, personnel, and time?</P>
<P>Of course it is not all fun and games, but I find learning is done best if you are having a good time. Writing curriculum is one of my favorite things to do. I'm attending grant writing workshops given by a local company, Grant Writing Specialists. Their motto is: "Helping those that help others." They truly love non-profits and have been very helpful in adding to my skills.</P>
<P>I would say that my biggest challenge is finding enough time in the day. When they say this will be the hardest job you'll ever love&#151;they aren't kidding.</P>

<h3 class="title">In Seattle with the Rainier Vista VISTA</h3>

<P>My VISTA position is serving as Technology Coordinator at the <A href="http://www.sea-pha.org/development/rainiervista/rainiervista.html">Rainier Vista Housing Development,</A> which is only a few miles south of downtown Seattle in Rainier Valley. Yes, I am nowthe Rainier Vista VISTA.</P>
<P>Rainier Vista as a community is in a state of transition; a recent recipient of a huge <A href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/programs/ph/hope6/index.cfm">HOPE VI</A> redevelopment grant, the community is now on the first phase of a project to rebuild all the housing in the community. The old housing was built in the early 1940 for defense workers, and is coming to the end of its useful lifespan. While at one time about 400 families lived in the community, there are currently 250-300 families living on-site, while the other 100+ families have relocated off-site for the duration of the rebuilding process. Our community includes Native Americans as well as many cultures from Africa and Asia - Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, Somali, Ethiopian, Oromo, Eritrean, etc.</P>

<P>The computer labproperlyreferred to as the "Rainier Vista Job Resource and Technology Center." Its primary function has been to provide opportunities and toolsfor adults to find jobs and to improve their computer skills to find better jobs. In past, my predecessor (and current supervisor) also acted as a job coach&#151;providing case management servicesin addition to technology assistance.While I don't offer the same case management services,Ihelpvisitorslearn to use our resume and cover letter templates and navigate online job search sites. In addition, I'm writing some grants to keep us "in business," working to upgrade our systems, and developing partnerships with other organizations to broaden our services. Currently, in partnership with the <A href="http://mytown.koz.com/servlet/community_ProcServ/GID=01207001300995039868582293">Literacy Council of Seattle</A>, we are starting Beginning and Intermediate ESL programs that will utilize computer resources to help people learn English. In addition,the <A href="http://www.rewa.org/main.html">Refugee Women's Alliance</A> is holding FamilyLiteracy classeswith a technology component, and I am working to get a G.E.D. program started with Project Farewell.</P>
<P>We do allow kids to use the computers, but to a limited extent. Kids are expected to use the center to do homework or learn skills&#151;not always an easy expectation to enforce! Games aren't allowed, and chat room usage is very limited. We have a fabulous typing program, Typing Quick and Easy, which kids are expected to practice for the first 15 minutes they are here. Just yesterday, I was being interviewed by Michele, a reporter for the <A href="http://www.neighborhoodhousewa.org/voice_about.htm">Voice</A>, the newspaper for all the public housing communities here in Seattle. She mentioned that at another housing development, Yesler, there was a great deal of difficultly in getting adults into their computer lab, because it was overrun with kids. I'm very thankful that my supervisor, Rhonda, has worked so hard to focus on making the lab a place for adults. There are any number of children's programs for the kids in the community&#151;an after-school art program, the Boys and Girls Club, a garden program, after-school tutoring, sports&#151;however the JRC is really the only place adults can go in the community to get out of the house. I am working to develop one children-oriented program for the lab, however.The after-school art program may be coming into the lab once a week or fortnight to learn web design or do other focused art projects on the computer. </P>
<P>That's all for the moment... Greetings from Seattle!</P>

<h3 class="title">An Illinois Consortium at the Digital Crossroads</h3>

<H3>15 Members join Illinois Consortium to assist CTCs and to build statewide organization to promote digital literacy</H3><P>In August 2002, 15 community technology networks&#151;including <A href="http://www.luc.edu/curl/prag/ctcnet.htm">CTCNet Chicago</A>, <A href="http://www.prairienet.org/">Prairienet-Champaign</A>, and <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet</A> as a national organization&#151;social service and settlement house organizations, and university community service programs from across Illinois signed an historic document to become members of a statewide community technology enterprise. The signing of the <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/consortiadirectory/region5/ilctc.htm">Illinois Community Technology Consortium</A> agreement took place after two years of informal and one year of formal work together as a cooperative consortium to make the best use of $1.3 million over three years under a Request For Proposal (RFP) issued in September 2001. The Consortium name was adopted to reflect the state-level relationship with CTCNet. The use of the abbreviation "ILCTC" reflects relations with similar statewide affiliates of CTCNet, identifiable by two letters.</P><P>The RFP was issued by the <A href="http://www.ictf.org/">Illinois Community Technology Fund</A>, a nonprofit organization composed of community, public official and telecommunication parties created under the Ameritech-SBC merger in September 1999. The RFP requested services for professional development assistance to community technology centers across Illinois and the creation of a sustainable statewide organization. Given the extent of the services requested, the Consortium submitted an application in December 2001 to use the $1.3 million to help raise another $2.7 million in resources from public agencies, companies, foundations and earned revenue, to provide a total of $4 million in services. The consortium was awarded the grant in an announcement in April 2002 by Governor George Ryan. The "Connecting My Community" program formally began in July 2002 with a goal to provide direct services to directors, trainers, tech staff, and volunteers in&nbsp;five circuits which are the multi-county service areas used by the <A href="http://www.extension.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois Extension</A>.</P><P>In October 2002, these members working through four committees (member services, connectivity, sustainability, and management) met in Urbana to plan the startup.

<h3 class="title">The Cybertelecom Report: Networks and Copyright Infringement: DMCA Immunity</h3>

<H3>The Unregulated Internet? Where?</H3><P>Since the first great legislative confrontation concerning the Internet, the Communications Decency Act, the mantra in Washington has been to keep the Internet "unfettered" from legislation and regulation. But regulatory creep has founds its ways to the shores of cyberspace, and slowly but surely, the Internet has been encumbered by federal regulation.</P><P>This new column is dedicated to exploring federal initiatives that impact the Internet and what this might mean for community networks and CTCs. Some of these are obligations and pitfalls; some of these are opportunities and benefits. This column will explore how you can take advantage of these initiatives.</P><P>This column is meant to be a general discussion akin to talking about how you might change your life to avoid heart attacks. It is designed to be an educational tool.&nbsp; It is not meant to be a replacement for surgery. In other words, this endeavor should better educate you about the issues, the questions, and things you might look into. But it is not a replacement for legal advice.</P><H3>The Digital Millenium Copyright Act</H3><P>To set off upon the right foot, the first topic of discussion is an opportunity. Telephone carriers are immune from copyright infringement lawsuits for their subscribers because they are "common carriers." By definition, a common carrier is not responsible for the content or goods that it carries. I could read to you Sartre's <I>Being and Nothingness</I> over the phone and the phone company would never be liable if that were infringing activity.</P><P>Is this true of Internet networks? After all, many Internet networks, like telephone networks, are involved in nothing more than carrying the bits. They are not involved in the creation or requesting of the content. They merely provide the conduit. But Internet networks have never been declared "common carriers." Further, many large copyright stakeholders who cannot reach out and touch the actual infringers have sought to make networks liable for third party infringement.</P><P>Enter the <A href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf">Digital Millenium Copyright Act</A>. Some community networks want to provide Internet connectivity to their constituency. Some of these constituents will find new and cool things like Napster and other music sharing services, and some of these constituents might be engaged in copyright infringement. In situations such as these where the network is neither the provider nor the requester of the infringing content, where the network is merely providing transmission, the DMCA provides a defense to the network for contributory copyright infringement liability. In order to qualify for this immunity, the network must implement a policy for dealing with subscribers who are repeat offenders and not interfere with technical efforts to protect content.</P><P>A lot of networks give their constituents the opportunity to host webpages and store content. Here too the network can be protected from liability where it has no hand in or direct benefit from the creation of that content (a direct benefit would be deriving revenue from the website itself as oppose to revenue from merely hosting the website). In addition to the previous requirements, the network must not know that the content is infringing, must name an agent for service of process, and must comply with notice and take down.</P><P>To name an agent, the network should fill out the "Designation by Service Provider of Agent for Notification of Claims of Infringement" <A href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp">form</A> <A name=_Hlt35631070></A><A name=_Hlt35630804></A>and send it to the Copyright Office along with a check for $30. The network should also post the name of the agent on its website.</P><P>Now the network must do the dance of notice and take down. Where an alleged copyright owner provides proper notice to the network of an alleged infringement, the network is to take down the identified content. Notice is then given to the content creator who has the right to counter notice. If the content creator says, no no no, that is legitimate legal content, then the network must provide notice to the copyright owner that the content will be restored in 10 days. The network must then restore the content unless the network receives notice that the copyright owner has filed suit.</P><P>This is, of course, the DMCA dance in five minutes. The details are more elaborate. What you should walk away from this with is that you may wish to name someone on staff to be the DMCA agent and have that person become well versed in how the DMCA works. These provisions of the DMCA can be found in Title 17, Chapter 5 of the United States Code, <A href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17">Section 512</A>.</P><P><HR>Robert Cannon (<A href="mailto:cannon@cybertelecom.org">cannon@cybertelecom.org</A>) is Senior Counsel for Internet Issues in the FCC's Office of Plans and Policy.

For a counterpoint to Debbie Goldman's perspective here, see <A href="article.php?article_id=51">Bruce Kushnick's</A> commentary and analysis.</I></P>
<P class=Section1>

<DIV class=Section1>
<H2>Regulatory Policy Must Encourage Network Investment: UNE-P Policy Does Not </H2></DIV>
<DIV class=Section1>The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) missed an opportunity in its recent Triennial UNE Review to set an effective national policy that would promote facilities-based competition and investment in telecommunications. </DIV>
<P class=Section1></P>
<P class=Section1>The FCC's decision to shift to the states decision-making on UNE-P &#150; the unbundled network element platform &#150; for voice telephony sets up policy battlegrounds in each of the 50 states. The key decision the FCC punted to the states is over local switching, which competitors combine with local loops into a platform known as UNE-P for resale.</P>
<P class=Section1>Fortunately, on broadband, the FCC's action does encourage investment by removing new fiber investments from the unbundling requirements, thereby moving policy in the right direction to promote the availability and access of information technology for all.</P>
<P class=Section1>The goal of regulatory policy must be to encourage facilities-based competition, not resale. Resale brings nothing new to consumers &#150; it is simply rebranding of the incumbents' network. Real consumer choice depends on competitive offerings that use different technologies to drive innovation, new services, and improved quality. </P>
<P class=Section1>Proponents of UNE-P unbundling and pricing policies argue that resale is necessary to jumpstart facilities-based local competition. They point to the long-distance model, whereby new entrants such as MCI and Sprint used resale of AT&T's network to generate revenues and customers as they built their own networks. </P>
<P class=Section1>But this model fails for several reasons. First, should public policy aim to jumpstart building a second telephony wire into the home? Is that realistic, given the ubiquity of the telephone network? Or is the future for local competition between companies offering service using different technologies &#150; telephony wires, cable wires, and wireless? If so, public policy should focus on ensuring a level playing field for competition to drive investment in networks using all these technologies.</P>
<P class=Section1>Second, to return to a focus on wireline telephony competition, the critical issue is to ensure that UNE-P pricing sets the appropriate investment incentives for incumbents and new entrants alike. If resale prices are below-cost, new entrants will never invest because it is cheaper to rent. Likewise, incumbents will put no new money into the network, because they can't recover their costs. Service quality will deteriorate, and deployment of new and advanced services will be delayed. Resale customers suffer as well from deteriorating networks, since their service rides on the incumbents' network.</P>
<P class=Section1>This is effectively the impact of UNE-P prices on telecom investment. Residential telephone rates have historically been set below-cost to encourage universal service, offset by above-cost pricing to business customers and for features such as call waiting and call forwarding. Competitors currently use UNE-P prices to resell local service to high-revenue customers. The incumbent is left with low-revenue customers. If competitors siphon off the high-revenue retail customers that subsidize those rates, incumbents don't recover the cost of the network. </P>
<P class=Section1>According to stock analyst UBS-Warburg, the Bell companies lose an average of $18 in revenue and almost $15 in profits for each UNE-P resold line.</P>
<P class=Section1>Incumbent Bell companies have now resold about 10 million UNE-P lines. Last year they cut capital expenditures by $13.8 billion, or 35 percent over the prior year, and slashed more than 30,000 jobs of front-line technicians who build, repair, and maintain the lines. To be sure, the economic downturn and other management policies account for much of the decline. But revenue loss due to below-cost UNE pricing played a role as well.</P>
<P class=Section1>As noted earlier, the FCC decision did the right thing on broadband, removing new investments in fiber technology from the unbundling regime. Getting investment incentives right is essential to encourage broadband deployment. </P>
<P class=Section1>But the states must now also get it right for voice telephony. The critical decision is whether competitors are "impaired" without access to local switching at UNE prices. Competitors have placed more than 1,300 circuit (voice) switches in local telephone wire centers that serve 86 percent of all access lines and have deployed at least 1,700 packet (data) switches. Competitors serve more than 20 million lines using their own switches. </P>
<P class=Section1>Removing local switching from the UNE regime will not impair competition. Rather, it will facilitate the transition to facilities-based competition by encouraging competitors to move customers' lines onto their own switches. Incumbents will still be required by law to provide non-discriminatory access to their networks to ISPs. </P>
<P class=Section1>Resale competition based on UNE-P prices creates the illusion of competition but it comes at high cost to consumers. It undermines any incentive for new entrants and incumbents alike to invest in current and new networks, services, and technologies. </P>
<P class=Section1>We need more investment in telecommunications networks to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, quality broadband services. According to the FCC's most recent report, only about 14 million American households subscribe to high-speed Internet services. Cost, access, and quality continue to be barriers. With proper investment incentives, economies of scale and competition between competing technologies can drive down cost and build-out of networks with new services. </P>
<P class=Section1>Market incentives alone will not close the digital divide. There will continue to be a role for public subsidies and programs such as support for Community Technology Centers (CTC) and the Technology Opportunity Program (TOP) to ensure that all Americans have affordable, quality high-speed broadband. But getting the regulatory incentives right is a first step. The FCC did the right thing for consumers by removing broadband from the below-cost UNE pricing regime; now let's hope the states do the right thing on voice telephony.</P>

<h3 class="title">Point / Counterpoint: The FCC's New Broadband Rules</h3>

<P><I>Ed. Note: The February 20<SUP>th</SUP> press release by the Federal Communication Commission, <A href="http://www.fcc.gov/competition/proceedings.html#triennial">"FCC Adopts New Rules for Network Unbundling Obligations of Incumbent Local Phone Carriers,"</A> has many technical dimensions, but, as a major competition policy proceeding, it's been greeted by widespread comment among community communication specialists as well as the corporate community. As with a previous <A href="article.php?article_id=96">Point</A>/<A href="article.php?article_id=97">Counterpoint</A> exchange involving different points of view on the Tauzen-Dingell bill, we present here two differing perspectives on this recent decision. For a counterpoint to Bruce Kusknick's perspective here, see <A href="article.php?article_id=50">Debbie Goldman's</A> commentary and analysis.</I></P>
<P>
<P>
<HR>

<H2>About the New Local Competition and Broadband Rules</H2>
<P>The goal of the FCC's rule making was supposed to fulfill the Telecom Act's primary goals: to bring in competition that would lower prices and to bring America broadband. The FCC's incoherence in this proposed plan is exposed by the fact that almost every commissioner is dissenting on some part of it, except for Kevin Martin (whose proposal won the day). </P>
<P></P>
<P>For a longer discussion of what's wrong with Martin's Plan, see <A href="http://www.newnetworks.com/dearcommissionermartin.htm">the critique of his speech last December</A>. </P>
<P>What we got was essentially a Rube-Goldberg contraption that makes reading a phone bill look simple.</P>
<P>The primary winners of this entire process are the lawyers, who will now have a field day in all of the ill-conceived rulings and next steps. The winners are definitely not most competitors, and definitely not the customers and consumers of broadband or competitive local phone services.</P>
<H3>Voice Competition and UNE-P</H3>
<P>When a competitor wants to use the network it has been able to purchase specific parts of the phone network, commonly known as unbundled network elements (UNE), or purchase a combination of UNEs that allow end to end service delivery. This is known as UNE-Platform (or, more commonly, UNE-P).</P>
<P>And the only competitors that won at some of this decision are those that sell local phone UNE-P services in specific states &#150; states that like competition. Instead of a coherent national policy, the FCC dumped these issues in the laps of the under-funded, politically attached state public service commissions, and this means 51 state commissions now have to have separate proceedings to determine the rates for companies &#150; and this will mean law suits in every state. And, of course, each state has its own opinions of competition, or the lack thereof.</P>
<P>At this point, prior to the final order being issued, to assess what all the details are likely to be, one needs to consult the press release's fine print. For example, if the state decides to not act and does not do a proceeding on UNEs, then the Bells will no longer be obligated to resell their services to competitors in that state... And caveats abound. For example, the Bell companies do not have to sell services that use packet switching. "Incumbent LECs are not required to unbundle packet switching, including routers and DSLAMs, as a stand-alone network element."</P>
<P>"The order eliminates the current limited requirement for unbundling of packet switching." Packet switching, the sending of small digitized packets of information that make up, say, a web site or a phone call, is the primary way the Internet, Voice over IP, DSL and most other services work these days.</P>
<H3>The Broadband Wipe Out &#150; Regulated Line Sharing Is Killed Off</H3>
<P>For a commission interested in stimulating broadband deployment, the stupidest thing to do is to get rid of services competitors are already using. For example, today, an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (i.e., Verizon, SBC, BellSouth, Quest) can be required to share its phone line for a reasonable fee with a company offering DSL on the same line using a frequency higher than what is used for voice traffic.</P>
<P>This new FCC decision says that line-sharing is no longer going to be available under regulated rates, and within three years the ILEC will have the right to terminate their competitors' DSL service that is being used by many residential customers.</P>
<P>Talk about a chilling effect on every company that offers services using line-sharing, or everyone who owns stock in companies that have based their business plans on line-sharing. According to Powell, "40% of DSL providers use line shared inputs. The decision to kill-off this element and replace it with a transition of higher and higher wholesale prices will lead quite quickly to higher retail prices for broadband consumers."</P>
<P>We expect that this activity alone could destroy the entire Internet Service Provider market and the Competitive Local phone companies (CLECs) that depend on line-sharing &#150; who's going to invest in a company whose major business dies in three years?</P>
<H3>Customer-Funded Networks Given to the Bells for Personal Use</H3>
<P>But what truly separates the simply bad ideas from the truly bad ideas is the fact that the FCC's decision essentially turns over the entire future of wireline broadband to a group of four companies whose broadband track record has been abysmal. The FCC plans states that if Bells upgrades their current networks with fiber, they have exclusive rights to the networks and do not have to resell it to any other company.</P>
<P>This week we filed a complaint with the FCC pointing out that their broadband data was seriously flawed. It neglected the facts. In most states, the Bell companies promised to deploy fiber-optic based broadband services in exchange for financial incentives in the form of higher phone rates. And the facts show that NO Bell company built any of the promised networks, even though customers paid for it.</P>
<P>For example, in Pennsylvania, Verizon PA is being held accountable for its promises to have half of the state wired with a fiber-optic 45 mps two-directional service, including all rural, urban and suburban areas, by 2004. In <A href="http://www.netntworks.com/prpenncomplaint.htm">our complaint with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission</A>, we estimate that the Bell collected $785 per household &#150; $2.1 billion dollars, in excess fees to date and there's no network in sight.</P>
<P>But the FCC is betting that giving the Bells exclusive access to any new fiber-based networks will make these companies actually build something.</P>
<P>More to the point, all customers reading this should realize that they <I>already</I> paid for the development and implementation of fiber networks that, if ever actually built, will now be solely owned, without any obligation to allow competitors to use these networks, as noted in our <A href="http://www.newnetworks.com/FCCbroadbandcomplaint.htm">recent Complaint with the FCC</A>.</P>
<H3>What's Missing?</H3>
<P>These entire proceedings have been stacked against the small businesses, not only small business Internet and broadband competitors, but also small businesses that depend on these services. In fact, the <A href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/laws/comments/fcc03_0205.html">Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy stated</A> <A name=_Hlt35669861></A>that the FCC should have revised its entire process because it did not take into account its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires the FCC to examine the impacts its laws will have on small businesses.</P>
<P>Second, on the issue of pricing of UNE-P, the Bell companies continually complain that they lose money from selling below cost to the competitors.</P>
<P>The FCC has never bothered to just take out an annual report or 10Q and examine the profits of these companies. It shows that the Bells' profits have continually increased and they are still some of the most profitable companies in America &#150; all from local phone services. Also, the FCC has never bothered to complete the audits it started which showed that the current network expenses have been inflated by the inclusion of over $20 billion dollars of missing equipment.</P>
<P>How much do the networks really cost? See our <A href="http://www.newnetworks.com/profitreport2002.htm">report on the Bells' profits</A> <A name=_Hlt35670021></A>and <A href="http://www.teletruth.org/audit.html">about the FCC audits</A> <A name=_Hlt35670060></A><A name=_Hlt35670044></A>. </P>
<P>Let the lawsuits begin.</P>

A transport van travels to each community and a temporary training facility is established by State Library staff in a local venue. The venue is selected by the local public librarian and varies from meeting rooms in the public library to boardrooms to local community halls. The van carries state of the art technology: a wireless network, flat screen monitors and satellite connectivity. A network of 10 computers for hands on training is set up with a presentation projector and a laser printer. The equipment is packed in specially designed crates for transportation.</P><P>Fast access to the Internet in regional Queensland is limited and sporadic. There is no guarantee that venues will have access to the high-speed lines required to deliver training. A mobile satellite dish provides the ideal solution. The 85-cm dish is set up outside each venue and trainers locate the satellite using a spectrum analyser. A local phone line is used to provide the up link to the Internet. A mobile phone has been successfully used as a back-up option.</P><P>State Library staff provide the training sessions which run for two hours and are delivered at times that suit the community. The most popular courses are Introduction to the Internet, Advanced searching skills, and E-mail use. Other courses offered include specialist subjects such as health, law and job seeking. Targeted courses are offered to youth (homework help), seniors, parents, job seekers and seniors. A web site promotes the project and provides details of the schedule, course notes and handouts, photos of training sessions, feedback from participants and milestones.</P><P>The schedule includes larger urban towns (over 70,000) to small outback communities of 300 people. Communities vary from rural, agricultural, mining centres to seaside towns.</P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 align=left border=1><TBODY><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=243><P align=center><I><FONT size=-1>Monto May 20-22, 2002</FONT></I></P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 align=left border=1><TBODY><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=243><P><IMG height=161 src="/spring-2003/raunik2.jpg" width=241></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>The impact of the training is best evaluated by the feedback from the participants who travel long distances to attend multiple sessions: </P><UL type=disc><LI>"I had to travel 200k's (128 miles) a day to attend so I was a bit overloaded by the third day...

<h3 class="title">HFM Interactive &#150; Community Learning in the UK Via Radio and the Internet</h3>

<TABLE width=75 align=left border=1><TBODY><TR><TD><IMG height=178 src="/spring-2003/wortley1.jpg" width=289></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P><A href="http://www.hcln.net/hfm/radioflyer.htm">HFM Interactive&#151;THE Radio Show with Pictures</A> was a 3-week pilot project in the United Kingdom to assess the potential of community radio combined with virtual classroom technology as a tool for community engagement.</P><P>HFM (Harborough FM) is a community radio station operating under a Restricted Service Licence (RSL). The station can broadcast on a specific frequency for a period of one month. RSLs are granted up to a maximum of one every six months. HFM operated their ninth such licence between May 19<SUP>th</SUP> and June 15<SUP>th,</SUP> 2002.</P><P>The main content of the station is music. It is entirely managed and operated by volunteers who raise funds through sponsorship and advertising. HFM has been self-financing since its first broadcast. Its aim is to eventually secure a full time operating licence once the legislation is relaxed to allow this. In order to secure a full time licence, the strategy is to provide an innovative service which might be developed as a model for sustainability. HFM Interactive could provide that model.</P><H3>About HP Virtual Classroom</H3><P>Hewlett Packard has a hosted virtual conferencing service called HPVC (HP Virtual Classroom). This provides an online environment which can be used for a variety of purposes including training and brainstorming. Because HPVC participants can enter this virtual space via a normal web browser, almost any PC compatible computer in the world can be used to join a virtual event.</P><P>Virtual events are hosted or facilitated by a project manager who trains the presenters and organises the visual content shared by the participants. In order to ensure quality of service, the audio for any presentations and interaction is delivered using a separate teleconferencing bridge line. In other words, participants listen on the phone whilst they watch and interact via their PCs.</P><P>For many people who have only one telephone line to use for internet access and phone calls, this is a barrier to participation, and the cost of telephone calls can be prohibitive, especially if they are international. Radio as a mechanism to deliver the audio content is an ideal low cost solution which includes everyone, whether or not they have a computer or telephone.</P><H3>HFM Interactive&#151;THE Radio with Pictures Show</H3><P>HFM Interactive combines the HFM Community Radio with HPVC to enable people in the Harborough District of the East Midlands to listen to a radio chat show with the option of logging on to the web site to view the presentations and interact with the special guests and other members of the audience.</P><P>HFM Interactive developed a series of 15 one hour chat show programs on the theme of the Information Society. The program went out each weekday between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. UK time and involved telephone interviews with special guests around the world as well as local guests in the studio. It aimed to bring the local and global together in a common space to share ideas and interact with each other.</P><P>Over 50 special guests were involved from USA, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and the topics discussed under the general theme of the Information Society included such topics as health, knowledge management, social entrepreneurs, community media, gender, digital divide, sustainability, community publishing tools, and more.</P><P>At the end of each program, the content was archived and could be viewed both within the virtual classroom as a <A href="http://www.hcln.net/hfm">rolling screenshow</A> and as a <A href="http://www.hcln.net/hfm/archives/index.htm">Powerpoint presentation</A> via separate web page.</P><H3>The Lessons Learned</H3><P>The technology worked well and, from anecdotal evidence, the program was well received by a local audience, despite the fact that only a handful of people logged on to the live broadcasts each day. There was a significant amount of access on the <A href="http://www.hcln.net/">website </A>with a daily hit rate in excess of 1000 per day. One of the visible benefits was the interaction between special guests who, although experts within a common field, all had diverse backgrounds and would have been unlikely to meet face to face under normal circumstances. HFM Interactive was successful at facilitating knowledge sharing and relationship building among these guests, who participated from different countries.</P><H3>The Next Step</H3><P>HFM Interactive showed that any village or town anywhere in the world could now host its own international conference with top experts sharing experiences with a local audience.</P><P>Because large parts of the globe are under-served with internet access, but the majority of the globe has access to radio, this concept of developing programs which are both educational and entertaining and suitable for radio transmission, has potential for tackling the Digital Divide in a cost effective and practical way.</P><P>Funding is now being sought to develop this concept further as a global roadshow and research project aimed at building an inclusive Information Society where lifelong learning is accessible to everyone.</P><HR><DIV></DIV><P>David Wortley (<A href="mailto:dwortley@massmitec.co.uk">dwortley@massmitec.co.uk</A>) is owner and founder of Mass Mitec, a Leicestershire based new media consultancy specialising in virtual community/collaboration technologies.

<h3 class="title">The Digital City of Parthenay: Social Networks and Civic Nets</h3>

  <p>The district of Parthenay (17.000 inhabitants) is a good example of a French     wired city. The &quot;Parthenay, ville num&eacute;ris&eacute;e,&quot; project     began in 1994 and actively got underway in 1996. The basic idea was to consider     the Internet, from that moment onwards, as a basic and absolutely necessary     public service that every institution must provide. Parthenay was the first     district to become an Internet Service Provider for the local community (1996),     providing both the connection and technical assistance to the inhabitants.     One third of the inhabitants now regularly use email.</p>  <h3>Merge the Real and the Virtual</h3>  <p>A key element for the spread of the use of new communication forms was the     opening of &quot;espaces num&eacute;ris&eacute;s.&quot;. The team working     on the &quot;Parthenay, ville num&eacute;ris&eacute;e&quot; project set up     some public places where citizens can access and learn about new technologies.     The first public place was opened in 1996. Now there are twelve. Every site     is equipped with networked computers and tools (scanners, printers, etc.).     Every site is targeted (but not exclusively) to a specific issue. For example,     there is an espace num&eacute;ris&eacute;e for small and medium enterprises     for economical purposes; Maisons du Jeux is a place for games and playful     activities; la Maison de la Citoyennet&eacute; Active is a space for associations     and culture; and the town hall for the relationship with the administration.     In every space there are assistants that train and help citizens.</p>  <p>Two other key strategies led Parthenay to become an electronic village should     be noted:</p>  <ul type=disc>    <li>The equipment and the connection of all the schools; </li>    <li>The &quot;1000 micros&quot; promotion under which low cost PCs for 1000       families was provided.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Parthenay: a social project for active citizenship</h3>  <p>In a wired city, implementing the digital tools and the technological infrastructure     represent the last step of a deep political and cultural process. The dynamics     of Parthenay's local development is based upon a social project that has been     promoted by the town hall for more than 20 years. The culture of active citizenship     doesn't consider the diffusion of communication technologies as primary goal,     but uses technologies to improve citizenships and social cohesion.&nbsp; Therefore,     this culture of an &quot;active citizenship,&quot; as the former mayor of     Parthenay Michel Herv&eacute; defined it, is based upon three main elements.</p>  <ul type=disc>    <li>The constant effort to give citizens a sense of responsibility, trust       and relevance.</li>  </ul>  <p>Actually, the citizen lies no longer outside of the decisional process and     the activities of the civitas, but on the contrary they are directly involved     in the social life. Their role is no longer imposed by a heavy representative     hierarchy, but rather by an evaluation of their activities and projects on     an associative level. </p>  <ul type=disc>    <li>A development of the transversality and interdependence of wills and collective       experiences.</li>  </ul>  <p>The active citizenship project is based upon the idea of developing transversal     relationships with new forms of solidarity; in this sense the classical culture     of hierarchy and decision taking processes are upset and under discussion.</p>  <ul type=disc>    <li>A strategic withdrawal by the mayor and the administrative hierarchy;       that from now on play a facilitator role in the definition of the projects       and in implementing them.</li>  </ul>  <p>Within a wired city project, the mayor plays a paradoxical role. On the one     hand he stands aside from an operative role&#151;he becomes a facilitator     and no longer a direct promoter of social activities&#151;yet, on the other     hand in order to achieve this result he must be strongly positive and he must     promote the different projects with energy and persuasion. This shift of power     takes place thanks to an autonomy model that results from a plurality of decision     making centers that tend to emerge within a networked society.</p>  <p>These are just some thoughts about the original development of the Parthenay     digital city.</p>  <p>If the more traditional systems of social representation evolve following     a vertical, consultative, delegation and centralized pyramidal trend, Parthenay     embodies the attempt in developing a horizontal, reticular, decentralized     structure, where the mayor plays a real role of facilitator of the social,     political relations rather than the decision-taking role. Finally, in the     present evolution from traditional villages to electronic village what is     important is that the technological infrastructure to be effective come (as     Parthenay shows) after a long cultural and political evolution.</p>  <hr>  <div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext .75pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>   </div>  <p><a href="mailto:casalegno@mit.edu">Federico Casalegno, Ph.D</a>, is researcher     at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The full version of this     paper <ahref="http://www.mit.edu/~fca/papers/civicnetwork.pdf">From Cybernetics to Cibersociality:     Civic Network and Relational Networks in the Information Era</a> is available     on the Internet. This paper is based upon a research I carried out in <ahref="http://www.district-parthenay.fr/">Parthenay</a> with St&eacute;phane Hugon     and a research team for of the <ahref="http://www.univ-paris5.fr/ceaq/activities/projets.htm">CeaQ - Sorbonne Paris     V University</a>. Thanks to all the researchers and Prof. Michel Maffesoli     that made possible the realization of this work. Michel Herv&eacute;, with     his team, was the real ideological and political founder of the <a href="http://194.250.166.236/villenum1000/espaces/VNespaces.htm">Parthenay     ville num&eacute;ris&eacute;e</a> project. He was mayor of the city from 1978     to March 2001. Since he left, the project changed perspective and directions;     this brings our attention to think to the important role of the charismatic     leader for a wired city project.</p></div>
