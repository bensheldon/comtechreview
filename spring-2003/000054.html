<div class="category_title">The Digital City of Parthenay: Social Networks and Civic Nets</div> <span class="posted">by Federico Casalegno</span>




  <p>The district of Parthenay (17.000 inhabitants) is a good example of a French     wired city. The &quot;Parthenay, ville num&eacute;ris&eacute;e,&quot; project     began in 1994 and actively got underway in 1996. The basic idea was to consider     the Internet, from that moment onwards, as a basic and absolutely necessary     public service that every institution must provide. Parthenay was the first     district to become an Internet Service Provider for the local community (1996),     providing both the connection and technical assistance to the inhabitants.     One third of the inhabitants now regularly use email.</p>  <span class="subhead">Merge the Real and the Virtual</span>  <p>A key element for the spread of the use of new communication forms was the     opening of &quot;espaces num&eacute;ris&eacute;s.&quot;. The team working     on the &quot;Parthenay, ville num&eacute;ris&eacute;e&quot; project set up     some public places where citizens can access and learn about new technologies.     The first public place was opened in 1996. Now there are twelve. Every site     is equipped with networked computers and tools (scanners, printers, etc.).     Every site is targeted (but not exclusively) to a specific issue. For example,     there is an espace num&eacute;ris&eacute;e for small and medium enterprises     for economical purposes; Maisons du Jeux is a place for games and playful     activities; la Maison de la Citoyennet&eacute; Active is a space for associations     and culture; and the town hall for the relationship with the administration.     In every space there are assistants that train and help citizens.</p>  <p>Two other key strategies led Parthenay to become an electronic village should     be noted:</p>  <ul type=disc>    <li>The equipment and the connection of all the schools; </li>    <li>The &quot;1000 micros&quot; promotion under which low cost PCs for 1000       families was provided.</li>  </ul>  <span class="subhead">Parthenay: a social project for active citizenship</span>  <p>In a wired city, implementing the digital tools and the technological infrastructure     represent the last step of a deep political and cultural process. The dynamics     of Parthenay's local development is based upon a social project that has been     promoted by the town hall for more than 20 years. The culture of active citizenship     doesn't consider the diffusion of communication technologies as primary goal,     but uses technologies to improve citizenships and social cohesion.&nbsp; Therefore,     this culture of an &quot;active citizenship,&quot; as the former mayor of     Parthenay Michel Herv&eacute; defined it, is based upon three main elements.</p>  <ul type=disc>    <li>The constant effort to give citizens a sense of responsibility, trust       and relevance.</li>  </ul>  <p>Actually, the citizen lies no longer outside of the decisional process and     the activities of the civitas, but on the contrary they are directly involved     in the social life. Their role is no longer imposed by a heavy representative     hierarchy, but rather by an evaluation of their activities and projects on     an associative level. </p>  <ul type=disc>    <li>A development of the transversality and interdependence of wills and collective       experiences.</li>  </ul>  <p>The active citizenship project is based upon the idea of developing transversal     relationships with new forms of solidarity; in this sense the classical culture     of hierarchy and decision taking processes are upset and under discussion.</p>  <ul type=disc>    <li>A strategic withdrawal by the mayor and the administrative hierarchy;       that from now on play a facilitator role in the definition of the projects       and in implementing them.</li>  </ul>  <p>Within a wired city project, the mayor plays a paradoxical role. On the one     hand he stands aside from an operative role&#151;he becomes a facilitator     and no longer a direct promoter of social activities&#151;yet, on the other     hand in order to achieve this result he must be strongly positive and he must     promote the different projects with energy and persuasion. This shift of power     takes place thanks to an autonomy model that results from a plurality of decision     making centers that tend to emerge within a networked society.</p>  <p>These are just some thoughts about the original development of the Parthenay     digital city.</p>  <p>If the more traditional systems of social representation evolve following     a vertical, consultative, delegation and centralized pyramidal trend, Parthenay     embodies the attempt in developing a horizontal, reticular, decentralized     structure, where the mayor plays a real role of facilitator of the social,     political relations rather than the decision-taking role. Finally, in the     present evolution from traditional villages to electronic village what is     important is that the technological infrastructure to be effective come (as     Parthenay shows) after a long cultural and political evolution.</p>  <hr>  <div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext .75pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>   </div>  <p><div class="bionote"><a href="mailto:casalegno@mit.edu">Federico Casalegno, Ph.D</a>, is researcher     at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Thanks to all the researchers and Prof. Michel Maffesoli     that made possible the realization of this work. Michel Herv&eacute;, with     his team, was the real ideological and political founder of the <a href="http://194.250.166.236/villenum1000/espaces/VNespaces.htm">Parthenay     ville num&eacute;ris&eacute;e</a> project. He was mayor of the city from 1978     to March 2001. Since he left, the project changed perspective and directions;     this brings our attention to think to the important role of the charismatic     leader for a wired city project.</div></p>
