      <![CDATA[<P><BR>With this spring issue, coming out so shortly after our winter offering, we're excited to be on a roll, with a new on-line, print on-demand format we're experimenting with, articles that intersect with our other involvements and work, including a new cable television/webcast experiment, new features we're planning to have as regular offerings including graphics by Matt Wuerker and a policy column by Robert Cannon, Director of the <A href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/">Washington Internet Project</A>&#151;and lots of new content and special pieces that we're excited about, following on the heels of our reader survey that drew overwhelming responses from you.</P>
<P>This issue's cover memorial to Toni Stone, founder of CTCNet, and the articles on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program, by Gabrielle Hammond, and on the Commonwealth Broadband Network supplement the <A href="http://www.cbcmedia.net/">premiere cable and web cast</A> of "First Tuesday"&#151;providing integrated on-request streaming video coverage and demonstrate, we think, a truly multi-media breakthrough.&nbsp; With issues like EITC, we need to present these stories in as many ways as possible. This important benefit program for low-income people has literally billions of dollars going unclaimed because 25% of those eligible still do not know about the program or how to file for benefits. The growing technology resources that are helping people obtain these benefits is a major story and development that needs to be told far and wide.</P>
<P>As the organizational publication for <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet</A> and <A href="http://www.afcn.org/">AFCN</A>, we have a special relation with their leadership and programs and in providing you with coverage of some of their major organization developments&#151;we trust their pieces encourage you to visit both organizational web sites for an even more up-to-date look at their resources. Two of our VISTA reports&#151;by Sharon Alhourani and Mary Grybeck&#151;are from members of the CTC VISTA Project. Continuing contributions by The Children's Partnership, Anne McFarland, Daniel Schackman (another CTC VISTA), Layton Olson, Frank Odasz, Randal Pinkett, and Terry Grunwald, plus a host of new contributors give this issue both a continuity and coverage of new projects and programs and alert us to new developments taking place during this period of consolidation.</P>
<P>We were pleased to have nearly 170 responses to our online survey in January. The survey results gave us a clearer idea of the makeup, needs, and interest of our audience: </P>
<DIV></DIV>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>54% of respondents had been reading the <I>Review</I> for less than a year.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>Most respondents access and prefer the online version.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>76% expressed an interest in getting Special Reports and Publications.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>Respondents fell into every work venue, including CTCs, other nonprofits, the public sector, schools and universities, for-profit enterprise, consulting, etc.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>Many people offered topics and suggestions for future issues.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>We've since received articles from people who made inquiries through the survey form.</DIV></LI></UL>
<DIV class=Section1>
<P>It's been a successful evaluation, and we look forward to considering your recommendations further as the <I>Review</I> continues to develop and change, along with the community technology field itself.&nbsp; We're working on contributions for the next issue now, so if you've got something you'd like to submit for consideration, do let us know.&#151;<I>pm, rc, &amp; md</I></P></DIV>]]>

      <![CDATA[<P>Community media and technology programming, integrating multi-site videoconferencing, simultaneously cablecast over community cable access stations throughout eastern Massachusetts and web cast everywhere the Internet is available, with live-time chat and available as video-on-demand—many of the dynamic features of Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative programs were developed over the preceding two years and reported upon by Reebee Garofalo in his winter '02 article on <A href="http://www.comtechreview.org/winter-spring-2002/000061.html">"The Greater Boston Broadband Network (GBBN): An Innovative University-Community Partnership."</A> Coalition partner organizations have been developing this state-of-the-art model since the inception of the CTC VISTA Project in the fall of '00, in part as an educational opportunity for their VISTAs.</P>

<P>When the GBBN transformed itself on the cusp of the new year, emerging from intense in-person and online conversations and planning discussions, reborn as the Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative (<A href="http://www.cbcmedia.net/">www.cbcmedia.net</A>), there was new energy and direction in the quantum leap that such a change suggests. And that change is most concretely seen in the development of a pilot monthly television and web cast show, building upon the kind of programsming developed earlier with Alan Shaw (on Technical Literacy, Civic Engagement and Social Empowerment), Charlotte Ryan (on media literacy—Drive-by Shooting: Race and Class in Mainstream News), George Stoney and Toni Stone (on the Origins of the Community Cable Access and Technology Centers Movements), and available in the <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/cbcmedia/archives.htm">CBC archives</A>.</P>
<P>"First Tuesday," in contrast with the more traditional academic didacticism of the earlier productions, is more dynamic, fast-faced, entertaining in style. With hosts Steve Provizer and Nettrice Gaskins introducing segments separated by a music and graphic multi-media opening, closing, and PSA roll-ins and transitions, the CBC is establishing a radically new kind of public space that extends well beyond the single community cable access station show on which it builds.  The February 4<SUP>th</SUP> premiere featured The CBC has begun distributing other locally-produced affiliated programs on other Tuesdays; March 18<SUP>th</SUP> premiered the first "Other Tuesday" program, a show initially cablecast on Cambridge Community TV on <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/cbcmedia/grassroots.htm">"The Internet and Grassroots Democracy."</A></P>
<P>In February the project was highlighted as one of the new innovations in broadband applications development, being featured at the <A href="http://www.apt.org/confer/2003bbforum.html">Broadband Forum</A> hosted by the Alliance for Public Technology at the Washington Press Club on February 21st and <A href="http://www.benton.org/Library/broadband/broadband-world.html">highlighted in their joint report with the Benton Foundation</A> on broadband development.</P>
<P>With lots of initial volunteer/donated time, talent, expertise, and effort and a budget of approximately $500 per show, CBC is in the midst of facing a series of challenges and opportunities for this kind of project that is sure to grow—developing production team coordination and cohesion; guidelines and procedures for "other Tuesday" programming, growing participation and membership; technical specifications and network infrastructure; fundraising proposals.  Stay tuned.</P>

<P>The Board of Directors of CTCNet is pleased to announce the selection of Kavita Singh as Executive Director, beginning this March in the Cambridge office. Kavita brings a wealth of experience in the community technology field, most recently as Director of Programs at the <A href="http://www.publiceducation.org/about/oakland2.htm">Marcus A. Foster Educational Institute</A> in Oakland, CA. From 2001 to the present, she developed and managed grant and service programs for Oakland Public school communities. Among those programs was the <A href="http://www.otxwest.org/">Oakland Technology Exchange-West</A> (OTX-West), a local CTC that in two years provided more than 4,000 computers to Oakland schools and homes. Kavita is also familiar to some of our members, having served as a part-time Project Coordinator for CTCNet, covering three U.S. Dept. of Education regions in 2001-2002.</P><P>Prior to her current experience, Kavita was a Project Manager at the <A href="http://www.newdeal.org/">NewDeal Foundation</A> in Somerville, MA, where she constructed and managed a grant process that donated software to over 75 community agencies and developed a three-day computer training institute for 25 community members at Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Harlem, MT.</P><TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=256 align=right border=1><TBODY><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=252><IMG height=212 src="/spring-2003/img/reese.jpg" width=251 align=right alt="Erroll Reese"></TD></TR><TR><TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=252><DIV align=center><span class="caption">Erroll Reese is President of the Board of Directors for CTCNet</span></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>From 1997-2000, Kavita directed two professional development programs providing support to more than 40 New York City public schools and community organizations as a Program Officer for <A href="http://www.newvisions.org/">New Visions for Public Schools</A>. For <A href="http://www.publiceducation.org/projectfirst/">Project First</A>, she annually recruited and supervised 10-15 AmeriCorps Members to provide school-based technical training and support to teachers, parents, and students. For the Service Learning Project, she managed professional development for nine teachers through seminars, on-site consultants, and an annual conference to strengthen connections between student community service experiences and academic goals. From 1993-1996, she was a Computer Interface Designer with Computer Sciences Corporation in New Jersey. Kavita has also done extensive community work, including tutoring, mentoring, computer and Internet training, and volunteer management. Kavita has a B.S. in Computer Information Systems from Drexel University and a Master of Education with a concentration in Technology in Education from Harvard University.</P><P>CTCNet is looking forward to working with Kavita in this exciting time of growth for the organization and the field of community technology. "I'm truly honored and excited to be closely involved with CTCNet again," says Singh. "Our centers and programs use technology in so many different ways that engage and enable us to do what is really at the core of community technology. This core includes literacy, workforce development, access to tools and information, second language acquisition, youth leadership, and numerous other educational and assistive services that help people and communities grow.</P><P>"I look forward to working with the board and staff to continue the network's growth and educate the public about the remarkable work that goes on at each of our centers."</P><HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>

Ben Cain relocated from Cambridge, MA to open the San Francisco office, currently subletting from CompuMentor, Ellen Garza opened the Chicago office, and Anne Neville Davis opened the San Diego office, housed by the <A href="http://www.pangeafoundation.org/">Pangea Foundation</A>.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>In September, Executive Director, Karen Chandler tendered her resignation from CTCNet, effective at the end of the year. Since that time, a Transition Committee from the Board of Directors, and including Stephen Ronan, Managing Director, has managed the search for a new Executive Director.&nbsp; An original pool of 60+ applicants was narrowed down to the 12 and then four, who came to Boston for in-person interviews. In January 2003, Kavita Singh accepted the post. </DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>In November, CTCNet published "From Policy to Action: Profiles of Washington Area Programs Making Progress on the Digital Divide"for&nbsp;the Washington Metropolitan Council of Governments. The report was presented at the Council's annual meeting. See below for a summary of this report.</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>In December, CTCNet released its <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/consortiadirectory/">Regional Consortia Directory</A>, a first-ever guide to community technology networks around the country.</DIV></LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><H3>CTCNet Toolkit V 1.0 Arrives!</H3><P>Thanks to the work of consultant Paul Pitcher, along with the CTCNet staff, the revised <A href="http://www2.ctcnet.org/ctc/toolkit/main.html">Toolkit is now available online</A>.</P><P>The toolkit was created to share resources that can be used by CTCs getting started as well as those organizations that have long-established centers. The includes such resources as sample budget forms, policy documents, intake and evaluation procedures, technology plans, and curriculum materials, just to name a few.We see this is a continuing work-in-progress, so please let us know what you think of it, and if you have additional content to add.</P><H3>CTCNet Completes ACC Regional Development Project </H3><P>The America Connects Consortium has concluded a two-year project administered through CTCNet, to document and support the work of regional networks of CTCs and other organizations aiming to eliminate the digital divide.&nbsp; By bringing together these community technology leaders, the intention is to create added value to the work that each individual organization is doing by mutual support, resource sharing, fundraising, and a focus on regional interests.&nbsp; </P><P>One component of the regional development portion of ACC is the seed-funding grants. In early 2002, CTCNet selected 10 consortia to support at a critical stage of their development. Grants of $2,000 were provided to each of these networks. In some cases, the $2,000 meant the difference between getting off the ground and remaining in the idea-phase of a network. Examples of projects undertaken with the seed grant included securing an AmeriCorps*VISTA member through the CTC VISTA Project as a full-time regional coordinator and conducting the first-ever needs assessments of CTCs in a given area.</P><P>In all cases of the regional consortia, the impetus for development comes from the field. The activity and leadership is present and striving to institutionalize the network in some way. CTCNet aims to facilitate this growth while allowing specific objectives and project work to be defined by the regional network.</P><P>Though there are differences in the history of the development of each of these networks, almost all of the ten grantees are non-incorporated networks and collaboratives, rather than structured 501(c)3 organizations. The benefits of collaboration among those in the field doing the work in specific communities, without the strictures of a new level of bureaucracy, are strong and have great promise for building the field. That being said, there are some challenges that all of these regional networks share in the development phase that need to be addressed in order for them to run smoothly and maximize their potential.</P><P><B><I>Major challenges include:</I></B></P><P><B>Financial Resources:</B> Funding for the work of the networks, tapping into regional funding opportunities without detracting from individual funding for organizations.</P><P><B>Human Resources:</B> Staff to do the work of the networks. Right now most of these networks are operating with volunteers and VISTA members, with leadership provided by key members of the community technology field in their regions both individually (for example, as unpaid Executive Directors) and collectively (for example, as Steering Committees).&nbsp; </P><P>Another issue in that regard is the availability of people to do this work on top of their full-time job responsibilities.</P><P><B>Organizational Structure: </B>Defining a structure that can support the work that needs to be done and that provides continuity, sustainability, institutional memory, and the ability to create long-term goals.</P><P><B>Outreach: </B>Making sure that the networks include a critical mass of community technology and digital empowerment organizations in their respective regions, so that their knowledge base is being drawn upon for the benefit of all, and that they in turn can benefit from access to and participation in the regional networks.</P><P><B>Collaboration with other regional and national groups:</B> To draw on the strengths of these groups and not duplicate services.</P><P><B>Setting up regional work:</B> Some of the networks cover vast regions that require a commitment of time and money to bring members together in a central location.</P><P>It appears that these networks are well aware of these challenges and are planning strategically to meet them, either through steering committees or outside consultants.</P><P>The profiles document the regional consortia as they existed at the end of the seed funding program (September 2002). Each network was asked to capture its work in categories reflecting all aspects of the consortia, such as: Mission/Goals, Stage of Development Funding, Project Work and Impact, and Membership.</P><P>For more information, see <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/accregdev2002.htm">the full report</A>.</P><H3>Digital Empowerment in the Washington, DC Area</H3><P>In December 2002, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) commissioned a report by the Washington, DC office of CTCNet. The report, entitled <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/frompolicytoaction_v1.pdf">"From Policy to Action: Profiles of Washington Area Programs Making Progress on the Digital Divide,"</A>seeks to identify and profile model programs and services in the Washington, DC area whose policies and actions attest to an effort to eliminate the gap that exists between our nation's technology users and non-users. In November 2000, COG had established a Digital Divide Task Force to examine technology issues in the Washington metropolitan region. The CTCNet report is a major component of that work. "Our 'From Policy to Action' report is a testament to the amazing wealth of programs in DC, Maryland and Virginia that provide our communities with access to technology tools, content and skills," says John Zoltner, editor of the Report and Director of CTCNet's DC Office.</P><P><B>Best Practices</B></P><P>The report features organizations that, on the whole, demonstrate the degree to which the metropolitan Washington area is working to eliminate the digital divide for residents in recent years. For example, the District of Columbia Public Library provides more than 225 computers for public use, free of charge, and offers a customer training program. Fairfax County Public Schools enable an ethnically and economically diverse population of Kindergarten-6th Graders to have access to the computer lab as part of the regular curriculum and after-school programs. And in business, Community IT Innovators (CITI) and Confluence Corporation provide technology consulting to nonprofit organizations in the DC Metro area, as well as technology planning and assessment, Web development, software and network design, implementation and support.</P><P><B>Recommendations</B></P><P>Significant barriers still exist to achieving universal access for individuals and communities and eliminating the digital divide. In response, CTCNet interviewed a wide spectrum of influential people and organizations, analyzed statistics from the past decade, reviewed national reports on the topic and studied successful programs throughout the country. Through these exercises, CTCNet developed 12 recommendations for organizational change, which fall within three key areas:</P><P>1) Leveraging Relationships for Fundraising and Support</P></DIV><BLOCKQUOTE><P class=Section1>a. Require cable operator investment in local digital empowerment programs<BR>b. Make media mergers work for communities<BR>c.

<P>Community Technology projects are under fire. Money is tight in a downturned economy; support for public interest work is increasingly difficult to find. Why should elected officials spend scarce money today to build lives and offer opportunity? They may well be retired by the time those people show up in hospitals and prisons.</P>
<P>Okay, that's vented. Now what do we do with the situation we actually face?</P>
<P>Community technology leaders have always dealt with inadequate resources for overwhelming needs. AFCN urges: don't buy into gloomy predictions of a dark future for community technology. Community technology leaders have always dealt with inadequate resources for overwhelming needs. If we work together, this year of crisis can bring more benefits than burdens.</P>
<P>At AFCN, we are feverishly addressing sustainability as one key issue, largely because so many CNs are facing vital deadlines for operations and payrolls. Fortunately some solid questions and promising initiatives are beginning to emerge. One fairly obvious example:</P>
<H3>Community Technology Integration: Centers, Networks, and... Commissions?</H3>
<P>All too often our projects become insular. Daily problems seem so pressing we don't have time to stay in touch with valuable allies, even in our own community. That has to change. AFCN recommends strongly CTC and CN leaders find time to meet with other local technology stakeholders. Perhaps monthly breakfasts? However you gather, invite ISPs, government leaders, economic developers, businesspeople, IT professionals... anyone with an interest in healthy growth of local telecommunications.</P>
<P>If a more formal structure appeals, help create a regional telecom advocacy organization. One good model is a 501c3 "commission," endorsed but not owned by your government(s).</P>
<P>Each "partner" group can retain its own identity and leadership in this collaboration. But together we can exchange information, share resources, and seek additional support.</P>
<P>I recognize collaborative efforts are hardly news for you. So if you have one already, support and energize it. If not, start one. The time has come to get serious about local control and activism.</P>
<P>Whatever you do, MEET! Get the mayor there. Ask bankers. Don't overlook service organizations. The work you do and capacity you help build matters to everyone.</P>
<P>Related questions:</P>
<UL style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<LI>Do you have both a CN and CTCs in your town? What's the difference? 
<LI>Is supporting separate programs becoming a burden? Could you serve better by closer cooperation or even merger?</LI></UL>
<P>Though autonomy, control and separate history are not always compatible it's usually worth the effort to explore sharing operations and facilities. Might help keep the doors open.</P>
<H3>Affordable, Accessible Software, Tools </H3>
<P>Two other current priorities for AFCN support of community technology leaders are basic: tools and training. We're preparing a report on powerful tools already available and usually free. Some overworked CN leaders may not yet know where to find assistance they may badly need. For example, have you noted the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/accregdev2002.htm">ACC Regional Development 2002 Report</A> and the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/consortiadirectory/index.html">Regional Consortia Directory</A> recently posted on the CTCNet website? Or the <a href="http://www.americaconnects.net/toolkit">self-evaluation toolkit</A> on AmericaConnects.net? You don't have to be a CTC; anyone can use these tools.</P>

<TD height=50>
<DIV align=center>
<P><span class="caption">Gene Takes a Call<BR>From the Home Office</span></P></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Another increasingly timely resource is the growing selection and sophistication of "Open Source/shareware/accessible/whatever" software. (Richard Stallman was just visiting, decrying the more common name "Open Source" &#150; but you know what I mean). Andrew Cohill and others have long recognized their value, and they're right. Flexibility and cost make these important options for efficiently-managed community technology projects. (For years MAIN/TCRC has been running Linux on some servers in our NOC, but since we are an R&D facility for community IT we expect and even presume high maintenance. So I hadn't realized how far open source has evolved. Now we have a local Open Source Forum to exchange information and advocate continuing development.)</P>
<P>If you are interested in more information on Open Source, and/or would like to volunteer to help in its development, please make contact via the <a href="http://www.afcn.org/comments.html">AFCN.org website</A>.</P>
<H3>Funding, Training</H3>
<P>In the last issue I discussed our new professional Community Network <a href="/fall-02_winter-03/000150.html">training programs</A>. For this issue I'll remind that we are responding to the lamentable reductions in federal government support for key community telecommunications programs like CTC, America Connects, NTIA/TOP, VISTA digital divide initiates, etc. State governments are cutting back as well. In Texas we currently have nearly 200 community networks, mostly funded by one program, now almost certainly being eliminated. I sadly predict we'll lose a number of them during the year ahead.</P>
<P>That's why we're pushing to identify support resources still available and working to assist CN leaders in participating in programs that fit their needs. The most recent example is our March 27, 2003 TOP grant workshop. TOP officials, whose outreach budgets are terribly slim, were wonderful about partnering with us to help inform prospective applicants about the 2003 RFP.</P>
<P>We're hurriedly working toward a second workshop like this, to be held in the DC area. Workshop information is posted on the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/conferenceworkshops/whoswhere.htm">TOP workshop web page</A> and on AFCN and CTCNet member lists. For information on this and other funding assistance programs, you can also contact Patti Clifford (<a href="mailto:pclifford@main.org">pclifford@main.org</A>).</P>
<H3>We Need Leaders!</H3>
<P>Are you willing to help out (and help your own efforts, too) by working with AFCN to gather information and develop resources? One immediate need is experienced "volunteer program" leaders able to coordinate basic online volunteerism. Please let us know if you can help. </P>
<P>New Mexico Milestone: Judith Pepper, member of the AFCN Board of Directors, reports the world-famed <a href="http://www.laplaza.org/">La Plaza Community Network</A> of Taos, New Mexico, is winding down operations. Judith and the La Plaza leadership decided the primary goals for which La Plaza was created have been met and, given increasing difficulty of economic sustainability, their time and efforts could be more productive in other activities.</P>
<P>Though this passage naturally brings some sadness, La Plaza will be recorded as one of community networking's clear successes. Plus there is the brighter news that Judith will be sharing her expertise and insights professionally, as a consultant for other communities.</P>
<P>This brings a question I'd like to ask AFCN members. As our profession matures we are blessed by a growing number of true experts, capable of assisting communities everywhere. When Steve Snow left Charlotte's Web and Andrew Cohill left Blacksburg Electronic Village, we added two assets to the small cadre of skilled consultants, like the legendary Frank Odasz.</P>
<P>And I can't mention them without noting other friends who are also genuine experts, like Terri and Karen and Richard and... see the problem?</P>
<P>So <EM>The</EM> Question: Would it be valuable for AFCN to create some sort of directory of qualified community network advisors? Your input is invited.</P>
<H3>Finally... Remembering Don Furth</H3>

<P>I'm sad to report a loss in our family. On February 27th, 2003, Don Furth of Rio Grande FreeNet passed away. Though not so widely known as our beloved Toni Stone, Don was one of the true pioneers of community networking in this country.</P>
<P>Upon retiring as a U.S. Army Ranger Sergeant Major with Purple Heart and Bronze Star, Don recognized great human need in the vast, economically struggling, geographically-isolated area surrounding El Paso, Texas (El Paso, in a different time zone from the rest of Texas, is closer to Los Angeles than to its own state capital.) So he founded the <a href="http://rgfn.epcc.edu/">Rio Grande FreeNet</A>, the first FreeNet in Texas, to offer access, education, and opportunity to hundreds of thousands in his community. </P>
<P>An unassuming but dedicated man, Don Furth embodied the best of our profession. He worked devotedly for this wonderful project until the day he passed away. His decency and commitment were truly an inspiration to those blessed by his friendship. This is not mere eulogy: Don was always there for us, offering quiet guidance and spiritual support, with his trademark warmth, wit, and wisdom. He will be greatly missed.</P>
<P>That's about it for this issue, except to say again: These are times we need each other more than ever. Please tell us how AFCN can best serve you and your community. And please join AFCN to help us make that happen. Thanks, Gene</P>

      <![CDATA[<P>On the heels of welfare reform, putting money back into the pockets of our client community is a priority. And, while most low-income families would not turn away a check for $4,140, many unknowingly do just that by being unaware of the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit.</P>
<P>Referred to as EITC or EIC, the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit is a $31 billion program. It can return as much as $4,140 a year to a low-income working family, which dramatically impacts the lives of our clients. The average return is about $1,600. EITC is a credit. This means it returns more money to the low-wage earner than they put in through taxes withheld. To get it, a person simply needs to file their Federal tax return and the Earned Income Credit worksheet. It is important to note that low-income earners who did not claim the EIC in years past are entitled to file or amend prior returns for up to three years, and receive retroactive EIC. This potentially enables low-income tax filers to receive up to $12,000 at one time, assuming they have never filed for this credit and were eligible for it for each of the last three years.</P>
<P>For those who do claim this credit, the benefits extend far beyond one individual or one family. Statistics show that 80% of the income credit refunded to the family is spent within the community in which the low-income family lives. Generally, the money is spent on rent, utilities, and food and household products from community-based stores. Despite the potential windfall promised by the Federal EIC for communities and low-income families, billions of dollars are uncollected annually by eligible families and individuals. Many individuals do not file because they do not know about the credit. Many who do file often fall victim to high-priced "Refund Anticipation Loans" (RALs), commonly offered by most commercial tax preparation offices. While these loans speed an advanced payment to a worker by a few weeks (for workers who do not electronically file), the annual percentage rate on the advanced refund ranges from 100% to 700%. Persons who affirmatively answer the question, "Would you like your money right away?" unknowingly lose badly-needed funds.</P>
<H3><A href="http://www.icanefile.org/front/lang.aspx">Introducing I-CAN! Earned Income Credit (I-CAN! EIC)</A><BR></H3>
<P>I-CAN! EIC is a web-based application that helps low-wage earners file and complete their Federal tax forms for free. It has been created with funding by the Legal Services Corporation and is certified by the IRS as an online tax tool. It completes Federal tax forms for anyone eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit and allows users the option to electronically file their return. I-CAN! EIC also does the California state returns for users, when appropriate. A user does not have to look at tax forms or know before beginning if they can claim the EITC.</P>
<H3>How I-CAN! EIC Works</H3>
<P>It's easy: <A href="http://www.icanefile.org/">www.icanefile.org</A>!<BR>I-CAN! EIC is offered in Spanish, Vietnamese, and English. It uses a video guide to read simple questions that are on the screen to the user. The application has been translated at a fifth grade literacy level. The client answers the questions using a keyboard, at their own pace. When all of the questions are answered, completed tax forms are available for printing and electronic filing. If someone is not eligible for the Federal EIC, the I-CAN! EIC system will "exit" a user and link them to a site that tells them the volunteer tax preparation site nearest them.</P>
<H3>A National Network</H3>
<P>While I-CAN! EIC is a great web tool for our client community, its success will be rooted in the partnerships created around the country with programs that promote the service to its clients. To date, the I-CAN! EIC network involves <A href="http://www.icanefile.org/reglist/NewRegistrant7.asp">55 programs across 19 states</A>. Each program reaches hundreds or thousands of clients who could benefit from this credit. Partnering programs have committed at various levels: Some programs are putting the link to the web application on their site. Others are engaging in outreach and publicity campaigns about the EIC in their community and promoting I-CAN! EIC. A majority of programs are offering a computer workstation in their offices for clients to come in and access the system. A few programs are integrating I-CAN! EIC within their own client delivery systems by putting messages for clients to hear about I-CAN! EIC on their telephones while the client is on hold. Additionally, they are training their staff to route clients to the system even though the staff may be helping them with another social or legal matter.</P>
<P>This is the first national network created on behalf of low-income clients to help them put money back into their pockets. To support the national network, the Legal Aid Society of Orange County has developed trainings for programs to attend, which are offered "virtually" via web conferencing and are an hour and a half in length. Additionally, we have put together professionally-made Public Service Announcements (PSAs) that we send to each partner for them to use on their own radio and television stations. Each PSA has a spot where the program's name and number is advertised for more help. The spots inform clients in an easy way about the EITC, e-filing, and the I-CAN! EIC program.</P>
<H3>How to Partner</H3>
<P>To partner, a program leader can contact Gabrielle Hammond (see below). Alternately, a program can go online and register themselves as a partner. They will then receive additional information on trainings and a Memorandum of Understanding that needs to be signed. More information about the project can be found at <A href="http://www.icanefile.org/programs">www.icanefile.org/programs</A>.

<P><EM></EM><EM>This article is part two of a three-part series that shares case studies from the Creating Community Connections Project, an ongoing effort at </EM><A href="http://www.camfieldestates.net/"><EM>Camfield Esta</EM></A><A href="http://www.camfieldestates.net/"><EM>tes</EM></A><EM>, a predominantly African-American, low- to moderate-income housing development in Roxbury, MA, since 1999. As part of this project, MIT researchers have worked with residents to establish a technological infrastructure by offering every family a new computer, software, and high-speed Internet connection, along with comprehensive course and a web-based community building system. The project combines these elements in an effort to achieve a social and cultural resonance that integrates both community technology and community building by leveraging indigenous assets.</EM></P>
<P><EM>The first article in this series, </EM><A href="/fall-02_winter-03/000113.html"><EM>"Edna Jackson, Technology and Community Building: From Staunchest Opponent to Greatest Proponent."</EM></A><EM> a senior citizen and survivor of emphysema, and demonstrated the positive influence a community can exert on its members. This second installment portrays the experiences of the resident project leader Rodney Williams, a college student, and his evolution throughout the initiative, his involvement as an active agent of change, the social and cultural shift to becoming an active producer of information and content, and the benefits that are accrued.</EM></P>
<P>Rodney Williams joined the Creating Community Connections project team along with two residents (a brother-sister pair) and his younger cousin, whom he personally recruited to join the team. The remaining team members included representatives from the Tenants' Association and the Housing Finance Agency and researchers from MIT. Given his longstanding ties in the neighborhood and his prior experience with community-based projects (he successfully raised money to organize a local lacrosse program for urban youth), the team easily reached consensus that Rodney should be assigned the role of project leader.</P>
<P>Under Rodney's leadership, the project team was involved in a variety of activities throughout the summer of 2000. The team's primary responsibilities were to design and administer a preliminary assessment survey, organize an awareness campaign to solicit resident participation in the project, coordinate an asset-mapping initiative of local community resources (e.g., organizations, institutions such as libraries, schools, churches, businesses, etc.), and determine the user interface and functionality for the housing development website. To manage these tasks, team meetings were held once a week (at minimum) on-site at the development or on campus at MIT. A typical meeting included written and oral reports from each team member, project updates, strategy sessions, and weekly reading assignments and discussion.</P>
<P>Indubitably, the active participation of residents in each of these assignments was integral to the project's successful launch. For Rodney, the interviews provided a natural mechanism to converse with neighbors and simultaneously learn about community issues.</P>
<P>Being involved in the interviews was very important to me because it gave me a chance to get up close and personal with the residents and talk to them on a more initiate basis – more so than just the casual conversation that I normally have with some of them. I feel like I learned just as much from the survey and the survey results as I did from the off-the-record conversations that I had with the residents.</P>
<P>The asset-mapping initiative also generated numerous benefits. First, residents were able to identify local resources of potential benefit to themselves and their neighbors. This included child care facilities, youth-serving organizations, nearby businesses, etc., that would later be available on the housing development's website. Second, the information that was gathered provided an environmental scan of organizations with whom future partnerships could be forged, pending the results of the preliminary assessment. Third, and finally, the process itself heightened residents' appreciation of the assets located in their community.</P>
<P><I>I think it was important for [residents] to go out and find that information ourselves because that, in itself, was an exercise in community building. We are the ones that live here and this is going to benefit us and these are things that we should know – It was really empowering to see all of the things that were in the community.</I></P>
<P>Rodney's participation, as well as the participation of the other resident team members, appears to have had a positive impact on the project and each of them personally. Above all, their participation deepened their own levels of engagements as well as that of their neighbors.</P>

<P>As the fall was ushered in, the project moved from planning to implementation as Rodney and the other team members began to witness the fruits of their labor. The first cohort of families involved with the project (Round I) were interviewed in August 2000 and began taking courses at the community technology center (CTC) on the premises one month later. Rodney would periodically check-in on their progress as the team waived his participation in the courses because of his prior experience with computers and his contributions to the project to-date. The Round I participants would receive their computers and Internet connections just prior to the Thanksgiving holiday (the process of interviews and courses ramped up again in January 2001 for a second cohort of families during Round II).</P>
<P>In December 2000, the housing development's website went "live" as residents who completed the program were able to access the system online. For nine months after the system's launch, Rodney was noticeably absent as a contributor to the site he helped to design and implement. This was partly due to his busy schedule. However, there were other reasons to explain why his online participation lagged behind offline leadership. He was hesitant to contribute until others contributed, while others were reluctant to do so for exactly the same reason.</P>
<P><I>I thought, OK now we have this site up and initially I was thinking, "Why aren't people really communicating on there?" and "Why aren't people using it as much as they should?" but I don't know if I necessarily saw myself as one of those people. And then I thought to myself, "Well why aren't you contributing?" For some reason there was a disconnect.</I></P>
<P>Interestingly, one factor that accelerated Rodney's transition in this regard was his fundamental belief in the value of producing information and content in the digital age. Although his initial conceptualization of such activities was centered on global, rather than local contributions, the project has shaped and molded his thinking.</P>
<P><I>To really leave your mark and make your contribution you have to be able to produce and create something using that tool whether that is creating a website or contributing a line [or] a message on a chat room or a message board or whatever it is.</I></P>
<P><I>On a personal note, that's the only way I can feel validated. I have to feel like I use something as a means to get me to another point where I can produce something from it. I'm at a point where I want to make my contribution, and I've got a lot of different ideas that I'm working on now.</I></P>
<H3>From Passive to Active</H3>
<P>Presently, Rodney is spearheading a number of initiatives that are heavily informed by the results of the preliminary assessment, which identified issues such as a lack of activities for youth, and the need for improved community information and communication, safety/security measures, and employment opportunities for residents.</P>
<P>The shift that has taken place within Rodney is one that has involved varying degrees of "active-ness" at varying times along varying dimensions. Since the project's inception, he has been integrally involved in the process of building community at the development. On one hand, his ongoing participation in the interviews, recruiting, asset-mapping, website design, and other activities, have been key to the project's success. Furthermore, his participation and contributions to the virtual space at the development are now beginning to come to fruition.</P>
<P>Some of the online and offline activities he is involved with include a discussion forum for "Tenants Association Notices and Announcements" on the housing development's website; a forum created by the President of the Tenants' Association, after a meeting with Rodney; a partnership with the Boston Empowerment Zone to conduct job training and placement for residents that may be partially mediated online; and the return of the housing development's newsletter that was regularly distributed prior to renovation. Rodney will help design the newsletter in a paper-based and electronic format by working with the President of the Tenants' Association, the Director of Community Relations, and others.</P>
<P>Lastly, Rodney believes the project has benefited him as much personally as it has benefited the community. He feels he has a repertoire of positive, memorable experiences when his hard work and dedication have truly paid off.</P>
<P><I>I feel like participating in the project has made me a lot more connected with the community. A lot of that has to do with me having such a hands-on role in a lot of the interviews, the data gathering, the recruiting participants and so forth. It's made me more visible in the community. People are pretty willing to talk to me and have a conversation with them. I feel like just being in the project has definitely brought me a lot closer to people here and the community. I feel like I'm a trusted and respected figure.</I></P>
<P>Clearly, as a result of his active role in the project, Rodney feels more connected to the community than ever before.</P>

The <A href="http://oncampus.richmond.edu/connect/geninfo/campuspartnership.html">Campus Community Partnership of Metro Richmond</A> posed this question to community leaders. What they said is now changing the way local nonprofits work together. Together, academics and citizens developed <A href="http://www.connectrichmond.org/">ConnectRichmond.org</A>, a dynamic local nonprofit network and a website aimed at using information and technology to build the capacity of the local independent sector.</P><P>Decision-making in the last 20 years in Richmond, Virginia's conservative capital city, has been dominated by politics&#151;especially the politics of race and business interests. As in most of the country during this same time, the local nonprofit sector grew tremendously, yet still had no consistent voice in policy debates. Instead, it focused almost exclusively on the day-to-day challenges of critical need, a reality that forfeited the broader solutions offered through public policy.</P>

<P>Seeing the potential for facilitating significant improvement, faculty member Richard Couto and a few students in the <A href="http://oncampus.richmond.edu/academics/leadership/">Jepson </A><A href="http://oncampus.richmond.edu/academics/leadership/">School of Leadership Studies</A> at the University of Richmond founded the Campus Community Partnership in 1993 to work with the nonprofit community to put the resources of higher education to work on community problems. Today, it remains a loose consortium of faculty and students from diverse area institutions&#151;J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, the University of Richmond (private, privileged, suburban), Virginia Commonwealth University (large, urban, public) and Virginia Union University (private, historically African-American).</P><P>For years, the Partnership staged special events, placed student volunteers in community and nonprofit programs, and sought answers to problems through community-driven research. Two years ago, through a series of community-wide meetings, the Partnership helped assess needs on a wider scale to develop the next phase.</P><P>Like many urban areas, Richmond and its surrounding counties struggle with a multitude of public policy issues and human service needs. Nonprofit, public agencies, and the citizens those agencies serve said that both resources and communication were fragmented. This fragmentation applied to those working to improve the quality of life and those seeking to access services. Strategic decision-making stalled, as did making a case to funders about market position, impact, cost effectiveness, or future direction. Organizations could not take full advantage of resources that would build each organization's capacity to do its job and reach its potential for public service.</P><H3>How the Resource Network Works</H3><P>At the heart of a diversity of requests was a need to be united&#151;hence ConnectRichmond was born in fall of 2001. At the core of the network is its first product, an email list that enables each member instant access nearly 600 Richmonders with an interest in community. Evaluation data indicate that users pass on messages regularly, reaching another 1,500-3,000 people. </P>

In order to provide members of this community with equitable access to remote interpreting, a statewide network, the Kentucky Deaf Access Consortium (K-DAC), was created. K-DAC consists of four partners: <A href="http://www.interpreting.eku.edu/center_on_deafness.html">Eastern Kentucky University's Center on Deafness</A>, the <A href="http://kydvr.state.ky.us/">Kentucky Department of Vocational Rehabilitation</A>, the <A href="http://www.state.ky.us/agencies/kcdhh/home/index.html">Kentucky Commission on the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing</A>, and the <A href="http://dmhmrs.chr.state.ky.us/">Kentucky Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation</A>. For more than ten years, the partners have collaborated on other projects, and the Consortium was a natural outgrowth of these efforts.</P><P>Federal funding for the Consortium makes access to remote interpreting and captioning possible. Via a Deaf Access Station (DAS), which is a computer workstation equipped with a camera, a deaf consumer needing services from a hearing service provider that&nbsp;does not communicate in sign language, can be linked to an interpreter in another location. With the DAS, the interpreter can use any computer that has the necessary videoconferencing software and connect with the individuals in the other location, who also have the same software. The deaf consumer can begin to ask questions while the interpreter voices for the hearing service provider. When the service provider answers, the deaf consumer watches the interpreter on the screen as the interpreter signs the translation.</P><P>The software chosen for the project is Sorensen's <A href="http://www.sorenson.com/">EnVision</A>. This product removes the delayed motion previously encountered when attempting to communicate in American Sign Language using other teleconferencing packages. Before applying for funding, the partners conducted a year-long usage feasibility of EnVision, testing its functionality and practicality over a variety of lines. In spring 2001, the first DAS using the EnVision product was deployed at the Kentucky Commission on the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing. A statewide deployment was held at Kentucky's <A href="http://www.state.ky.us/agencies/kcdhh/deafestival/main.html">DeaFestival</A>, June 2002. </P><P>Using the information gathered from the usage feasibility study and from task force data collected in 1996, the University, along with its partners, applied for federal funding for the DAS project. Application was made to the Department of Commerce's <A href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/">Technology Opportunities Program</A> (TOP) in spring 2001, and funding was approved in fall 2002. Since that time, the partners have developed an installation plan that allows 40 public stations to be established throughout the state by the end of the project in fall 2004. Given that the EnVision product has dropped in price from $500 to $150 in the past year, the Consortium's hope is that deaf consumers will eventually have this software loaded on their personal home computers.</P><P>This access eliminates the waiting time for services, decreases the need for intervention, and reduces access hardships for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. TOP believes that K-DAC will also serve as a national model of successful and replicable service provider delivery to deaf and hard-of-hearing consumers. The external evaluator will conduct the first user evaluation of the project this fall. </P><DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center><HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2></DIV>

<P>Youth suicides hit an all-time high this past year in the <A href="http://www.yksd.com/">Yukon-Koyukuk School District</a>. At issue is how to get the word out that there is indeed hope for the youth in the villages as represented by the current Internet access in schools and the future plans for home-based high speed access. I spent six weeks in three district villages (Allakaket, Koyukuk, and Manley) this past fall and winter working to share the message "The Internet represents hope and we need to recognize the opportunities it puts at our fingertips." There have proved to be many social and political barriers.</p>
<P>Just as the famous serum run to Nome years ago saved lives despite great challenges, the immediate urgency is to bring the hope for a self-sufficient future to all remote Alaskan villages. Satellite and wireless technologies can now bring high speed Internet to nearly any point on the globe. Through a <A href="http://www.mcgrathalaska.net/">unique locally-owned ISP model</a>, McGrath, Alaska is one of the few villages that has succeeded connecting 70% of all homes with 1mb high-speed wireless for $40/month without E-rate limitations prohibiting home access and Ecommerce use.</p>
<P>After seeing limited benefits resulting from this access over the past few years, citizens in McGrath now realize that their level of benefits is tied directly to their learning specific skills for turning access into social and economic value. Education is the key to opening the doors to these new opportunities, both infrastructure and info-structure must be developed simultaneously. The community steering committee has developed a plan of action and an exceptionally articulate Powerpoint presentation detailing their vision. More information about "Transforming Rural Alaska Through Wireless Technology in the Schools and Community," including additional notes about McGrath, can be found in <A href="/fall-02_winter-03/000110.html">Martin Cary's article</a> <A name=_Hlt34882518></a>in the winter issue of the <I>Community Technology Review</i>. </p>

<P>Two days after returning from a three week stretch in Alaskan villages, I arrived in Jamaica for the <A href="http://www.ictjamaica.com/">National Information and Communications Technologies Conference</a>. After the -55F degree temperatures in Allakaket, Alaska, the warmth of Jamaica was most welcome. </p>
<P>I presented a televised keynote and shared the similarities of Alaskan and Jamaican villages in their struggle for cultural sovereignty and economic sustainability. Jamaica's hope is to unleash the inherent creativity of their 2.5 million citizens via E-learning and wireless Internet access. The goal of the conference was to create a measurably effective inclusion model to motivate citizens to get involved with ongoing training programs and to create a revenue model for sustainable telecenters. </p>
<span class="subhead">The Janitor Proved What's Possible</span>
<P>Shortly after Jamaica, I returned to Montpelier, Idaho, population 2500, to participate in the three-day Bear Lake Technology Fair, sponsored by the Montpelier Ecommerce steering committee and Idaho State University. Montpelier has had 1mb high speed wireless available for several years, yet very few residents pay the $50/month because they don't understand how they might benefit. Shane Johnson is an exception. Retiring as the janitor from the local High School, Shane pursued his baseball hobby and created <A href="http://batsbatsbats.com/">a successful ecommerce business</a> selling baseball bats.</p>
<P>Shane has become very successful, filling a Fedex van daily with 50-120 packages of bats. Now he's expanding into other sporting goods supplies with several new websites. To raise local awareness about what broadband can offer to all Montpelierians, the local community steering committee is generating an ongoing series of local Internet awareness and training events to generate more local success stories. <A href="http://lone-eagles.com/montpelier-story.htm">"Homesteading the Ecommerce Frontier in Montpelier, Idaho"</a> summarizes where they are today.</p>
<span class="subhead">Building on Proven Successes</span>
<P>Surely, after over ten years of experimental community networking and community technology center projects in the U.S. and Canada, we can identify the most significant lessons we've learned. As different as they may appear, people in Alaska, Jamaica, and Idaho are asking the same key questions.</p>
<P>1. What can we show and do to motivate our people to embrace the potential of the Internet?</p>
<P>2. What specific Internet training has proven to deliver the greatest real benefits in the least amount of time, particularly for low-literacy citizens?</p>
<P>3. Do successful models exist for economically sustainable community technology centers?</p>
<P>We might advise people asking these questions to pay attention to the lessons learned and to review the resources at key sites like those of the <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">Community Technology Centers' Network</a> and the <A href="http://www.afcn.org/">Association for Community Networking</a>. </p>
<P><B>The Missing Vision and "Call to Action"</b></p>
<P>As I teach about the potential of the Internet in remote communities, I'm uncomfortable with the prevailing assumption that American mainstream communities enabled with Internet access have embraced the full potential and are basking in enlightened empowerment as a result. Somehow we've lulled ourselves into believing the Internet is NOT a powerful self-directed learning medium with unlimited entrepreneurial potential. </p>
<P>As a nation, we've thus far missed the opportunity for a national "Call to Action" to unleash the historically unprecedented potential of the Internet for online collaboration and knowledge sharing, to come together as communities, and to demonstrate how a shared vision and focused collaboration can produce dramatic positive social and economic value. </p>
<P>But perhaps this is exactly where we find ourselves today, at this time in history where we all need to recognize the obvious, that only by working together can we do what needs to be done.

<span class="subhead">The New Gold Rush</span>
<P>It is rapidly being recognized that all global communities and nations are in direct competition to determine the most effective means for unleashing the inherent human potential of their citizens using new, affordable educational information and communications technologies. "Mining raw human potential using free web tools." Those communities and nations that first prove how to unlock this human potential may enjoy a cottage industry for years to come, teaching others how to emulate their success. As Tom Grundner, founder of the early Freenets used to say, "It is just a matter of who and when."</p>

      <![CDATA[<P><IMG height=64 src="/spring-2003/img/frustrated.gif" width=64>In an earlier <A href="http://www.comtechreview.org/winter-spring-2002/000069.html">Nightshift piece</A>, I talked about local information&#151;what it is, how we might access it, why it's important to community networks, etc. Some of the information is general info that it helps to know if you live in a certain community: things like the hours at City Hall, the names of councilpersons, etc. But there's a lot of information that is very individual, the kind Tom Grundner talked about when he talked about the "radius." That's the individual expertise type of information. With either kind, the question is how to get the information both <I>to</I> and <I>from</I> the community. </P>
<P>Like most community networks, <A href="http://www.chuh.net/">mine</A> needs to let folks know that we're around so that we might collect the information that they have. This, of course, is the reason that public relations professionals flourish. However, we don't have money to hire one, so we try to do what we can. And considering that all of us have had lots of experience with different nonprofits, we do have some knowledge of various ways to get the word out.</P>
<P>In the last days of the warm, laid-back summer, our hardy core group gathered for dinner and decided that we would do more than have monthly meetings that were open to anyone who might have heard of us and wanted to put up a website. A number of people had come&#151;and continue to come&#151;to those meetings, representing various community groups, and we're hosting a reasonable number of local websites. But in the tradition of those who are excited about the web and what it can do for communities, we thought we'd actually do some programming to attract folks to our site.</P>
<P>We figured that we'd alternate these programs with the "working" meetings, and we chose dates for four community programs. Everyone took responsibility for something, and my job was organizing and publicity. We printed an attractive flyer, distributed it, and reserved space for the meetings at the public library.</P>
<P>Our first program was "Build It and They Will Come," a title that we were sure would get attention. It featured a panel of the folks who had already built websites with the hope that they might encourage the more timid nonprofits to get going on their websites. We got very good publicity from the weekly newspaper, but only the presenters showed up.</P>
<P>Instead of just going home or out for a beer, the panel gave their presentations to each other, and those of us on the board found great things that we didn't even know were on the site&#151;the case of the networkers being too busy to look beyond the home pages! One of the presenters, a non-techie, put together a really nice document that other non-techies could use in building their sites. Actually, one library patron did wander in and seemed interested in what we were doing, but as for attracting real community participation, our program was a complete bust.</P>
<P>Our next scheduled presentation was the brainchild of one of the trustees, a retired medical librarian who's formed a nonprofit to collect books for third world countries. Considering the state of the Cleveland Public Schools, he gives a goodly number of books to local teachers as well. His concept is that there are a lot of people in our community who have similar international connections around many other endeavors. He's heard about a lot of them by word-of-mouth, and he had a sense that a program on facilitating international connections on the web would be a good boost for the community.</P>
<P>But this concept is hard to articulate, let alone reduce to a catchy title. So a planning meeting ended without a decision about what to call the program. Promises were made to get material to me ASAP.&nbsp; But a few weeks later nothing had shown up. I put out email asking if we should cancel the program. "Oh no," the concept person said. "I've got people lined up." But two days before the program, he called to tell me that he thought we'd better cancel it. I bit my tongue instead of saying, "I told you so," but I made him call the library to cancel the room.</P>
<P>Still, I figured that our next meeting would be a go, and I was excited about it. Because of a joint school district, we serve two communities. And we are curious about the technology plans&#151;or lack thereof&#151;of these two communities. So the idea was to invite appropriate people from each city hall to join us to talk about the plans. We figured publicity would be easier to get in this case, since both cities have fairly formidable public relations offices.</P>
<P>Way back in the summer, the techies had agreed to organize that program. Therefore I hadn't worried about it at all, since they always come through. But after we cancelled the international program, I thought maybe it would be a good idea to remind them of their promise. So I sent out an email, to which the first response was: "Which presentation was going to be next? The ecology program or the technology plan program?"</P>
<P>
I had to let that one sit overnight before I could respond. Otherwise my email would have shouted, "AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO LOOKED AT THE PROGRAM THAT WE DISTRIBUTED?" </P>
<P>At the next meeting we decided that we really couldn't do these programs by ourselves. I sulked because I thought that the city technology plan program was a really good idea. One of the members suggested that we ask the city councils to put on a program addressing that topic. Instead of saying, "LIKE THAT WILL WORK!," I said that I really didn't think the cities would follow through and that I was really sorry that we couldn't do that program.</P>
<P>But I said that I understood&#151;as much as anybody else&#151;exactly why we couldn't do it. There's only so much one can do on the Nightshift. We have a site up and running. We host a dozen organizations. We have a forum. Not bad, really, for the Nightshift. So we were a little ambitious about the program planning. I still hope that we plan at least one program for next year. I have a Charlie Brown-like faith that the football won't always be yanked away at the last second. Community networkers are like that!</P>

      <![CDATA[<P><A href="http://www.austinfree.net/">Austin Free-Net</A>, a non-profit organization supporting over 40 community technology centers in Austin, Texas, has launched a fee-based technology assistance service called "<A href="http://www.austinfree.net/fix-net/fix-net.html">Fix-Net</A>." The following outlines some of the steps, rationale, and lessons from the development of this project, in the hopes of inspiring and encouraging other CTCs as they develop projects designed to generate revenue while providing a key service to other non-profit and public agencies.</P><P>In 2000, the Board of Directors of Austin Free-Net drafted an ambitious Strategic Plan calling for expansion of sites and services coupled with a diversification of the funding base to sustain the programs.&nbsp; Central to this plan was the development of a "revenue-generating activity for long-term sustainability."</P><P>As we pondered what this fee-based service might be, PolicyLink published an article by Josh Kirschenbaum and Radika Kumamneni (Fall 2001) called&nbsp;"<A href="http://www.ncrp.org/Report_3pgs.pdf">Beyond Access: A Foundation Guide to Ending the Organizational Divide</A>." The authors indicate that "more than 70 percent of organizations surveyed had an important or critically important need for additional information technology resources." They conclude that a current priority is "helping nonprofits fully integrate IT tools into their ongoing operations."</P><P>We began to explore the idea further, and found the need for affordable, dependable technical assistance to be strong in central Texas. Without any extensive advertising or formal program in place, from January to May 2002, 37 potential Fix-Net customers contacted us seeking:</P><DIV></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>Support in making better use of information technology in their offices and programs;</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Consultation on the issues inherent to meeting the public's needs for technology and training; and</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>A spectrum of services including setting up technology centers and programs, ongoing technical support, volunteer recruitment, training for staff and volunteers, web hosting and maintenance, and presentations about our services or issues of equitable access. </DIV></LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>Thanks to becoming sponsors of an Americorps*VISTA project, new grants partnerships and contracts supporting our work, we hired much-needed staff after developing our current Strategic Plan. Successful implementation hinged on quickly coalescing as a team and, most importantly, embracing the "inherited" plan. In a pivotal, facilitated staff meeting, we assessed our individual and organizational skills and experience built on our seven-year history including visionary founders, the City of Austin's commitment to public access, a highly-skilled staff experienced installing, networking, and maintaining over 40 public computer sites, designing and running training programs, recruiting and training volunteers, a great web site, and helping other organizations with tech planning and grant writing.</P><P>As an experienced community technology provider, we were acutely aware of the challenges of organizations working to better integrate technology even as they provide state-of-art community tech programs and other vital services. We agreed that were uniquely positioned to provide an affordable, dependable, and essential service to assist other agencies to better serve the public in their own vital ways. Our plan would not only generate a steady revenue stream to sustain our own public access programs, but we would be providing a crucial service to the non-profit and public sectors.</P><P>We had conversations potential customers to access their needs, and we researched other technology assistance providers. We prepared a preliminary Austin market analysis using <A href="http://www.guidestar.org/">Guidestar's database</A>. Other early strategies included extensive online research, workshops on relevant issues, discussions with <A href="http://www.compumentor.org/">CompuMentor</A>, a visit to <A href="http://www.npower.org/">NPower</A>, participation in <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet</A>, <A href="http://www.afcn.org/">AFCN</A>, and similar mailing lists which have been priceless. National discussions and local response to our idea confirm daily that we are part of a national trend among community technology providers leveraging their technical expertise to provide technical assistance to non-profits while ensuring the sustainability of their own programs. And, within our own archives, we found documents showing that our founders had indeed anticipated that, while public access and training would remain central to our mission, our work could eventually include providing technical assistance to other nonprofits. We drafted preliminary goals, objectives, and a timeline for implementation.&nbsp; </P><P>As we designed the pilot, we assessed our organizational capacity to determine the initial scope of Fix-Net. Staff immediately sought pro bono professional advice on legal issues, business models, pricing, billing, and publicity. Our billing and tracking systems have been tested and are ready for full-scale operation. A lawyer on our board has helped staff to create legal contracts. Examples of professional support include <A href="http://www.texascbar.org/">Texas C-Bar</A>, a local non-profit that dispenses free legal advice to non-profits and <A href="http://www.nion-is.com/">NION Interactive</A>, a multimedia production company working with AFN staff and a University of Texas student to develop publicity materials. </P><P>A key issue we pay close attention to is how the IRS would view our new revenue source.&nbsp; With legal advice we have carefully designed Fix-Net so that it will not jeopardize our nonprofit status. This means: </P></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>We offer the service only to non-profit and public agencies;</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>A sliding scale exists so that no organization will be turned away due to inability to pay;</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>We will not abuse our nonprofit status to undercut for-profit providers; and</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>The service is related to our mission. </DIV></LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>In just half a year, Fix-Net brought in $15,000 from 15 clients, including contracts with United Way to provide tech training and equipment installation to nonprofit child-care providers, with the Housing Authority of the City of Austin to implement labs and volunteer training in two public housing projects, with Parks and Recreation to conduct seniors' computer training classes, and a fee for services to the Green Builders' Conference. </P><P>Emboldened by the success of the pilot program, we are now taking steps to formalize and expand the project. A University intern and a local PR firm are volunteering to assist in designing logo and PR materials and a marketing plan. A team of business students will help conduct focus groups (also based on NPower's online documents) and market research, and assist us in completing the design of a viable business plan based on our experiences to date and focus group feedback. </P><P>An unforeseen windfall of Fix-Net has been the impetus to gain new technical skills to better serve our clients. For example, two groups hired us to install wireless networks into their facilities&#8212;a new arena for our technical staff.&nbsp; We have also increased our knowledge of Linux systems, enabling us to offer open source services as requested as well as in our own centers.</P><P>What does the future hold?&nbsp; With the upcoming full launch of Fix-Net, we expect that demand will eventually (soon?) outpace our staff capacity. We continue to identify pro bono resources but the Fix-Net budget includes anticipated paid professional services. We expect to use Fix-Net revenues and other funding to hire a Business Manager and contract qualified technicians and trainers.&nbsp; Grants are being written to cover the subsidized offerings to low-budget organizations.&nbsp; New services will be rolled out as the increased revenue allows for additional staff and expansion of Fix-Net's services. And periodic program evaluation is planned to fine-tune the program.</P><P>But just like Fix-Net's initial development, its expansion will be carefully planned and monitored.&nbsp; Is the project enabling us to better accomplish our core mission, rather than distracting us from it?&nbsp; Is the work of the project itself meaningful and related to our mission?&nbsp; As long as we can continue to answer "yes" to both questions, Austin Free-Net will continue to be a strong, growing organization through this fee-based service.</P><HR align=center SIZE=2 width="100%"></DIV>

Whenever I visit the UK scene, I am awed by (1) the scale of government resources available to CTCs and other community tech initiatives (in contrast to the US); (2) the cohesive national policy that provides a sense of identity, ongoing technical assistance, and frequent networking opportunities for these initiatives; (3) the concern for the social context in which community tech projects function; and (4) the understanding of the need for continuity of service delivery -- from community outreach through formal IT training certifications.  </P>
<P>In particular, the <A href="http://www.directsupport.org.uk/">DirectSupport</A> collaborative that David describes below is an excellent model that insures consistent face-to-face support and consultation for many community-based CTCs in the UK.  This cost-effective initiative (akin to a combination of CTCNet, America Connects Consortium, and the Circuit Rider movement) is funded, though not managed, by the national government. In the US, I see a patchwork of local, regional, and national efforts, all funded year-to-year on soft money.  In the UK, DirectSupport insures that assistance is deployed "just-in-time" and equitably to small as well as large communities, rural as well as urban. I often think how wonderful it would be to have the DirectSupport model here in the US. But, I'll let David tell the story...</P>

<H3>David Wilcox writes:</H3>
<P>UK nonprofits that pioneered online working among their members have formed a consortium to help community-based organizations set up technology centers. <A href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/ukonlinecentres/">UK Online Centers</A> <A name=_Hlt23051563></A>has a government-supported web site.  Their comprehensive support model—under which community workers in the organizations are paid to be mentors—could be deployed more widely.</P>
<P>In the UK, the Government is committed to establishing 6,000 centers in England by the end of 2002 by funding new facilities in libraries, colleges and community centers, and branding existing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) centers. The aim is to enable anyone who wants it to have Internet access near their home and an opportunity to develop new skills.</P>
<P>Center set-up costs have been funded from the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) Capital Modernization Fund, and initial revenue has been provided by the National Lottery.  Many centers are able to access ongoing revenue for learning activities from the National Learning and Skills Council, but funding for informal open access is still not resolved. Budgets over three years are about $450 million US for equipment and running costs. </P>
<P>In addition to capital and revenue funding for start-ups, the DfES is supporting two programs to provide center managers and partners with help in technology, management,, and activities and projects for center uses.</P>
<P>A community programs team at the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency runs the larger of these programs.  The <A href="http://www.communityprogrammes.org.uk/">BECTA team</A> is funded by the Government and others to support schools colleges and community educators.</P>

<TD class=Normal vAlign=top width=152>
<img src="/spring-2003/img/vrds1.jpg" alt="computer lab"></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>The team runs a"<A href="http://centres.ngfl.gov.uk/">Help is at Hand</A>"  website, email newsletter and list, organizes events for centers and supports content development. They are able to give technical advice and call on the expertise of other colleagues in the organization who work with education establishments.</P>
<P>Alastair Clark, BECTA team member, says: "Centers have been set-up in a wide variety of host organizations and it is the diversity of this 'community' that leads to a great diversity of needs. Good communication between centers is key to developing a co-operative self-help culture within the network. BECTA has played an important role in developing the sense of common identity within the UK online centers network through our program of events, web site and online discussion group."</P>
<P>In addition to this agency support, the Government recognized that centers set up by community-based organizations would need more support than those in, for example, libraries or colleges, and DfES awarded a contract to a consortium of nonprofit organizations, called <A name=_Hlt23051662></A><A href="http://www.directsupport.org.uk/">DirectSupport</A>.</P>
<P>The consortium provides centers with a comprehensive service that includes a telephone help line, a dedicated extranet including both forums and a substantial knowledge base, events, and a "circuit rider-style" mentor service. Mentors can advise on everything from start up to tech requirements, business planning and center activities. DirectSupport is developing fun "<A href="http://www.directsupport.org.uk/curiosit.htm">CuriosIT</A>" activities designed to appeal to a wide range of users not necessarily wishing to start formal training.</P>
<P>DirectSupport was able to create its service because it is run by five of the eighteen partner organizations already using a common technology platform run by <A href="http://www.networksonline.org.uk/">NetworksOnline</A>. This is a "network of networks" providing services for a range of nonprofit organizations and some 2000 subscribers.</P>
<P>The mentoring program has been particularly successful because DirectSupport was able to recruit mentors from subscribers to the system, and then pay for their work under the DfES contract. DirectSupport is in touch with some 300 centers, and has about twenty mentors active at any one time out of a total of sixty. Centers can call on mentors for at least four days support and sometimes more.</P>
<P>Jane Berry, who manages the DirectSupport program, says: "These are existing grassroots community workers. We had a team within days of launching DirectSupport, and others have been able to join as the program has developed. The online systems were already loaded with relevant content and services, and the workers at the outset were already members, so familiar with how to use the systems.</P>
<P>"This model has the most exciting potential we have discovered. It gives small voluntary sector agencies the platform for joint working, fosters relationship building and trust, and gives people a real reason to use and develop their technology skills as well."</P>
<P>The UK Government is currently reviewing how best to help community-based organizations and other nonprofits make more extensive use of information and communication technologies in their work. Networks Online is discussing with Government departments how it might extend the DirectSupport model from centers to a wider program of support.</P>

In a recent "<A href="http://www.makingthenetwork.org/docs/journal.htm">Review of Civic and Community Use of Technology in the UK</A>," I wrote: "Civic and community use of the Internet is important to the UK Government because of its targets for moving services online, and to commerce because of the insights it provides into user styles and preferences. It is also crucial in the development and re-energizing of our social and civic institutions. This article explores the potential of civic Internet use but concludes that many of our institutions are failing to rise to the challenge."</P>
<P>Several UK organizations have formed links with the US circuit rider movement, and the London Advice Services Alliance plans to launch a service later in the year. DirectSupport is demonstrating how community workers can—with backup support—extend their skills to help others make use of new technologies. </P>

These CTCs and their organizations serve a vital need in their underserved communities. Their greatest assets are the passion with which they serve their communities and the community credibility they have with their constituents because it. However, in many cases these CTCs have limited funding, small staffs and limited technical capacity. Thus, they are limited in their effectiveness.</P><P>As the nonprofit serving the Houston area to support and encourage local grass roots community technology efforts, TFA-Houston provides best practice seminars, consulting services, sharing of resources (hardware and software), and encouragement activities for community technology practitioners. In past years, when more funding was available, TFA-Houston also provided technical support to many CTCs at no cost to the CTCs. Providing this service was cost and labor intensive for TFA-Houston. In addition, this service had limited impact on the larger CTC community of Houston because the small staff (two full-time and four part-time employees) could only serve a small percentage of the CTCs. We have also learned, upon further evaluation, that the original model of free technical services built CTC dependency rather than CTC capacity.</P><P>The revised model, which now includes limited fees for services and shared "sweat equity" also includes a unique <A href="http://www./">service learning approach</A> developed in collaboration with the University Houston that builds technology capacity in CTCs through collaborative student projects. <A href="http://houston.techforall.org/submenus/resources.html">These projects are documented and shared among other CTCs across the community</A>. The benefits of this program have been huge to Houston CTCs. In addition to building technology capacity, this approach has created a unique forum for collaboration and dialogue among CTCs as students and CTCs meet together to create solutions to challenges that face multiple CTCs across the city.</P><span class="subhead">A Service Learning Approach</span><P>Introducing Community Service Learning as a teaching method allowed the <A href="http://www.tech.uh.edu/">University of Houston (UH) College of Technology</A> to promote student learning through active participation in meaningful and planned student project teams developing a variety of technology solutions to build technology capacity in the Houston area CTCs. Examples of the student team projects included developing Technology Infrastructure Plans for new or existing CTCs; designing and building volunteer or student databases to track existing and future program offerings; and designing and piloting mentoring and training programs for Technology Learning Coaches.</P><P>An important aspect of this learning experience for these <A href="http://www.tech.uh.edu/itec/ist">Information Systems Technology</A> (IST) students is the opportunity to take the knowledge and skills they are learning in the classroom in project management, team leadership, and communication, and problem-solving, and apply these skills in a real technology project team experiences, working with a local CTC. Through reflective activities, students enhance their understanding of course content, general knowledge, sense of civic responsibility, self-awareness and commitment to the community.</P><P>Another aspect of the <A href="http://www.uh.edu/academics/catalog/tec/octe_courses.html#OCTE2338">Capacity-building Community Technology Outreach Program</A> (CCTOP) is that it meets actual needs of the Houston area CTCs and is integrated into the student's curriculum as a required course for all Information Systems Technology students. The purpose behind designing this course in this manner was to provide a structured learning opportunity for IST students to reflect on their learnings and communicate their thoughts (through the use of Learning Journals) about the service they are engaged in. One specific learning outcome of the course is that the student will develop a sense of caring for others and give back to the community. Other critical skills that are developed throughout the course are enhanced problem solving, how to work effectively in project teams, and engagement skills.</P><P>In our second semester offering this required course in the College of Technology, we have found that students are excited and surprised by the value and expertise they are able to bring to the local CTCs. Many of the students had no awareness of the digital divide, or how they could help close that gap in their own community&#8212;using skills they were learning in the BS Degree in Information Systems Technology. We are currently identifying other Information Technology courses that service learning methodology can be successfully integrated into in the future.</P><span class="subhead">Suggestions For Replication</span><P>This collaborative capacity building effort has just begun. Even so, there are already several important lessons learned. To build community technology capacity in your community using a service learning approach, the following suggestions are offered:</P><DIV></DIV><UL><LI><DIV class=Section1>Choose projects that can be easily scaled and replicated with other CTCs</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Clearly define project deliverables and timelines</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Assign key persons within each institution to manage the project relationships</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Engage CTCs in the evaluation of student project teams</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Recognize and plan for capacity building that occurs with individual CTCs and with other CTCs in the community as projects are documented and shared</DIV><LI><DIV class=Section1>Provide opportunities for students to interact directly with the CTC and its constituents/clients</DIV><LI>Create &#8220;"celebration" events to recognize students and CTCs </LI></UL><DIV class=Section1><P>For more information contact <A href="mailto:will.reed@techforall.org">will.reed@techforall.org</A> or call 713-961-0012.</P><HR align=center SIZE=2 width="100%">
