    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Analogies are useful tools for lots of things
    including national policy making. Federal universal service policy encouraging open access
    to the Information Superhighway uses the transportation infrastructure analogy extensively
    towards efforts associated with putting more hardware in place--wires, modems, servers,
    routers, etc.--just as the federal government invests trillions of dollars in concrete.
    However, in my view, there is one critical difference in the federal highway system that
    undermines the Information Superhighway analogy as a basis for universal service policy:
    The highway system is maintained by public tax revenues while the telecommunications
    system is basically privately-owned (and now being deregulated). Why then, do we take a
    supply-side approach and use federal and state funds to add more physical infrastructure
    to this privately owned system when a demand-side approach may be a far more effective and
    appropriate use of taxpayer's dollars?</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Since creation of the Telecommunications and
    Information Infrastructure Assistance Project (TIIAP) in the U.S. Dept. of Commerce,
    Congress has appropriated over $118 million for &quot;demonstration projects&quot; that
    promote universal service. A recently published evaluation of the TIIAP projects awarded
    in 1994 and 1995 touts the success of this policy (Westat, '99). The evaluation notes that
    over half of these projects have been sustained past the end of federal funding and the
    federal funds have &quot;leveraged&quot; over 1.5 times the amount of funds provided by
    TIIAP.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="576" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Yet, regulatory language requires that nearly all funds be spent on
    hardware for &quot;extending existing networks to new users,&quot; and &quot;demonstrating
    new technologies for providing access.&quot; Very little can be spent on content
    development, awareness building or training. Are we to believe that government's basic
    assumption here is that the private sector would otherwise have no economic incentive to
    invest in this infrastructure?There are similar policies at work at the state level. In
    Missouri, the General Assembly and the Governor created three separate programs and
    appropriations to connect schools and libraries and create community information networks.
    In each instance, the use of the funding was limited to hardware purchases. Iowa went a
    step further and spent tax revenues on creating its own fiber optic network across the
    state to promote access and connectivity. A similar approach was followed in North
    Carolina as state revenues were used to purchase access for public institutions in many
    communities in the state. Our Canadian neighbors chose the same policy approach, using tax
    revenues--limited to $10,000 (Canadian) for each project award--to provide a high
    bandwidth connection in public places such as libraries and community centers to increase
    public access. Project winners in the Canadian Access Program generally have to provide
    the computer and any other hardware necessary to make the &quot;access&quot; really work.
    Nevertheless, several thousand such sites have been created across the provinces.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A better policy strategy and use of public
    tax revenues would be to focus on creating greater &quot;demand&quot; for this
    telecommunications infrastructure, and then rely on the commercial sector and market
    efficiencies to provide the hardware itself in recognition of this demand. Such a
    demand-side strategy would mean investing in something other than hardware for expanding
    the infrastructure. To be successful, a demand-side policy would have to acknowledge the
    existence of a &quot;community information infrastructure&quot; that exists in all
    communities and the need to establish a &quot;collective&quot; technological literacy
    (Pigg, '99).</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Community information
    infrastructure (CII) is not hardware--wires, modems, servers, routers, etc. The term also
    does not refer to how communities provide access, increase individuals' computer literacy,
    or extend connectivity. Rather, CII refers to the nature of the information
    infrastructure, e.g., the content, structure, and relationships among discrete information
    resources, providers and users, and the intended social</font><font size="1" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">function of the CII.
    To the degree these two key aspects correspond and create a new &quot;public sphere,&quot;
    democratic decision making and community building are enhanced. Doug Schuler ('96), an
    observer of community networking in the U.S. offers a parallel observation saying that
    community networks represent the capacity for &quot;building community awareness,
    encouraging involvement in local decision making, or developing economic opportunities in
    disadvantaged communities.&quot; </font><font size="3"></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Communities are vital social entities when
    there is an active, inclusive information infrastructure: mass media, gossip, community
    forums, friendly conversation on the street, and messages emanating from various
    organizations and agencies. CII is also characterized by a social network structure
    meaning that flows of information (communications) are &quot;structured&quot; by
    relationships, status and power. Community information networks that utilize electronic
    forms of communication may or may not reflect this community information infrastructure.
    Where they do, we may assume a new public sphere has come into being. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Understanding how these new public spheres
    can be created means policy makers must fully understand the role of information and its
    modes of communication in community. The assertion here is that information transmitted or
    exchanged is not sufficient to build/maintain &quot;community.&quot; The community
    networking movement has provided access to technology intended to &quot;build
    community,&quot; or contribute constructively to community development. Achieving these
    outcomes may depend on the degree to which the community network corresponds with the
    already existing community information infrastructure.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">A wide variety of community-based projects
    have been launched to bring the benefits of electronic networks to citizens, students,
    government agencies, small businesses, libraries, schools, and non-profit groups. The
    purposes of these network projects varies, but often include: providing access for
    increased inclusiveness, strengthening the economic base of the community, enhancing
    life-long learning opportunities for citizens, increasing technological literacy among
    residents, and achieving general community building outcomes. One estimate indicates there
    are about 182 of these community or civic networks. They have taken many forms: Free-Nets,
    InfoZones, bulletin board systems, Tele-villages and smart cities (Borgstrom, 1999). David
    Miller at the University of Sheffield lists 54 community networking sites in the U.K. (<a href="http://panizzi.shef.ac.uk/community/uk.htm">http://panizzi.shef.ac.uk/community/uk.htm</a>
    &nbsp; and Peter Scott lists 59 in Canada ( <a href="http://www.lights.com/freenet/">www.lights.com/freenet/</a>
    ). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Investing public funds to increase the supply
    of hardware does not build demand by increasing collective technological literacy. It is
    important for policy makers to realize that the ability to achieve these kinds of
    collective purposes associated with community networks requires more than simple
    individual technological literacy. It requires a collective literacy, a comprehension of
    what the technology will support for bringing people and their community closer together,
    with higher quality interaction than exists in the usual CII. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For example, economic
    development that contributes to stronger, more sustainable communities usually involves
    collective efforts to build a stronger, broader economic base for the community. In the
    Missouri Ozarks, several communities with CINs have organized themselves for a regional
    tourism development effort to attract visitors ultimately headed to Branson, Missouri off
    the interstate highway and through their small towns. This is accomplished by a
    coordinated effort--using the Internet--to feature local bed and breakfast facilities,
    antique shops, restaurants and historical sites that tourists might not ordinarily be
    aware of when they board the bus to Branson. In Nova Scotia, a provincial project
    organized at the University College of Cape Breton worked with local industries to
    organize a coordinated system of proposal preparation, production and delivery with a
    group of small manufacturers in the province. These manufacturers individually could not
    compete with larger companies for supplying major OEM companies with parts and assemblies.
    Communications are maintained via Internet connections provided by the Canadian Access
    Program (Gurstein, '98). These kinds of economic development projects are not effectively
    organized by individual communities or businesses without some kind of external
    intervention to mobilize the resources provided by the telecommunications system and given
    form by the CINs.</font><font size="1" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size="3"></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To increase demand for telecommunications
    services, different kinds of public investments are needed (Vendramin and Valenduc, '99).
    Funding for human resources are more important than funding for hardware and appliances.
    Investing more in human resources helps local groups think together about how this new
    form of communication can be used to increase their collective well-being, enhance civil
    society, expand the economic base of the community or increase life-long learning. Letting
    individuals &quot;stumble&quot; along in pursuit of individual technology literacy without
    a realization of the collective capacity that can be built using cybertools wastes good
    opportunities and taxpayer dollars. Developing collective technological literacy improves
    understanding of collective action processes in general<u> and</u> how cybertools can
    support and enhance these processes. Building demand around the existing community
    information infrastructure will, in turn, increase private sector investment in
    technology.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
