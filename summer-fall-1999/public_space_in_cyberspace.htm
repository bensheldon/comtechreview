    private spaces like bookstores, health clubs, and cafes, they provide a commercial-free
    &quot;public space&quot; for the exchange of ideas, an opportunity for neighbors to get to
    know each other, or simply a quiet place to explore.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">In
    addition to providing physical public spaces, community technology centers, public
    libraries, cable access centers, community radio stations, and other groups make
    electronic public spaces available. These public spaces are constantly threatened -- by
    large mergers of telecommunications companies, changes in public interest laws,
    commercialization of &quot;free services&quot; (like web mail), exaggerated risks from
    &quot;obscenity,&quot; or simply short-sighted legislators questioning modest expenditures
    like the e-rate, which provides discounts on telecommunications services to schools and
    libraries.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, conveying the importance of public
    electronic spaces is much more difficult than conveying the importance of a public park or
    school. Thus Libraries for the Future, a national public library advocacy organization,
    has developed a Telecommunications Advocacy Project (TAP). The goals of TAP include
    promoting public awareness of pending telecommunications legislation and its implications
    for public access and learning; building the skills of public access advocates in
    analyzing and influencing legislation; and promoting the development of a common agenda
    for democratic communications policies involving diverse groups such as advocates for
    public libraries, community technology centers, public access TV stations, and independent
    media arts.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When advocating for public space in cyberspace, we
    encounter two seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The first is language. How can we convey
    these ideas in a way that people identify with? Mentioning the words
    &quot;telecommunications policy' usually earns the speaker blank stares. The second is a
    lack of perceived need. New forms of communication have been promoted in such a
    consumer-oriented way that electronic communication is more often perceived as a privilege
    that should be paid for by individual consumers, rather than being a fundamental feature
    of a democratic society in the 21st century.</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Telecommunications policy is most understandable to the
    general public when it involves issues of censorship and the First Amendment. Promoting a
    public space in cyberspace is also closely related to our constitutional right to free
    speech. We, as public space advocates, need to build on this connection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recently, Libraries for the Future commissioned a study
    about some of fiscal and legal aspects of the public library, including a look at the
    question: Do we have a constitutional right to receive information through the public
    library? (Scurria, K.L., 'Public Libraries and the Law: A Preliminary Study with Special
    Attention to Issues of Interest for New York City Library Advocates,&quot; 1997, NY:
    Libraries for the Future.) This study suggests that the slogan &quot;Information is a
    right&quot; has convincing legal standing and provides a strong argument for public space
    advocates of all stripes. Here are just a few very suggestive legal opinions that show how
    First Amendment guarantees have expanded in these directions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the case of <i>Grisold v. Connecticut</i>, 1965, the
    U.S. Supreme Court held Ñ in striking down a state law prohibiting contraceptive devices
    as unconstitutional: &quot;The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the
    right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right
    to read... and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to teach... Without
    those peripheral rights, the specific rights would be less secure.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1978, in<i> First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti</i>,
    the Court argued that &quot;the First Amendment affords the public access to discussion,
    debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas... the right to receive information
    is an inherent corollary of the rights of free speech and press that are explicitly
    guaranteed by the Constitution... the right to receive ideas is a necessary predicate to
    the recipient's meaningful exercise of his own rights of speech, press, and political
    freedom.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This principle was applied directly to a public school
    library in the case <i>Board of Education v. Pico</i>, 1982. The Board of Education
    removed certain books from the school library that they considered to be
    &quot;anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy,&quot; and the
    students sued on the basis of their First Amendment right to receive information. The
    plurality of the court, ruling in favor of the students, argued that &quot;the right to
    receive information&quot; directly implicated the students' free speech rights, and
    declared that the First Amendment guarantees not only the right to self-expression but
    &quot;public access to discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and
    ideas.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The court applied this principle to public libraries more
    generally eleven years later. In <i>Brinkmeier v. City of Freeport</i>, the court
    concluded that public libraries are a designated public forum: public property that the
    government has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity. In the
    decision, the court concluded that &quot;there is a First Amendment right to access the
    Freeport Public Library.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Expansive as these decisions are, they have not yet really
    integrated how telecommunications has radically transformed the way we receive information
    over the last five years, particularly the two-way, discussion-oriented nature of the
    Internet. None of the judges could have possibly foreseen the potential linkages between
    public libraries, computer networks, community TV, and other local information sources
    that advances in technology have made possible. Nevertheless, these Courts did establish a
    legal connection between receiving, producing, and discussing information; associated
    these activities with the public library; and, most importantly, stated unequivocally that
    these activities fall within the scope of our First Amendment right to free speech.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As information rapidly migrates to cyberspace, it is now
    more important than ever to grasp and call attention to these First Amendment rights.
    Increasingly, the lack of adequate public spaces in cyberspace may deny many people their
    right to receive, discuss, and produce information. Creating innovative partnerships that
    combine Internet access and communications, TV production, community forums, and access to
    library resources is one step toward realizing our First Amendment rights. The second step
    is communicating these rights to the public. By raising awareness of these issues as
    constitutional rights, we can build a base for guaranteeing public funding to make a
    sufficient public space in the growing realm of cyberspace.</font></font><font SIZE="1"></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
