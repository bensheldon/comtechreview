    survey of community networks and the services they offer and set up the Internet Public
    Policy Network (IPPN) to connect organizations to experts on Internet public policy
    issues. The results of the study are located at <a href="http://www.internetpublicpolicy.com/communitynetworks.html">www.internetpublicpolicy.com/communitynetworks.html</a></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    training are all considered economic development issues. Community networks can
    effectively address these issues by providing local information, community interaction,
    and access to technology. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Community networking helps develop strong relationships
    between community members. Community calendars are one tool that fosters community pride
    and participation. Local residents use calendars operated by community networks like the
    Columbia Free-Net <a href="http://www.tcfn.org">www.tcfn.org</a> to learn about local
    events like community theater, church rummage sales, and political government hearings.
    Calendars increase awareness of local events and encourage citizens to participate in
    community activities they otherwise would not have known about. Community networks like
    the Twin Cities Free-Net <a href="http://freenet.msp.mn.us">http://freenet.msp.mn.us</a>
    operate forums and chat rooms that let local residents communicate with each other. In an
    America that has become balkanized by fenced-in yards, electronic community forums are an
    alternative medium for citizens to discuss neighborhood issues such as schools and road
    construction. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Increased interaction between community members can also
    lead to the development of mutually beneficial business relationships. The Appalachian
    Center for Economic Networks (ACENet) (<a href="http://www.seorf.ohiou.edu/~acenet">www.seorf.ohiou.edu/~acenet</a>)
    nurtures and strengthens relationships. ACENet operates a small business incubator where
    entrepreneurs rent space, are provided assistance, and most importantly, can interact with
    each other. Increased communication in the business community has resulted in partnerships
    in diverse businesses such as restaurants and furniture manufacturing for people with
    disabilities. ACENet is also a partner in the Public WebMarket (<a href="http://development.civicnet.org/webmarket">http://www.civicnet.org/webmarket</a>), a
    program sprearheaded by the Center for Civic Networking, that acts as a virtual incubator.
    It lets local craftsmen communicate with others in their industry. Public WebMarket also
    increases the ease with which local businesses can sell their crafts on an international
    market. Community networks can be considered virtual incubators because they often serve
    as a repository of small business resources, are a locus of community interaction, and
    provide access to the Internet's research capabilities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Community networks like Philadelphia based LibertyNet <a href="http://www.libertynet.org">www.libertynet.org</a> create one-stop information-sites
    that connect citizens to economic development resources. Community networks increase the
    number of people with access to existing programs and activities by making it easier for
    local residents to find information. Instead of creating their own jobs database, they
    provide links to job listings in the Philadelphia Inquirer, JobBank USA, and many other
    sources. LibertyNet also educates users about prominent economic groups like Pennsylvania
    Small Business Centers and Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Community networks also stimulate the local economy by
    promoting the region. A business that is considering relocating to Okmulgee County can go
    to the Okmulgee County Electronic Village <a href="http://www.ocevnet.org">www.ocevnet.org</a>
    and find valuable statistics on topics like the area's demographics and transportation
    facilities. The Columbia Free-Net actively promotes tourism. They provide information on
    the area's hotels, vacation highlights, and aggregate all the information into their
    Tourism Center.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Community networks believe that access to technology will
    increase economic prosperity. LibertyNet, along with Philadelphia's Northeast Regional
    library, provides free classes to community groups on such topics as &quot;Introduction to
    Computers,&quot; &quot;Exploring the World Wide Web,&quot; &quot;Job Searching on the
    Web,&quot; and &quot;Resume Creating.&quot; They also partner with Lincoln University to
    offer web design classes that help organizations increase productivity and lower costs.
    ACENet's Women's Sectoral Training and Empowerment Program gets low-income women off of
    welfare. Since they understand that computer knowledge cannot in itself ensure employment,
    they incorporate basic business skills into their training program. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Community networks offer disadvantaged populations cheap
    and sometimes free access to the Internet. LibertyNet helps operate the Bridge Project
    community computer lab and offers free Internet access and training 20 hours a week.
    LibertyNet also publicizes computer access at public libraries. The Eugene Free Community
    Network <a href="http://www.efn.org">www.efn.org</a> tries a different approach and
    provides Internet service to people's homes. They offer free Internet connections to
    low-income individuals. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
