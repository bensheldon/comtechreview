    <td valign="top" width="628" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Since
    1989, we have operated RTK NET (the Right-to-Know Network) in partnership with the Unison
    Institute to provide free access to environmental, fair housing/fair lending, and other
    data to empower citizen involvement in community and government decision-making. OMB Watch
    has also made use of e-mail and web activities in various legislative campaigns such as
    those to defeat a series of proposals to silence the advocacy voice of nonprofits and
    proposals in the Contract with America (e.g., a constitutional amendment to balance the
    U.S. budget and various proposals to undermine environmental, health and safety public
    protections).</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the mid-1980s, OMB Watch has
    advocated policies to strengthen access to federal government information, but has stepped
    up that agenda as the Internet has become more ubiquitous. In 1998, we launched the Agenda
    for Access project, a two year project aimed at building a base of local, state, and
    national groups interested in public access, developing tools to promote the public's
    right-to-know, and making specific recommendations for improved public policies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In late 1997, after spending a year coordinating NonProfit
    America, which was a research effort to discuss use of technology in the nonprofit sector,
    OMB Watch launched the Nonprofits' Policy &amp; Technology (NPT) Project. NPT is a
    three-year initiative to educate the nonprofits about using newer information technologies
    to strengthen public policy participation. The NPT Pilot Project Grants program provides
    small grants to nonprofit efforts that employ information technology tools and strategies
    to develop or bolster their public policy activities. The NPT Innovation Awards provides
    small financial awards in recognition of technology strategies used by nonprofits in
    public policy activities that demonstrate effectiveness, innovation, and lessons learned.
    NPT also operates NPTALK, a daily digest for professionals, experts, researchers, and
    advocates interested in nonprofits' use of information and communications technology for
    public policy activities. Later this year, the NPT Project will launch an online resource
    center to share emerging nonprofit case examples, research, and technology resources for
    public policy activities. NPT is also experimenting with ways of improving the flow of
    policy information so that nonprofits get the type of information that they want.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">OMB Watch is also a member of various efforts dealing with
    use of the Internet to bolster democratic principles. For example, we are a member of the
    Congressional Internet Caucus Advisory Committee. Despite the growing ubiquity of the
    Internet, we have found that there is still a problem with low-income, minority, and rural
    groups gaining access to both basic and higher-end technology and communications
    resources. It is often argued that schools and libraries can bridge the gap in access to
    computers and to the Internet. But this hope is not fully borne out by the current
    situation. Not surprisingly, access is not distributed randomly, but correlated strongly
    with income and education. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is, however, growing support and an increase in the
    number of community technology efforts working to meet the needs of the underserved in
    America -- minority, low-income, homeless, elderly, people with disabilities, and
    immigrant populations, in urban and rural areas. These community technology centers are an
    integral part of the communities they serve.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Along with a number of groups, including the Alliance for
    Community Media, the Alliance for Technology Access, American Library Association, the
    Association for Community Networking, Civil Rights Forum on Communications Policy,
    Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, Libraries for the Future, National
    Education Association, National Urban League, and SeniorNet, OMB Watch has been working to
    rectify the problem of inequity by highlighting opportunities for community technology
    centers to take advantage of federal funding resources, and expressing support for the
    proposed appropriations of $65 million for Community Technology Centers under the FY 2000
    Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies
    Appropriations bill.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">OMB Watch seeks to provide opportunities for nonprofits to
    learn about and utilize newer technologies for public policy activities; improve
    communication and coordination between technology and public policy professionals in the
    nonprofit sector; and identify ways to increase the accessibility to and comfort level
    with these tools for all citizens. In all our work, we are guided by the belief that
    improving access to our governmental decision-makers and energizing citizen participation
    leads to a more just, equitable and accountable government, and a healthier civil society.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
