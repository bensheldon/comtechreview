Six people had
    gathered in the portable classroom at Dawson Elementary in South Austin to talk about
    connecting their community. The six were representative of the neighborhood association, a
    local business, the elementary school, and the neighborhood recreation center. They had
    never met before, although they all live and work in the same community.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As they sat around a table in chairs made for preschoolers
    staring at a prototype website, their minds didn't jump to issues of universal service or
    community access. They talked about ideas, their collective lack of computer experience,
    and how they could work with each other to let the neighborhood know what was happening.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two weeks later, three groups returned for the first crack
    at the website. Volunteers from the <a href="http://www.main.org">Metropolitan Austin
    Interactive Network</a> (MAIN) were on hand to assist the groups in creating their
    website. Kathleen, the neighborhood branch librarian, brought information on library
    activities and book donations. She talked to Jim who was helping organize the neighborhood
    garage sale and discovered that they had something in common; Jim had extra books and
    Kathleen needed donations. Connections like these prove that technology brings people
    together in more ways than e-mail or applications. By the end of that second session,
    Kathleen, who had never dreamed of creating a webpage, was moving pictures, formatting
    text, and learning how to pass this information on. To be able to take someone from the
    community like Kathleen and show them the tools they can use and help them realize their
    capacity to create, knowing they will continue to create, is overwhelming.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The key to universal service policy is that it must
    provide both access to the technology, and the ability to use it. While private industry
    has predominantly been tasked with providing the pipeline, communities must be responsible
    for the content. Over the past nine months, through the efforts of the <a href="http://www.alaweb.org">Austin Learning Academy </a>and the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/rhodesprp">LBJ School of Public Affairs</a>, the Dawson
    neighborhood now has the chance to create content and they're taking advantage of it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So far, three organizations have posted information to the
    site, and three others will be added soon. Eventually, other neighborhood entities that
    already have websites will also be linked to the site to provide a comprehensive listing
    of neighborhood information. You can visit the Dawson neighborhood at <a href="http://www.main.org/DNA/">www.main.org/DNA/</a>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dawson Neighborhood website is not a masterpiece of
    design skill; it's not intended to be. It is the digital identity of a low-income
    neighborhood in South Austin, like so many neighborhoods across the country, that with the
    help of community based organizations, finally has a voice.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
