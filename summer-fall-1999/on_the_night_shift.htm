    commute and a family. What is so important about community networking that moves me to
    work on it during the night shift? Well, first of all, I'm nosy. I like to know what is
    going on. Furthermore, I like to have some sort of say in what is going on. An online
    community is one way to do that -- a unique way at that. My current interest is in forums
    that let us hear so many more voices than the print &quot;letters to the editor&quot; did.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I always wanted to be a policy wonk, part of the community
    networking establishment. After all, I'm an academic law librarian, venerating the think
    piece, the law review article. My emailbox is stuffed with policy material that I should
    read. Material from the American Association of Law Libraries. Material from AFCN.
    Material from the Communet listserv. I leave the material in the mailbox, hoping to have
    time to read it. I never do. Eventually, with feelings of great guilt, I delete it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not only that, my job involves acquiring material for a
    law library. Thus relevant material arrives all around me, but I never have time to read
    it. So I have abandoned my wish to create policy and to be part of the community
    networking establishment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I put my limited time on the building of networks. I've
    created them on both ends of my commute. The first one, based on the Free-Net model, was
    built in my work community, Akron. It was a true grass-roots effort that took four years
    of monthly meetings and the construction of an entire computer system to bring online a
    text-based system. The greater Akron area is about 750,000 in population, and the
    Akron-Summit County Public Library has assumed the benefits and burdens of running the
    system.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second network is at the home end of my commute. A few
    people joined me around a table, and in two years we had a network that included a forum,
    which we call SpeakEasy. This time we didn't have to build the system. We just bought
    space from an ISP, and we are web-based! CH-UH Community Network is a nonprofit
    organization with five intrepid trustees. Its communities are probably about 80,000 in
    population, and I am eager to see how the forum turns out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Do my colleagues on these projects talk about national
    policy? Not really. Why? We don't have enough time. We don't have enough information
    because we've deleted all of those posts, remember? Should we talk about national policy?
    Of course. What would help those of us on the night shift to identify the policy issues,
    act sensibly with regard to them, and maybe even get in our two cents to the policymakers?

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And here's a final thought. That type of publication can
    be phenomenally expensive. I regularly see newsletters springing up with price tags
    anywhere from $150-$1,000 per year. Some are from publishers that have been around for
    awhile, but others are from desktop publishers with no prior track record. Maybe if AFCN
    and CTCNet pool their efforts in producing such a publication, it could be a fundraiser! </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
