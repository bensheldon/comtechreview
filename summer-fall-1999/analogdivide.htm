    <td valign="top" width="575" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">In
    1871, when Andrew Carnegie funded the first of over 1000 Carnegie Libraries, there were
    something more than 250 public libraries in the United States -- and only a couple
    thousand public libraries in the world. The young immigrant Carnegie's life had been
    transformed when a mentor opened his private library to the ambitious youth. Carnegie, the
    self-made man, determined to give other motivated Americans the same chance.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Carnegie did not believe that funding libraries was charity, but
    philanthropy. Libraries only help those who are self-starters, not the
    &quot;hopeless&quot; poor. He insisted that his applicants be self-directed -- elaborate
    planning, coalition building, and some resource matching were required of any community
    applying for a Carnegie Library grant.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The 19th century public library was as novel as the public
    computer lab today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Carnegie was one of the richest men in modern history. The
    year he made his first library grant, his income was about $30M -- an unimaginable sum
    even in an age of robber baron industrialists. Today, his successor in many respects is
    Bill Gates. A self-made entrepreneur who dropped out of Harvard, Gates has built a vision
    into a colossus of modern industry. Gates is also putting his money into philanthropy,
    and, through the Gates Library Foundation, is targetting the same institution, helping it
    to provide self-development skills with modern tools of empowerment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Access to the Internet is not as simple as a plug in the
    wall -- a model that has challenged many e-rate recipients. For Americans to have
    effective equal access to information, in inner cities and rural areas, library and school
    access will not suffice to build information literacy, particularly in the adult community
    and for children who do not stay for after-school programs and voluntarily go elsewhere.
    In urban areas, community technology centers (CTCs), educational extension services, and
    community networks can provide neighborhood-oriented training and access for those who may
    not have computers in the home or, if they do, wish to learn how to take fuller advantage
    of them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In rural communities, where the nearest school or library
    lab may be an hour or more away -- especially in our western states -- publicly-supported
    dial-in, if not high-speed broadband access for young families, shut-ins, and people with
    disabilities who can't access computer labs during open hours is essential. Programs which
    receive older computers from business and government and refurbish and redistribute them
    to households and nonprofits in need -- such as the equipment lending library at Oregon
    Public Networking -- can provide training and facilitate home access. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Community-tailored information literacy education
    programs, oriented to the local culture, with instructors drawn from the community, are
    vital to the effectiveness and general acceptance of these new technologies (and vice
    versa).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Information literacy encompasses those skills of reading,
    research (including browsing/searching), computer/network literacy, information
    organization (data analysis, expository writing), and critical thinking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These skills are vital to both the development of the US
    workforce, and the individual's understanding of our increasingly complex and
    interdependent culture. Our society, and our citizenry, thrive on information -- science,
    innovation, public policy, job skills. We must insure equal opportunity and access, to
    develop our best minds, for our best future. </font></font><font size="2"></p>
