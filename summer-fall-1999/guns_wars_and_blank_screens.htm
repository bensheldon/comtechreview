    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a week on the road and offline, I'm immersed in the
    media: newspaper, NPR, mailing lists, streaming audio reports, web discussions, and phone
    calls. It's all related to the war in the Balkans and to events in Paraguay, not to the
    Dow hitting 10,000. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In two different parts of the world my friends' screens
    have gone blank, but it's just a side effect of the killing and bombing in both locations.
    The government in Yugoslavia closed down B92 radio and its counterpart in Pristina, but
    after a while they began rebroadcasting (<a href="http://www.b92.net">www.b92.net</a> )
    using streaming audio to Holland which was re-broadcast back to Serbia. Before the
    shutdown, B92 had over 1.5 million listeners. Reports are coming in from Greece,
    Montenegro, Serbia, Slovena, Russia, and second hand from Kosovo with pleas, rants,
    accounts, and calls for action. This is a war with many more nuances than our invasions of
    Panama, the Gulf War, or the recent bombings in Iraq. It is more nuanced because of the
    various channels of media. In spite of spin control here in the U.S. and in Brussels at
    NATO headquarters and severe repression of media sources in Yugoslavia, words are getting
    out. Few of us have the luxury of seeing it as a black/white situation. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    tragedy in Europe has overshadowed another one taking place in Latin America. I spent a
    couple of weeks working on community technology centers (Amic@s) in Asuncion, Paraguay in
    September 1999. I recently received a long message from the coordinator, Sergio Aranda,
    who has been working with community groups to start up more technology centers in
    residential neighborhoods around the city. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">March 23
    was to be the day for the opening of a fourth center, but Mayor Burt had to go out of the
    country on a trip and so they moved it up a few days. Luckily, the ceremony was a big
    success because on the 23 of March the Vice President of Paraguay was assassinated.
    Peaceful protests followed where a huge crowd of young people gathered in front of
    government buildings. Police attacked the students, and then a group of snipers on the
    buildings above opened fire on the crowd. The police stood by! The Mayor, however, had
    anticipated a military attack on the student protest and he had all the big garbage trucks
    come out and block the streets. Tanks approached but could not get around the trucks or
    municipal bulldozers. Then the people began throwing things at the tanks: stones and even
    radios! and the armor returned to the barracks. The snipers were on the roof of the ISP
    that provides service to the telecenters (Amic@s), and they totally messed up the antenna
    arrays that got a high speed wireless feed. So my friend and his centers were off the air
    until the crisis passed. Now he is worried that he won't be able to open the other
    centers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Using the Asset-based community development techniques he
    had groups of local people to participate for the first time in a planning committee for
    these centers which are on hold. His goal is to keep the groups together until the
    technology can be deployed again after things settle down. That may be starting to happen.
    There's a new president today, and the old one resigned and got asylum in Brazil. His
    ally, a former general named Oviedo, fled to Argentia and was also given asylum. There is
    a lot of corruption in Paraguay, and some thought Oviedo had illegal financial dealings
    with top Argentine officials. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">My friend was supposed to present his project at the
    Internet Society conference in June, but he probably won't be able to attend. I will take
    his place if he is unable to leave Paraguay. It won't be the same. </font></p>
