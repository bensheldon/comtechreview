      fundamentally change the character of communication.&quot;<em> Manuel Castells</em> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is pretty obvious that most of our institutions, work,
    schooling and recreation are being reorganized to accommodate new communication
    technologies. This is really what's behind much business restructuring as well as
    education reform in all its progressive and reactionary guises. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="578" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Certainly
    it is true of our literacy institutions as well. Literacy scholars have for some time now
    understood that notions of literacy change depending on their social and technological
    context. There are all kinds of &quot;literacies.&quot; The way we read, write and produce
    meaning is far different in our networked world from the church and school book literacy
    of the 19th Century; the way print or texts are used simultaneously in relation to
    computer data bases and on-line multimedia is transforming what it means to
    &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; in profound and unpredictable ways; and, those same
    changes in what it means to create meaning are, not surprisingly, changing the process of
    policy advocacy and activism in equally profound ways. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">With this in mind Media Working Group has begun work with adult
    literacy educators to design integrated telecommunications policy curriculum and training
    for adult literacy programs. Working with a Civil Rights Forum and CTCNet MIRA
    Telecommunications Policy grant, we are partnering with Operation Read, a state-wide
    literacy program in Kentucky, and the Carnegie Center for Literacy, who work with low
    income, rural communities. Although telecommunications policy and politics have always
    been critical areas for citizen concern they have also been, like all infrastructure
    policy, obscure and marked by exclusive, arcane language. Now the language is still arcane
    but not obscure, the importance of telecommunications policy has moved front and center as
    it has been increasingly recognized as critical to the Network Society. Media and
    telecommunication technology are the definitive infrastructure of the times. The
    deployment of these technologies shifts the basic dimensions of life. Their use dissolves
    boundaries between institutions, redefines public and private space, and changes our
    fundamental notions of community.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to work for increased awareness and
    activism around telecommunications issues and opportunities, especially in rural areas
    where market forces are not as likely to provide public resources. For example, in
    Kentucky there is no widely understood policy for the development of community-based
    applications using the Kentucky State Government's high-speed, broadband network, which is
    capable of transmitting voice, data, video and graphics. There are no policy education
    opportunities for learning how local, state and national telecommunications can have a
    positive impact on rural development or rural life in general. Similarly, there is a lack
    of understanding among Kentucky's rural populace, not unlike in cities and other states,
    regarding the public policy processes that are creating the telecommunications systems
    that are increasingly crucial to our lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As text, graphics, photography, video and audio move into
    the digital environment, the notion of text literacy becomes inseparable from
    &quot;computer literacy.&quot; Teaching literacy should, if at all possible, take place in
    a digital-network environment. And any notion of literacy -- whether it be text, media or
    computer literacy -- should mean awareness of the social and political processes shaping
    the communication technologies with which we are literate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The artists and educators of Media Working Group are very
    excited to be joining efforts in Kentucky to link grass roots literacy training with
    concepts of computer literacy and public policy. The curriculum will address how the
    public policy process works, who the players are, how the public can intervene and have a
    voice in the public process. It will work to familiarize literacy students with new and
    emerging information infrastructures, and with issues of access, particularly for
    telephone and Internet access.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The work is a part of Media Working Group's Open Studio
    mentoring initiative funded by the Benton Foundation and the National Endowment for the
    Arts. &quot;Open Studio: The Arts On-Line&quot; was created to help arts and cultural
    organizations find a presence in digital space. Media Working Group's Open Studio work is
    part of its overall effort to work with communities to use the potential of
    telecommunications for self-direction and self-definition in the emerging global economy
    and culture. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
