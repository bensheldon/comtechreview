    access television station. Fold in a community computer network and mix well. Add a dash
    of local politicians, generous amounts of on-line information and citizen input, hundreds
    of volunteer hours, and one election. Serve hot.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1996, Davis Community Television (DCTV) and Davis
    Community Network (DCN) joined forces to provide a full slate of voter information
    programming and resources during the local election season. At the time, this effort was
    at the vanguard of such networking efforts nationwide. Three years and five elections
    later, the partnership remains strong and is a recognized and remarkable contribution to
    community life in Davis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">DCTV had long produced a live, election night program.
    Davis is located just outside a major media market (Sacramento), and is largely ignored by
    the TV stations there. Without us, there would be no television coverage of local races.
    By partnering with DCN to provide on-line forums and &quot;up-to-the-minute
    coverage,&quot; we were able to greatly enhance the opportunities for citizen
    participation in the electoral process, in a manner that was informative, entertaining and
    interactive. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the weeks leading up to the election -- which among
    other things, featured a hotly contested race for City Council -- DCTV produced &quot;Meet
    the Candidates&quot; forums, aired forums sponsored by the League of Women Voters and
    other community-based organizations, and prepared for live, election night coverage. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With DCN, we asked community members what questions they
    wanted the City Council candidates to answer. People were invited to propose their
    questions in a number of ways: via phone, fax or mail; via email to DCN; on-camera during
    DCTV's &quot;Street Talk&quot; interviews; or as part of the local newspaper's
    &quot;Man-in-the-Street&quot; column. From the approximately 100 responses we received, a
    panel of DCTV and DCN volunteers culled four questions -- tough ones that weren't being
    asked via other conduits, such as candidates' forums. These questions were then posed to
    candidates during DCTV's &quot;Meet the Candidates&quot; segments.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">DCN also offered interactive on-line forums about
    campaign-related issues, and posted financial disclosure information for all candidates in
    local races as well. Traffic on these particular pages was significant, and has remained
    so during successive election seasons. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On election night itself, DCTV went live at 8 p.m. with
    two anchor hosts, and a program that included roundtable discussions by Davis' former
    mayors, interviews with candidates, campaign managers, previously recorded interviews, and
    more. New this year was the on-set addition of DCN's Web Team Chair, Steve McMahon. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">DCTV and DCN had heavily promoted that ours would be the
    most &quot;up-to-the-minute&quot; results available to Davis residents. McMahon's on-set
    computer was keyed into DCTV's system, so that the director could easily cut to what was
    on screen. He had already bookmarked and familiarized himself with the election results
    pages for both the County Clerk's and the Secretary of State's office. We also had a DCN
    volunteer on hand at the County Clerk's office, just in case technology failed us and we
    had to acquire results the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way -- via phone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Technology did not fail us, but at some point, the
    Secretary of State's site went down, and DCTV and DCN's results reporting became the only
    one available for a period of about 90 minutes. Their glitch really helped us tout our
    ability to provide up-to-the-minute returns. We knew we were successful when The
    Sacramento Bee's political editor called us to find out how Davis residents were voting in
    the Third Congressional District race! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through the years, our two organizations have experienced
    our share of successes and frustrations with each election season. We've also encountered
    policy issues en route. Most recently, DCN has had to concern itself with its emergence as
    a publisher by virtue of its role in providing election finance information and moderating
    public, on-line forums. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;DCN is an evolving organization,&quot; said its
    Executive Director, Richard Lowenberg. &quot;When we first provided a web server and
    allowed customers to publish via their subscriber accounts, DCN was developing
    infrastructure. The theory was &quot;if you build it [infrastructure], they will
    come.&quot; But when DCN obtains, organizes and serves election finance information, or
    when we open public forums, we are a publisher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;This change in role is not accidental, but it has
    forced us to consider the ethical and legal obligations of a publisher -- such as avoiding
    libel and developing policies that protect the organization and community from the damage
    caused by libel,&quot; he said. Lowenberg added that DCN's board is learning from
    precedent set in such cases as Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy that &quot;when DCN opens
    public forums, we must largely keep our hands off or make it very clear what editorial
    responsibility we are taking.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kari Peterson -- DCTV's executive director and a driving
    force behind forging DCTV and DCNÕs election partnership -- adds that &quot;these
    concerns aside, I believe that providing this kind of information and facilitating this
    kind of interaction is invaluable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Community media reaches its potential when serving
    the public's compelling need to know about the candidates they'll be voting for, the ones
    that will shape our collective civic future,&quot; Peterson said. &quot;DCTV and DCN can
    do what no one else can -- bring election results home to Davis.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our next local election is March 2000, and the
    &quot;cooks&quot; are already at work brewing up plans for another batch of electronic
    democracy, Davis style. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
