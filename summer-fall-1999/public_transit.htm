    sustainability. The first is the near total dependence on the fossil-fueled private
    automobile which creates unhealthy living conditions through pollution, saps the economy
    through congestion and makes all of society dependent upon a steady flow of imported oil.
    The underlying cause of this dependence is the way in which metropolitan areas have been
    built with housing widely separated from all other urban functions.</font></p>
    </font><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The second challenge is the gap between
    rich and poor which has been widening throughout the post-war years, and the related
    phenomenon of the spatial concentration of wealth and poverty. One cause has been
    disparities in educational achievement which tend to follow the structure of household
    income. Another is the need for access to the digital broadband network infrastructure
    which forms the means of production in the information economy. Lack of access to this
    infrastructure is responsible for the so-called digital divide.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    Line Televillage, a project of Compton and the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority,
    is one model that has an international reputation. It is a center with computers, Internet
    connections, videoconferencing facilities and training classes for its roughly 2,000
    members, mostly African American, who pay $10 a year for adults and $5 annually for
    students and seniors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Blue Line Televillage is situated next to a public transit hub in
    Compton as an experiment in creating a &quot;telework&quot; center, according to Walter
    Siembab of Siembab Associates, a Los Angeles consulting firm that helped get the project
    started. Siembab advocates the proliferation of what he calls &quot;personal network
    access facilities&quot; no more than half a mile away from anyone's home, primarily as a
    way to reduce traffic and air pollution, promote telecommuting and reconfigure urban areas
    into more convivial spaces.&quot; -- Gary Chapman, &quot;Reaching Out to Bring Low-Income

    policy does not now, but could in the future, address both of these challenges
    simultaneously, thereby improving the prospects for sustainable cities. I call this policy
    public transit for the information highway. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">At
    ground level it should consist of a system of shared-use, non-commercial network access
    centers (NACs), analogous to bus or train stations, located so that no household is
    further than walking distance from a neighborhood center, and no more than two miles from
    a village station.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Each network access center can be programmed and staffed
    to provide the functions (school classes, medical services, work opportunities, etc.) that
    address the needs of the community.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The NAC should provide non-commercial access to broadband
    networks, become the destination for many trips that would otherwise terminate outside the
    community and, in general, become the center of neighborhood or village life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The prototype NAC, the Blue Line TeleVillage (BLTV) in
    Compton, California, has just completed its third year of operation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The BLTV has six elements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Computer Center </b>-- in an 800 square foot room
    equipped with 12 pentium computers, local area network (LAN), and Internet access using
    four integrated services digital network (ISDN) lines -- has provided public access
    computing, classes, contract training for local organizations such as day care providers,
    and facility rental to other organizations interested in conducting their own computer
    training programs for employees.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Video Conference Center</b> -- in a 1200 square
    foot room equipped with a dual monitor group-scale video conference system, seating for up
    to 25 people, and three ISDN lines with an option for six -- hosted nearly 75 meeting
    durings its first nine months alone. Video conference sessions included a contract
    distance education class originating at California State University at Dominguez Hills;
    library services such as story telling for pre-school children and a book tour lecture by
    African American author Walter Mosley originating in the Pasadena Public Library; seminars
    sponsored by the Small Business Development Center; a meeting demonstrating the technology
    for local artists, and another with a Federal Transportation Administration official
    discussing possible programs with state and federal agencies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Telework Center</b> -- two semi-private work
    stations, connected to the LAN, with their own telephones and printer -- provides a
    professional work space for local residents who are home-based or for small and
    under-capitalized organizations. It is located in the City's Business Assistance Center
    (BAC) which also includes a meeting room and library, equipped with a VCR and a desk-top
    video conferencing unit. The latter is intended for local business people to obtain
    one-on-one training from mentors in Small Business Development Centers located elsewhere
    in the County.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>A</strong> <b>Circuit Rider Work Station</b> has
    been set aside so that representatives of various government agencies (e.g., a benefits
    counselor from the Social Security Administration) can schedule visits at the BLTV to
    provide information or directly deliver services to constituents. It has been used by the
    federal Office of Personnel Management, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and
    BLTV administration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Kiosks</b> -- Small stand-alones from the Los Angeles
    Housing Authority, the AIDS Information Center of the County Museum of Science and
    Industry, and ATMs for the Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of America provide additional
    complementary resources.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Community Meeting Room</b> -- a large space that
    can seat up to several hundred -- has hosted numerous large gatherings, including the BLTV
    planning meeting attended by 150 community leaders, BLTV Advisory Board meetings, a
    Compton Chamber of Commerce mixer, and a Women's Day Conference. Other organizations have
    held meetings there in order to tour or to use some other element of the BLTV, including
    the Regional Business Assistance Network of the Los Angeles Economic Development
    Corporation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The BLTV has started the process of becoming a community
    meeting place -- the Inner City Computer Society holds regular meetings and training
    sessions, children's services groups have used the Center, and kids gather there after
    school and over holidays.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the lessons learned from the prototype was that an
    NAC can simultaneously provide non-commercial, community-wide access to broadband
    networks, electronic versions of a variety of &quot;place-based&quot; urban functions, and
    a broad program of business and individual support services.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Overall, the TeleVillage designation suggests that the
    addition of a network access center to an existing center of government and commerce can
    in time transform the entire complex into a sort of village center, where up to 75% of a
    community's social and economic needs can be met. Three characteristics in particular
    distinguish an NAC.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The technology platform is broader than either a computer
    or cable access center. NACs include computers, offices, cubicles, desk top video, group
    video conferencing, meeting rooms, speaker phones, collaborative work technologies, DVDs,
    video and production and editing equipment, broadband communications service as well as
    furniture, carpeting, and space. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Like a community technology center (CTC) or cable access
    center, the content of each center provides non-commercial access to the means of
    production in an information economy -- and an NAC will also provide access to every other
    urban function that can be put onto a broadband network. This includes distance education
    programs such as international trade seminars for small business, community college skills
    training classes, university extension classes, teacher training classes, and contract
    education for corporate employees. It includes telemedicine services such as medical
    consultation, remote eye/ear/nose/throat and dermatalogical exams, remote fetal
    monitoring, pre-natal counseling sessions, and certain components of HMO home-health care.
    It includes many government services and business services (e.g., banking services from
    ATMs to automatic loan machines).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The range of activity is especially important because it
    is this quality of concentrated urban functionality which justifies permanent, structural
    government support. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And this leads to the third unique characteristic. This
    suggests that a system of NACs can legitimately claim financial support from a diversity
    of sources, transportation and economic development funding programs as well as the more
    commonly-looked to telecommunications and education sources. In fact, the BLTV was funded
    by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA, reauthorized in 1998 as
    TEA21), not by the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program
    (TIIAP). Currently, there is substantially more money available for mobility projects than
    for information technology projects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While more individual NACs can be developed, the next step
    in the evolution of a public transit communications policy to support sustainable cities
    is a metropolitan scale demonstration of a system of three-five network stations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be that the fastest and most cost-effective
    approach to this scale demonstration is to transform an existing system of community
    technology centers. An NAC uses a broader technology platform and provides many more urban
    functions than a traditional community technology center (CTC). Some CTCs are already
    moving in this direction. Many others have space to expand, a transit-accessible location,
    and innovative management. It ought to be an appealing possibility for CTC managers and
    board members interested in expansion.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
