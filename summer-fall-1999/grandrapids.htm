    principle that access to the tools of information creation and dissemination is a
    fundamental human right and that governance of the content of that information is not
    within our purview ethically or legally due to the First Amendment to the Constitution of
    the United States of America. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We honor the original meaning of the words
    &quot;community&quot; and &quot;communication&quot; meaning &quot;to share.&quot; We will
    share information through instruction. We will share creation through acquiring
    information tools and providing them at a low cost to citizens. We will share access to
    information distribution channels via any and all means appropriate including bells and
    optical fiber. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our mission is &quot;To Build Community Through
    Media.&quot;</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Community Education</b> -- Over the next 25 years we
    anticipate the ongoing need to share knowledge with the public regarding media creation,
    media tools and media dissemination. We will continue to provide face-to-face as well as
    on-line training opportunities. We will continue to share information about the
    &quot;why&quot; of media as well as the &quot;how to.&quot; Media Literacy will become
    increasingly important over the next 25 years as corporate consolidation will create
    companies far larger than governments with no implied or stated desire to operate of, for,
    or by the people. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Tools</b> -- Over the next 25 years we anticipate the
    ongoing need to share media equipment, hardware, and software with the public. Our hope is
    that costs will continue to decline and quality improve so that we can consolidate
    expensive information tools in easily accessible locations for public access. From
    megaphones to optical data lines, we will be the medium between the public's need to share
    information and the need to gather information. Additionally we anticipate a need for open
    bandwidth access and community routing centers to accommodate versatile switching systems.
    </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Transmission</b> -- Over the next 25 years we
    anticipate the ongoing need to share modes of information transmission with the public.
    Every possible option of transmission should be exploited for citizen use. We recommend
    the 5% rule. In order for commercial communication companies to use our valuable public
    rights of way, we the people require access to 5% of available bandwidth and 5% of gross
    revenues to accommodate citizen access to that bandwidth. In addition we must preserve the
    public access gains acquired through bandwidth set asides for public radio, television,
    ham radio, cable access television, and the Internet. Here, too, the First Amendment must
    apply. The CMC must remain content neutral in information transmission. Where possible, we
    must just route bits, bytes, pixels and words with no implied editorial control.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Archives</b> -- Over the next 25 years we anticipate
    the ongoing need to store local media for public access and retrieval. Any culture that
    doesn't respect and honor its past is likely to decline. Any culture that doesn't pay
    attention to the mistakes of history is likely to repeat them. The CMC will attempt to
    catalog and store significant local voice, video, and data media in a fashion to allow
    easy access and retrieval by the community we serve. Ideally we can convert information
    into a digital realm and then store it in a permanent limited access fashion and a
    permanent public access fashion. This duplication of storage will allow for redundant long
    term survival of local media materials.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Public Policy</b> -- Over the next 25 years we
    anticipate the ongoing need to communicate with local, state and federal officials
    regarding the importance of community communication in a capitalist society. Our task is
    to be ever vigilant in light of a national approach to treat information as a commodity
    similar to ice cream. We feel the <i>laissez faire</i> approach to managing the country's
    information systems is not in the best interest of society at large. Market forces, when
    applied to information technology, favor size over substance and power over public
    service. If, as Jefferson states, &quot;Information is the currency of democracy,&quot; we
    want to create public access mints where citizens can generate currency at will regardless
    of cost or content.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">International Relations</b> -- Over the next 25 years
    we anticipate the ongoing need to reach out to global citizens to share information
    training, tools, and transmission options. Many governments on Earth despise the notion of
    citizen access to media for the simple reason that it may erode their control and power.
    &quot;The only justifiable purpose for political institutions is to assure the unhindered
    development of the individual,&quot; Albert Einstein said. We intend to work with local
    and global citizens to insure their unhindered development via community communication.
    Additionally we intend to profile the media works of global citizens in all venues to
    build an appreciation for other cultures. </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Organizational Structure</b> -- Over the next 25 years
    we anticipate the ongoing need to insure a governance model that blends form and function
    to accomplish our mission. We need to be as flexible as required to adapt to the
    environmental changes around us while preserving our principles in action. Where possible
    we will provide autonomy to insure the unhindered development of those involved while they
    provide for the development of the CMC as a whole. Where possible checks and balances will
    be created to insure the perpetuation of immediate actions and long term developments.
    Under all circumstances the CMC will be operated of, for, and by the People. </font></font></p>
