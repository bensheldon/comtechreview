Harvey</font></a><font size="3"><p><font face="Times New Roman">As we approach the 21st century, the public's right to basic
    services, including electricity, running water and telephone service is taken for granted
    by most Americans. The fact remains that not all people have this right. Indian
    Reservations stand out as the most obvious example in this matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Recently I bumped into a friend of mine in Albuquerque.
    After some initial chitchat he mentioned that his cousin who was living with him had
    passed away. I had not heard about this and asked him when. He explained that it was a few
    months ago, and that they had some problems contacting his family at the time. No one in
    his immediate family had telephone service so they had to call the Tribal police station
    and have them relay a message to his family. Not only was this a tragedy, but it seemed so
    cold and harsh to have a police officer come knocking at the door of this poor family in
    the middle of the night, to bring bad news. Funeral arrangements, and coordination to take
    the body home, was also difficult as the family did not have telephone service to stay in
    touch with each other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As anyone who has ventured into the remote areas of Indian
    country knows, telephone service is extremely dismal. The number of households with
    telephone access is less than the national average, and public access pay phones are
    scarce.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">I myself have had to deal with the lack of telephone
    service on the Reservation. Recently, during the Tax filing deadline, I was almost in a
    panic to reach my mother to locate some past records I had left at her place. I could not
    reach her or any other person that I knew, in a town of at least 500 people. No one had
    telephone service! I was finally able to contact the school where my brother worked and
    left a message for him to call me collect. Now that is third world! Even some sort of
    voice messaging system would be better than nothing at all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the major problems we face is the unwillingness of
    the telephone companies to provide basic telephone service in these areas. Basic telephone
    service is unavailable in some areas because the actual telecommunications infrastructure
    is non-existent. The telcos' excuse is that the cost of providing service to these areas
    is not justifiable in relation to the profit from the customer base.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since telecommunications companies are fractured and zoned
    within the Reservations a local call to a town less than 20 miles away turns into a long
    distance call, while a call from an area 30 to 40 miles away is a local call. This is
    because of the territorial boundaries that different telecommunication companies operate
    on. If a person can only make long distance calls, the difference in the phone bill
    becomes more than a household with a less than average income can afford. Thus a
    discontinuance of the phone service is inevitable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Health problems continue to plague the Indian population.
    Cardiovascular disease, diabetes and liver disease seem to show no evidence of lowering. A
    system called linkup or lifeline enables people with health problems, elderly and low
    income to maintain basic telephone service, even if long distance service is discontinued.
    However, some telco companies do not always honor this system. Many disastrous results
    could have been avoided if basic telephone service were available.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another incident I recall, is the time the mother of a
    friend of mine went into a diabetic shock, and had to be driven 30 miles to the IHS
    because an ambulance could not be called due to lack of telephone service. Not only have I
    heard of fatalities that could have been avoided if emergency medical teams were called,
    but also simple prescriptions were not ready on time because calls were not placed. My own
    mother used to use the telephone to call in for a refill of her blood pressure medication,
    but lost the ability to do so when her telephone service was discontinued.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An ideal situation to remedy some of these problems would
    be for the Tribes to own and operate their own telecommunications companies, thereby
    localizing calls within respective Reservation boundaries. Several Tribes have already
    made this a reality. However, the cost of undertaking such a task is too often
    overwhelming for most Tribes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Policy change must come from the telephone companies. This
    change has to be initiated by the FCC, and carried out with full cooperation of Tribal
    entities involved. If this change is not to take effect immediately, policy change must
    take effect concerning basic telephone service for those individuals in need, within
    telephone companies. This is a must. Emergency calls and 911 access has to be available
    for individuals who are in need. Telephone service in Indian country must be addressed,
    and steps taken to assure that all who need service are provided an opportunity to obtain
    telephone service</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then and only then, can we begin discussion concerning all
    other aspects of telecommunication technology, including the Internet. </font></p>
