    been working to liberate cable television, video equipment, computers and phone lines for
    public use. Public, educational and government access (PEG) channels exist in more than
    2000 communities across the United States. Community computer centers, civic networks and
    public technology initiatives dot the rural and urban landscapes across the globe. While
    the 1990's herald a new era of cable and telephone consolidation, community
    media/technology activists have not been far behind. We have been engaged in our own forms
    of digital convergence: forging strong collaborations, staking a claim for federal funds,
    shaping foundation priorities, and building a base of local support throughout the global
    digital economy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As media activists in Vermont we pride ourselves on our
    manageable size and pro-consumer culture. Since 1984, we have established 23 community
    access channels in the state's largest and smallest communities. In the process, we have
    been able to gain strong support from Vermont regulators who view public, educational and
    government access as mainstays of cabled communities. Despite the fact that cable
    subscribers are charged (in their bills) for the operation of PEG channels, the allocation
    of public, educational and government channel space is viewed by state regulators as
    compensation for the cable operator's use of the public rights-of-way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In our state and many others, it became clear that the
    cable and phone companies were taking advantage of the deregulated marketplace and quickly
    getting into each other's business. We could see, and it has been proven, that
    de-regulation would result in less consumer protection and more de facto monopolies. In an
    effort to ensure community access to all forms of telecommunications in Vermont,
    Chittenden Community TV (CCTV) public access advocates and producers located in Vermont's
    largest county proposed a model of locally available public telecommunications facilities
    to be funded through a state-wide universal service fund. It was a new concept for the new
    decade, and regulators and legislators could not yet imagine what such facilities would
    achieve. It became clear that we would have to demonstrate this concept in order to have
    any long-term impact on state-level telecommunications policy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our demonstration, the Old North End Community/Technology
    Center is modeled on the tradition of Playing to Win, civic networks and CyberSkills. More
    than a public access facility, the Tech Center has worked, since 1995, as an engine of
    economic and community development. As we anticipated, in 1996 the Vermont
    Telecommunication Plan adopted our model as an important example of access and capacity
    building for the Information Age. The Plan discusses electronic community and cites PEG
    access and expanding use of the Internet as foundations of Vermont's electronic community.
    By legitimizing community access and new forms of electronic community, the Plan moves our
    collective work into state level policy discussions that point us to the next chapter of
    building a democratic information society in Vermont.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next chapter of community access to digital
    technologies is playing itself out in the re-franchising of Vermont's largest cable
    operator, Adelphia Cable Communications. After a series of recent acquisitions, Adelphia
    accounts for 90% of Vermont's 140,000 cable subscribers and is now the fourth largest
    cable company in the country (with five million subscribers). The company's annual report
    touts them as a provider of bundled telecommunications services. In the past several
    years, they have built their own telephone company (Hyperion), bought the Buffalo Sabres,
    merged with a number of smaller cable companies and added a variety of digital services to
    their cable offerings. It is these services -- digital tv, high-speed Internet service,
    paging services and long distance services -- that account for a 35% increase in revenue
    during the last quarter of 1998. Multi-channel news reports the one year growth in their
    digital service revenue (video and Internet) to be 127%!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the midst of this tremendous expansion in services and
    revenue growth, Adelphia continues to utilize the public rights-of-way of Vermont. They
    plan to increase channel capacity, interconnect their Vermont systems into a statewide
    network and expand high-speed Internet services to everyone. Because the company is asking
    for an eleven-year contract renewal, Vermont access advocates are arguing for a larger
    public piece of the commercial pie. Using regulatory precedents from Vermont, Ohio,
    California and Illinois, we are currently advocating for an expanded definition of public
    access. In recently filed testimony before the Vermont Public Serivce Board, we have
    requested additional bandwidth (rather than channel) capacity for a local and state-wide
    civic network that would provide statewide access channels for public video and data
    services. These services will range from state-wide legislative programming, educational
    programming (distance learning), to coverage of live public events. It is our position
    that once Adelphia uses the cable network to provide Internet services, they are obliged
    to provide free Internet drops and modems at specified public, educational and municipal
    locations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As you might expect, Adelphia does not agree that expanded
    use of the public rights-of-way means expanded public access. In order to protect the
    public interest for Vermont (and for the rest of the country), Vermont PEG advocates will
    defend the public interest before the VT Public Service Board, provide evidence of the
    strong community support for PEG services, cite precedents for expanded definitions of
    public access around the nation and advocate for consumer protection in a rapidly
    deregulated, increasingly expensive and significantly less accessible telecommunications
    marketplace. Stay tuned. </font></font><font SIZE="1"></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
