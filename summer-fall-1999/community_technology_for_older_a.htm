    adults on computers, the issue of access to technology for older adults was critical. It
    seemed likely that an entire generation was going to be left out of the information
    revolution unless drastic action was taken to include them. Since that time it has become
    clear that there is a digital divide between those who have access to technology and those
    who don't, but that increasingly that divide is the result of economics, race, and
    geography as well as age. This development raises a host of public policy issues, but the
    most pressing is the need to develop sustainable models of community technology centers
    that include programs for older adults. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="694" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Since
    1986 SeniorNet has become the largest trainer of older adults on computer technology and
    the Internet. There are more than 158 SeniorNet Learning Centers in 35 states, and one of
    the most prominent sites for older adults on the World Wide Web is <a href="http://www.seniornet.org">www.seniornet.org</a> . As SeniorNet has grown it has
    developed a successful business model for local-national non-profit collaboration, but
    without a significant public policy initiative this model cannot not be successful
    duplicated in low-income and rural communities. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Currently,
    SeniorNet Learning Centers are heavily concentrated in urban, middle class locations. In
    response to this problem, in 1997 the SeniorNet Board of Directors mandated that at least
    50 percent of all new Learning Centers be placed in low-income or rural communities. In
    the past two years, 70 percent of new Learning Centers have been located in low-income or
    rural communities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Much of SeniorNet's program is easily adapted for
    low-income and rural environments. The peer teaching model and specialized curriculum work
    well in any place where older adults are trying to learn computer technology. SeniorNet's
    business model, however, is less adaptable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a non-profit organization SeniorNet has developed a
    business model that serves the dual purpose of providing low-cost services while providing
    a mechanism for the program to be self-supporting in the long run. In brief, the model
    works as follows. Everyone who takes a class at a SeniorNet Learning Center is required to
    pay a $35 annual fee to join national SeniorNet. The local non-profit partner who hosts
    the Learning Center then charges whatever fee they feel is appropriate for the courses
    they teach (the average fee is $35 for a 16-hour course, but many local Learning Centers
    charge as little as $5/class). The local partner organization keeps the class fees and
    uses this money to upgrade their Learning Center and support other programs. Overhead is
    kept low by having a rent-free space as well as volunteer instructors and coordinators
    (trained by SeniorNet) who teach classes and run the program. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This model has worked well for SeniorNet allowing for
    rapid expansion while keeping numerous Learning Centers operating over the long-term
    (several Learning Centers recently celebrated ten or more years of operation).
    Unfortunately, in rural and low-income areas this model is more difficult to maintain.
    This is not only the result of the SeniorNet membership and class fees (SeniorNet has a
    scholarship fund, but it will become depleted over the long-term), but also because it is
    difficult to find the skilled volunteers necessary to keep the program operating with a
    low overhead. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another model of operation has evolved at two SeniorNet
    Learning Centers in both low-income and rural areas. Surprisingly, the same model appears
    to work, at least in the short-term, in both areas, and arose independently in both rural
    Arkansas and urban Detroit. This model requires that paid staff be hired to run the
    program and teach classes as necessary. Although both Learning Centers are fee-based,
    neither will be self supporting in the long-term without significant assistance from
    outside sources. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This situation is of grave concern to SeniorNet because
    without a model that is self supporting in the long-term it is difficult to secure the
    initial funding to open Learning Centers. SeniorNet also shares the concerns of various
    funders that it will be impossible to keep these Centers operating on a long-term basis
    without long-term outside funding. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">SeniorNet's research as well as our long experience shows
    that older adults need not only access to computers, but also training about how to use
    the equipment in order to successfully bridge the digital divide. It is also clear from
    our experience that rural and low-income older adults do not have access to these services
    and that as a result they are being left by the side of the road of the information
    superhighway. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Clearly, without a public policy initiative that ensures
    the long-term existence of community technology centers (and this needs to be multi-year
    support) that includes subsidized staff, the digital divide for older adults in low-income
    and rural communities will only continue to widen. It is essential that we take steps to
    ensure that all Americans can participate in the information revolution.</font></font></p>
