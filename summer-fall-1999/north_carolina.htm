    strong commitment to local community. As a result, we see vibrant oases of activity around
    the country -- in places like Seattle, Austin, and Charlotte. But unfortunately, when we
    look at the U.S. as a whole, the &quot;holes&quot; are much larger than the cheese. How
    can public interest technology -- this developing family of resources of community
    networking, recycling programs, mentor programs, assistance to other nonprofits, community
    technology centers -- be more equitably distributed around the country -- especially to
    small towns and rural areas?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One way to address this challenge is to look at the states
    as the engines of diffusion across the digital divide. Devolution of funding streams to
    the state policy level -- especially in areas that impact disadvantaged populations like
    welfare reform, job training, and rural development creates new opportunities. All these
    issues are ones in which public interest technology (PIT) can make a difference. To
    respond effectively, the PIT community needs to organize at the state level to make the
    case for capturing funds to address these issues. In fact, PIT has an important role in
    citizen education and participation -- as a tool for insuring that disadvantaged citizens
    have input into the policymaking that affects their lives -- at all levels of government. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another important role for public interest technology is
    at the intersection of communities and communities of interest. State level associations
    are mushrooming for everything from community development corporations and health centers
    to libraries and arts organizations. Since these groups usually come together for annual
    conferences, electronic communication enables them to sustain relationships in the interim
    between face-to-face meetings. PIT makes sense as a way to insure that local affiliates
    have the technical support they need to participate in online collaborations and as a way
    for constituents to share experiences and understand the power of technology to aggregate
    their voices for decisionmakers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cross sector partnerships at the statewide level model and
    promote local collaborations as well. Public interest technology can help overcome the
    &quot;stovepipe&quot; approach to technology planning whereby each institution -- school,
    government agency, library, health facility, other nonprofit -- develops an internal
    strategy for a narrow constituency that fails to take account of broader community needs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the electronic democracy tools of public interest
    technology -- public access, low cost hardware and dialup access, training and technical
    assistance, online conferencing, non-commercially driven community publishing, web and
    listserv hosting -- can be delivered more economically and efficiently when resources are
    pooled. Statewide cooperation can allow specialization.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Statewide funding pools through either the state
    legislature or the state utility commission offer the possibility of long term
    sustainability for public interest technology activities. <a href="http://outreach.missouri.edu/moexpress/">Examples include the Missouri Expres</a>s ,
    the <a href="http://metronet.syr.edu/newrfp.html">New York State Diffusion Fund </a>, the <a href="http://www.tifb.state.tx.us/">Texas Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund</a> , and
    the <a href="http://www.occcn.org/">Ohio Community Computing Center Network </a>. Each
    state his creating its own unique approach building on local interests and strengths. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here in North Carolina there is an email list (the North
    Carolina Nonprofit Users Group), a website (the <a href="http://www.ncexchange.org/gateway">North Carolina Community Information Gateway</a>,
    which cross-links statewide communities of interest and links statewide issue areas, and
    an online database of statewide technology resources (<a href="http://www.ncexchange.org/techsupports">Tech Supports for Nonprofits).</a>.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Helping citizens and organizations understand that they
    have a personal stake in the information age broadens support for the larger public
    interest technology agenda. Often overlooked, particularly active communities of interest
    are mushrooming and can develop as a collective voice to aggregate their clout with
    electronic democracy tools. More extensive use of virtual volunteering makes sense here.
    In this way, smaller communities can focus on the kinds of hands-on PIT activities that
    can only be provided on site.</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An email discussion list is a good first step and can
    promote development of a statewide wish list and policy agenda. But whatever strategy is
    used, facilitation (preferable paid) is a must.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While everyone can benefit from a statewide effort to pool
    resources, deploy PIT more broadly and equitably, promote cross-sector policy initiatives
    and tap state-based funding streams, it is rarely anyone's top priority. While each state
    must find its own unique path, it needs to be somebody's job to nurture and support that
    statewide vision. Otherwise, who will fill in the &quot;holes&quot;? </font></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
