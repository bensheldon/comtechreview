    and their respective regulatory agencies are establishing new rules, framed under the
    Telecommunication Act of 1996. While the Act does limit local and state regulatory
    authority in favor of creating market competition and innovation, it does preserve the
    important historical local authority to manage public rights-of-way and require fair and
    reasonable compensation from telecommunication providers. Under the Act, companies wishing
    to enter new markets and install new facilities are subject to municipal control and
    compensation for use of the public rights-of-way. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="224" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="1" face="Arial">In the fall of
    1996, the Michigan Business Roundtable and the Michigan Jobs Commission provided funding
    for a research project to be performed by students under the supervision of faculty from
    the Michigan State University Department of Telecommunication. The goal of this project,
    titled TELCOMATRIX/MI, was to outline processes involved in securing initial and
    subsequent agreements, permits, and assorted permits for and affecting telecommunication
    and information systems and services in selected Michigan communities. Pre-selected on the
    basis of typical or atypical telecommunication policy strategies, these nineteen
    communities included: Ann Arbor, Birmingham, Canton Township, Dearborn, Detroit, East
    Lansing, Farmington, Flint, Grand Rapids, Holland, Lansing, Lansing Township, Livonia,
    Marquette, Negaunee, Southfield, Sterling Heights, Troy, and Wyandotte.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="515" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Passage
    of the Act coincided with the creation, licensing and start-up of many new wireless
    personal communications services (PCS), authorized by the FCC through auctions, which
    raised $23 billion for the U.S. Treasury. Since the Act also reserves local zoning
    controls, new wireless providers that want to put up facilities and structures such as
    towers and antennas are subject to local zoning authority. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet, despite the important role reserved for local governments in
    the development of new technologies and their infrastructure, our survey of 19 local
    communities in Michigan* found the overwhelming majority of them ill-prepared to meet this
    challenge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In conducting the study, we visited community libraries
    and city halls for diverse documents including copies of ordinances, budgets, permits, and
    franchise agreements. As needed, we met with officials who explained local
    telecommunication procedures. What we found was: Most communities had no single contact
    for telecommunication issues. This role was often distributed among several offices. Local
    government officials were frequently unaccustomed to the wide range of telecommunications
    issues and terminology.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since cable television franchise agreements have
    historically fallen under local government control, all but one local government did have
    very specific policies in this area. On average, the contribution of the cable franchise
    fee to the general city fund was 0.52%, with cable providers usually contributing between
    3% and 5% of their gross revenues. (The ratio for Negaunee is high, 10.57%, because the
    city itself owns and operates the cable system.) Bonds are required in many communities,
    for security, performance, and construction. Various forms of insurance are also generally
    required. Most cable franchises are in effect for fifteen years and need to be renewed
    through an application process initiated prior to the expiration of the contract.
    Transfers may be allowed but require community approval.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In contrast to this regulatory structure, few local
    governments have well-developed interactive (two-way) telecommunication policies, Ann
    Arbor, Lansing, and Troy being the most advanced. Seven governments do not have any
    written policy at all related to interactive voice, video, and data communications
    services. At the time of the study, there were no wireless-specific ordinances in effect
    in any of the nineteen local communities, though Grand Rapids and Livonia were reviewing
    drafts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Three local governments themselves own, operate or lease
    telecommunications infrastructure (Holland and Wyandotte as well as Negaunee). Local
    governments do have general procedures or policies applicable to wireless
    telecommunication service, commonly governed under zoning regulations. Some communities
    are working together to rewrite policies. Protect Public Rights-of-way from
    Telecommunication Encroachment (PROTEC) is a coalition of Michigan communities with the
    common goal of protecting local governments rights to manage public rights-of-way. Four of
    the surveyed communities (Dearborn, Livonia, Southfield, and Troy) are members of PROTEC.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Overall, however, most local governments in Michigan do
    not have well-defined local telecommunication policies to cope with changing
    telecommunication industries and regulatory environments. Our investigation should offer
    useful guidance. New policies and agreements should be developed to manage rights-of-way,
    handle siting issues, and obtain fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications
    providers. Telecommunications should be addressed in local master plans as well as in
    community visioning and economic development strategies. Strategic alliances among local
    governments, industry, and the community should be explored. It is essential that local
    governments continue to provide input into the development of federal regulations and new
    state laws as well as monitor court decisions interpreting the new act. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
