    <td valign="top" width="623" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Much
    to-do and media attention has been focused on the little boy or girl from the
    &quot;undeserved&quot; community, sitting behind a big computer screen, glancing at their
    first view of the Internet. From grant opportunities to major partnerships with the big
    technology giants, the transformation from hopelessness to hopeful is occurring. Yet the
    cries of the victims resonate, calling out for vindication. How long, how long before the
    wicked are silenced and the poor receive rest from their woes. Strike three, you're out,
    mandatory minimum sentences, lack of economic development opportunities, lack of vision --
    and the people perish. Ignorance takes another life into its grasp and chokes away the
    ability to dream and breath. Who amongst us will fill in the breach in the hedge?</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">The publicly funded communications infrastructure serves the needs
    of the private sector far more than that of the public one which paid for its creation.
    Especially for kids like Keisha, a resident of New York City, whose parents patiently wait
    for her monthly visit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The typical bus ride on visiting day takes eight hours.
    Oftentimes family members gather at 5:00 am to wait in line to visit with a loved one.
    Life is hard for fathers, mothers and children. For a bright, unassuming nine year-old
    like Keisha, it's typical to watch sitcom families as they sit down at the dining room
    table, breaking bread together, discussing the week's events. Not so for Keisha. Yet her
    innocence remains intact, a child longing to visit her father, who is confined as a
    maximum custody prisoner at Green Haven Correctional facility, upstate New York. Hard
    times, heart choices.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During this particular visit, however, life seeks to
    imitate art. Rameek, a prisoner and member of the National Trust's &quot;From a Liability
    to an Asset&quot; Human Resource development group, poses the following scenario to Dr.
    Garry A. Mendez, Jr., the Trust's Executive Director: &quot;During my daughter's recent
    visit, Keisha said to me, 'Daddy, I'll be glad when me, you and mommy can sit down and
    have dinner together like all the other families do!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rameek pauses to gather himself and asks Dr. Mendez,
    &quot;How can I tell my daughter that her simple wish will never, never happen in her
    lifetime. With what words do I lovingly yet honestly tell her the truth? You see, both her
    mother and myself are serving life sentences, with <i>no chance</i> for parole. How do you
    go about the business of breaking a little girl's heart and shattering her hopes for the
    future? How can I, as a parent, assist in the raising of my children, when I physically
    cannot be there for her? There's not enough time during our two hour visit to correct a
    month's worth of homework, listen to her stories or taste the new recipe she experimented
    with.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even as the Internet offers unique opportunities for
    economic empowerment, we seek to utilize the tools of the trade to open opportunities for
    effective communications between the incarcerated and their families. Many of the Trust
    fellows have Master's degrees and assist by offering on-line tutoring from the correction
    facility to a local community center in the area where the inmates' children live.
    Resurrection group mentors correct and encourage, reach out and give back in positive ways
    to the communities from which they came, and with corporate and individual donations,
    assist in providing access to a variety of support services for the children like Kiesha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <a href="http://www.tnt.org">National Trust for the
    Development of African American Men's Prison Project</a> supports families of inmates
    involved with their human resource development training, and provides computers for
    training labs in prisons which are used by guards and inmates alike. Future projects
    include video e-mail, on-line homework and online visitation via DSL services through
    community centers in the cities where the families reside. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
