    communities to the growing cities. The burgeoning Technological Revolution can lure people
    back to the country-side -- or isolate rural communities from the rest of the world. </font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>Development in Rural America</big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The four major areas of rural development -- economic
    growth, education, public health and safety, and community -- are each greatly affected by
    technology and communications policy.</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Everybody's Business</b> -- The traditional businesses
    of rural communities have been farms, retail stores, manufacturing plants, and companies
    that harvest natural resources such as coal and timber. The strength of these businesses
    determine the financial health of the families and local governments of rural communities.
    Rural businesses are facing challenges getting the basic things they need to thrive:
    access to capital (such as low-interest loans or a reduction of taxes);
    &quot;infra-structure&quot; (such basic public utilities as roads, electricity, telephone
    services, and, increasingly, high-speed data lines); educated and skilled employees; and a
    generally supportive business environment (such as through locally supported business
    parks, eco-tourism, or resources for alternative agriculture.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Learning Curve</b>&nbsp; -- Fewer businesses and
    property-owners in rural communities mean fewer tax dollars for public education. Some of
    the challenges include maintaining the quality of K-12 schools (such as through teacher
    recruitment and retention, provision of books and other teaching aids, diversity of
    subject matter, and ongoing teacher certification); vocational training for viable rural
    businesses; and life-long learning for adults.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Safety Net</b> -- Basic health and public safety
    services taken for granted by most of the country are also at risk in rural communities.
    Providing medical care is complicated by the challenges of recruiting and retaining
    qualified medical professionals and securing necessary equipment and supplies. Public
    safety is hampered by few funds for police, fire, and emergency medical technicians -- and
    servicing large geographic areas. Rural communities lack many of the social services
    offered in urban areas such as low-income housing for families, food subsidies, and job
    training and networking.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Community Pride</b> -- Small towns are often assumed to
    be models of community, but the reverse is often true. While rural areas may experience
    more civic participation, the primary sources of information are urban-focused television
    and radio stations, print media, and, increasingly, Internet services.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>Special Technology/Telecommunications Issues in
    Rural Communities</big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Basic Telephony</b> -- The
    quality of telephone service is usually worse in rural areas than in urban or suburban
    communities. Line availability and service are both haphazard. Multiple small phone
    companies serve localized rural areas -- which means expensive &quot;long distance&quot;
    calls over relatively short distances.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Universal Service</b> -- Much of the state and federal
    telephone taxes are re-invested with the telecommunications companies through
    &quot;universal service&quot; programs in four ways: (a) subsidizing telephone lines in
    &quot;high cost&quot; rural areas, (b) subsidizing telephone connections and services for
    poor families, (c) connecting schools and libraries to the internet (through the Schools
    and Libraries Division), and (d) connecting rural health services through the Internet
    (with the Rural Health Care Division). All four programs have come under fire from both
    the industry and from some federal legislators.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications</b>, or <b>Digital
    Access -- </b>The &quot;digital revolution&quot; means that different forms of
    communication (telephone, television, and computer information) can use the same pathways,
    typically fiber optic cables. Since an actual fiber optic cable must be physically strung
    from point to point, low-density areas of the country are not profitable to telecom
    companies. Whereas the telephone network and the interstate highways were subsidized by
    state and federal governments, the evolving high-speed telecommunications network is not.
    The result is a great deal of &quot;over-building&quot; in metropolitan areas -- and few
    &quot;pipelines&quot; in rural areas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Wireless telephone service</b>, or cellular, is a
    workable alternative to wireline telephone service in extremely rural areas. However,
    wireless companies do not receive the same kind of universal service subsidies, the FCC
    regulates the spectrum that these wireless services use, and many local communities charge
    local tower siting fees.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Local cable television franchises</b> can require
    operators to provide public, educational, and governmental (PEG) access funding, equipment
    and facilities; high-speed &quot;institutional network' or &quot;I-nets&quot;; and
    Internet access in exchange for the use of local rights-of-way and easements. However,
    various federal laws and court decisions have affected what local communities can request
    as compensation. Plus, recent mergers of traditional cable television companies are
    blurring the lines between the services that may be regulated by local and state
    authorities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Direct broadcast satellite (DBS) </b>serve homes,
    farms, and businesses outside the loop of cable television and on the fringe of broadcast
    signals. Originally, DBS companies (such as PrimeStar) were barred from providing local
    broadcast programming. However, Congress is currently allowing the re-broadcast of some
    &quot;local&quot; television stations under specific conditions. But the term
    &quot;local&quot; is used loosely since the closest TV station may be scores of miles away
    geographically -- and would be unlikely to cover the events and issues of small towns
    outside its primary signal area. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Federal and state public technology program
    appropriations</b> for information technology may be the only way some rural communities
    can get connected. Several federal funding programs need ongoing citizen support to fend
    off proposed cuts: the Department of Commerce's &quot;Telecommunications and Information
    Infrastructure Assistance Program&quot; (TIIAP), the Department of Education's Community
    Technology Center grants, the Federal Communications Commission's Schools and Libraries
    Division and Rural Health Care Division funds, and various Department of Agriculture
    programs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Community technology centers</b> are often the only
    ways rural small businesses and families can get access to the Internet. In most cases,
    metropolitan areas have local dial-in access, both residential and commercial high-speed
    telephone lines, access through cable television, and even satellite access. Rural areas
    are usually limited in these options.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>Rural Signposts and Way Stations</big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Keeping up with changes in information technology and
    communications can be a difficult task. And understanding the different levels and aspects
    of public policy can be confusing. But citizen involvement in making policy and directing
    technology is critical for rural development. Fortunately, many organizations and
    individuals are dedicated to making technology and communication policy work for rural
    communities. (See the list of &quot;<a href="rural_public_policy_resources.htm">Rural
    Resources on the Web</a>.&quot;) However, more active local involvement is critical in
    shaping the public policy that can bring the &quot;Technological Revolution&quot; to all
    people -- and help rural America become more economically stable, better educated, safe
    and secure, and more equitable, and support truly livable communities. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
