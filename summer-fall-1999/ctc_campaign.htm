    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Computer and Internet skills are becoming
    more critical in today's job market. The economy depends more on information technology
    &#151; and job re-training has become a national priority. For poor families, Community
    Technology Centers (CTCs) are a key venue for learning these important vocational skills
    as well as gaining computer experience and literacy through a variety of programs.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Fortunately, the U.S. Department of Education
    has recognized this and $10 million was allocated for the CTC program in 1999. According
    to Norris E. Dickard, who manages the program, which is housed in the Office of Vocational
    and Adult Education, the Department of Ed is planning on awarding forty to fifty grants of
    between $75,000 and $300,000 to community-based technology centers. The timeline between
    the announcement for a &quot;request for proposals (RFP),&quot; and the proposal deadline
    is tight (April 22- June 14). </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Clinton Administration has proposed
    increasing the budget for CTC vocational training in the 2000 budget to $65 million &#150;
    but Congress must first approve this dramatic increase. Funding CTCs was one of the 1999
    budget priorities of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). Thanks to the leadership of
    Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA), then chair of the CBC, Congress approved the $10
    million grant program. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    &quot;Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies
    Appropriations&quot; bill. The U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee has
    already had a hearing on the bill. Tight caps on discretionary spending have already put
    this CTC funding in jeopardy. Rather than voting on the budget for the Department of
    Education and other vulnerable agencies, Congress has approved a &quot;continuing
    resolution&quot; to postpone budgetary approval. Republicans are using this tactic to
    break President Clinton's budget caps.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">To ensure inclusion of the full amount in the
    appropriations bill, a Coalition of organizations and individuals have mobilized to
    conduct research, prepare educational materials, and lobby Members of Congress. The
    Coalition has already lobbied key U.S. Representatives and Senators&#151;and was
    successful in getting a handful of Members to mention the funds in their letters of
    support for specific agency budgets. The Coalition has targeted CTCs in specific
    Congressional districts to encourage their Members of Congress to support this program. On
    May 25th, the Coalition hosted a Congressional site visit to a Washington, DC area CTC,
    the Gateway at Edgewood Terrace. To learn more about this and other policy initiatives,
    you can subscribe to a new electronic discussion list by sending a message to <a href="mailto:lyris@ombwatch.org">lyris@ombwatch.org</a> , leaving the subject line blank.

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is only one example of how CTCs and
    their supporters can be engaged in shaping public policy that is beneficial to the people
    they serve. The coalition will be exploring ways to create an on-going strategy and
    program to keep CTCs engaged in public policy at the federal, state, and local levels.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Your involvement is critical in taking
    advantage of the tremendous window of opportunity for funding and policy that is now open.
    For the first time, Congress actually stated for the record that school and library access
    to the Internet was a part of &quot;universal service.&quot; The combination of the
    Telecommunications Act of 1996 and greater public awareness of the Internet has created a
    flood of funding and policy opportunities that will last only as long as the technology
    and telecommunications firms continue to focus on their own merger frenzy. Partners,
    alliances, and coalitions must be established now to build sustainable funding and
    supportive policies for the future.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Creating a community technology, networking,
    and media public policy program is the right thing to do. Only we can do it the right way.
    And we need to do it right now. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
