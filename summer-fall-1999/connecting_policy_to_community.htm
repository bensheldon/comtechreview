    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">For grassroots groups working to ensure
    access to affordable technology at the local level, the complex and frequently confusing
    telecommunications policy debates taking place at the state and national level might seem
    very remote. It's a daunting enough task putting people together with computers and
    keeping the doors open. Making time to understand and speak out on convoluted regulatory
    issues is, understandably, a low priority for people who are working to ensure that
    everyone in our communities has access to technology.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But the outcome of those high-stakes policy
    debates is going to determine who ultimately has access to what technology. So it is
    important to understand the policy debate because sooner or later it will impact the
    programs in our communities.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="518" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">By now, it is apparent to almost everyone who uses a telephone that
    the much-touted Telecommunications Act of 1996 hasn't produced the results Congress was
    looking for. Instead of competition, we have mergers. Instead of lowering the cost of
    services, we are seeing price rises in everything from basic phone service to cable and
    Internet access. In most communities, residential phone customers are no closer to having
    a choice of service providers than they were three years ago.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Consumer advocacy organizations like the
    Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, and state-based Citizens Utility Boards
    have researched the legal and economic issues, and argued the consumers' case in formal
    regulatory proceedings. But their resources are limited, their opponents' pockets are
    deep, and they don't always have the &quot;people power&quot; to demonstrate widespread
    support for their positions. That's where our community-based groups can make a
    difference. By speaking out in support of consumer needs, we can help to ensure that the
    benefits of structural changes in the telecommunications industry don't stop at the door
    to the corporate board room, but reach all the way into the neglected corners of our
    communities.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Right now, there is an important decision
    pending where community groups can make a difference &#151; the proposed takeover of
    Ameritech by SBC. The Illinois Commerce Commission, as well as the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC), are weighing the pros and cons through late June. By voicing our support
    for consumer positions, we can make a difference.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are lots of reasons why the merger is a
    bad idea. SBC has a reputation for being the most anticompetitive of the Regional Bell
    Operating Companies (RBOCs) and has vigorously opposed efforts to ensure that savings from
    takeovers are passed on to consumers. Also, the company's track record after previous
    takeovers has been poor.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the merger is approved, it will have
    immediate impacts in the regions where SBC and Ameritech provide service. But over time,
    it will also affect telecommunications services &#151; including affordable access to
    technology &#151; in the rest of the country. Like the telecommunications infrastructure
    itself, it's all connected.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">If the FCC does approve the merger, public
    interest groups have recommended that the approval be subject to various conditions
    intended to promote increased access to telecommunications services, including information
    technology.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Benton Foundation and OMB Watch have
    recommended that approval of the merger be subject to conditions which would help close
    the &quot;digital divide,&quot; prevent delays in bringing high-bandwidth services to
    low-income communities, as well as increase the number of households receiving basic
    telephone service.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Illinois Citizens Utility Board (CUB) and
    other consumer groups are recommending that the merger be subject to a requirement that
    local phone service be opened to competition. Long distance companies are asking that
    federal access charges be significantly reduced, with the savings passed on to consumers.
    These access charges cost consumers more than $15 billion annually, and reducing them
    would help promote local phone competition in addition to saving consumers money.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The consumer arguments have been made. In
    cases like this, a letter, a phone call, or an email message to key decision makers can be
    helpful.</font></p>

    you read this, comments can be emailed directly to the FCC Commissioners at the following
