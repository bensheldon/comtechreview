    Community technology activists are caught in the position of both defending the e-rate
    program and being among its major critics. We share a commitment to its
    defense&#151;witness Tony Wilhelm's &quot;E-Rate: Don't Let the Flame Expire,&quot; in
    Digital Voices, 24 May 1999&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.benton.org/DigitalVoices">www.benton.org/DigitalVoices</a>);
    we need to grasp its restrictions and limitations. The following exchange reflects an
    important critique of those limitations.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman"><a href="mailto:dave@oldcolo.com">David
    Hughes</a></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The <i>Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph</i>
    newspaper ran a story on March 17th, &quot;School Internet Aid at Risk&quot; in which
    Congressman Tom Tancredo (R - Littleton) has introduced legislation to kill the $2.25
    Billion Universal Service Fund 'e-rate' subsidy for schools and libraries connectivity to
    the Internet. School District 11 got $1.8 million this year. Tancredo said it is an
    example of 'rash Federal spending.'</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Well, I agree with him -- but for entirely
    different reasons.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">First off that fund was originally designed
    to subsidize rural, 'high cost' and poorest school districts and libraries, such as those
    in the San Luis Valley of Colorado, where a T-1 Internet line between Alamosa, the closest
    Internet connection, and the tiny town of San Luis costs over $1,700 a month, while the
    same capability -- because of shorter distances -- costs as little as $200 a month in
    Colorado Springs. So the first question is -- do the big urban Denver and Colorado Springs
    school districts need such a subsidy, while can the 14 tiny districts in the poorest
    counties of Colorado remain connected at such high costs without the subsidy? There are
    places that e-rate is needed.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But the second point even more questions the
    Congressional oversight, and FCC administration of the program and funds. Tancredo could
    fix those problems, without throwing out the baby schools with the e-rate bath.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There is list of eligible costs that e-rate
    funds can pay for. A new list was issued yesterday. The telephone companies made sure, by
    lobbying, it could only be used to pay for commercial 'services' outside the schools. i.e.
    the money flows back to the telephone company. NOT eligible, is the right of the schools
    to purchase and install, on a one-time basis, either microwave systems or digital radio
    systems which will do the same thing US West lines will do to connect schools and
    libraries, but cost nothing each month, for service, thereafter.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">This is not idle talk. I spent the last three
    years demonstrating, as an Investigator for the National Science Foundation how schools
    and libraries could use off the shelf advanced communications technologies, rural and
    urban, at the lowest long term cost to taxpayers or rate payers. In fact I connected up
    two large District 11 schools, Coronado and Mitchell, and one branch library of the Pikes
    Peak Library District to test the radios and prove their worth. The $1.8 million received
    by District 11 would have bought an even newer $3,500 radio, installed, for every one of
    its 55 schools, which would link them 7 times faster than US West's T-1 lines could do it.
    At Ethernet speeds. And just, or even more, reliably than telephone lines. With no monthly
    costs, e-rate or no e-rate.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Its only going to get better, and cheaper. To
    the point all students and teachers from home could be connected to their school's
    resources, at no monthly cost.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One large local district -- District 20 -- 3
    years before e-rate came along, connected up its 25 separate schools this way, including
    Microwave, out of their own budget. And are saving over $2.3 million ($12,000 a month)
    over a US West bid solution over the first 10 years.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">But when the FCC made the stupid rules under
    pressure from the phone companies, and Congress did not override them, no local schools or
    the library district with its 10 branches could apply for the e-rate to make such one time
    expenditures, and get Internet connected between schools, and to the nearst Internet
    service, forever, high speed and free.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So they went for the Washington 'free lunch'
    instead. And they must ask for an e-rate grant every year for the connection between their
    schools and the Internet until the end of time.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">So where does that Universal Service Fund
    money, collected on your phone bill every month go? Why right back into US West's pockets.
    Where else did you think it went? That's what's really 'rash' about the e-rate. And
    neither Congress, nor Representative Tancredo have done anything to correct such a rash
    set of rules by the FCC, which only benefits US West's stockholders by selling schools a
    service they don't need from telephone companies, when they should be able to buy radios
    from any of 70 American companies which are being used daily by corporations, government,
    and the US military. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    Grunwald</font></a></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">There are many flaws to the e-rate. Dave
    Hughes has focused in on the way one particular ox (wireless) has been gored. So, this
    piece makes sense as a critique of the regs and as an exposé of the hypocrisy of the
    telecos (some say that they turned against the e-rate when they discovered that a large
    percentage of funds was going to wiring schools and not back into the telcos' pockets as
    service fees). It's a strong argument because it shows how the program has been skewed by
    the self-interest of the telcos.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">More globally, the e-rate has diverted
    attention from the principle of universal service by zeroing in on one aspect of the
    digital divide&#151;mainly K-12 schools and pretending that addressing that need is *the*
    answer to the universal service challenge in the information age. It's an effort to
    convince us that we can shine up a muddy car by adding new windshield wiper fluid. We need
    the whole car wash.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">In doing this, the worst thing about the
    e-rate is that it divides the natural universal service constituencies into
    &quot;haves&quot; (schools with high % of children eligible for school lunch program,
    libraries, &amp; rural health centers) and &quot;have-nots&quot; (every other public
    interest group from nonprofits to community colleges to CTCs and even to health centers in
    rural areas that don't meet the eligibility requirements). It pits these groups against
    each other, undermines the possibility for community-wide collaborations, and makes the
    e-rate itself with all its flaws (not universal service) the issue.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">One concern about focusing on wireless is the
    danger of falling into the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; trap in another way. The issue
    is not solely one for rural, high-cost areas but Universal Service as a principle. The
    e-rate IS needed in underfunded inner city schools and the issue shouldn't get framed as a
    rural vs. urban one &#151; although the disadvantages of rural areas are real and should
    receive special attention.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, the e-rate also doesn't address the
    fact that the Internet is fundamentally different from utilities covered by the old
    universal service model. With the steep learning curve for technology, there are now
    significant &quot;barriers to use&quot; as well as &quot;barriers to access.&quot; The
    studies now coming out about the need for teacher training underscore this issue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Universal service needs to be broadly defined. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
