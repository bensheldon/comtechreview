    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The discussion of community technology access issues has
    grown in breadth and, in the minds of an increasing number of people, importance in the
    past five years. In this debate, which resonates from the halls of Congress to the
    corridors of public libraries and schools across America, low-income people have
    determined that they must establish their stake in the community technology access debate.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="522" colspan="3"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is becoming increasingly evident, say these residents, that the
    issues surrounding community technology access are critical to sustainable communities and
    economic self-sufficiency.</font><font size="3"><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If
    you study newspapers and magazine articles over the past four years, it's clear that
    technology access as a public policy, cultural, and economic development issue has become
    of greater public interest. The many factors that have stimulated this heightened interest
    -- the application of technology in information management and strategic planning
    undergirding the longest economic boom in human history, the obliteration, transformation
    and establishment of entire new industries driven and managed by technology tools, the
    emergence of the Internet as an information transport medium, and the approach of the new
    millennium have all influenced a public just now recognizing how much of an impact
    technology is having in reinventing society and culture itself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As with any resource development phenomenon, issues of
    equity are being raised. Will all citizens have access to the tools and knowledge of the
    new technologies? Or will these resources be allocated and available according to income,
    education, or ability to use and manipulate them?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Technology has emerged from the back rooms of gee-whiz
    rocket science applications into the mainstream because for the first time in history --
    in this transitional period when new technologies are created, destroyed, reinvented,
    reinterpreted and redeployed -- we can see the impact of technology-based tools on how we
    work, how we live, whom we are connected to, how we manage information, and how we
    perceive society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the last decade, there has emerged a &quot;wired&quot;
    culture, a group of power players who are connected worldwide to the centers of commerce,
    education, planning, and communication via the Internet and other technology-driven tools.
    These people -- who are traditionally the educational, economic and cultural elite -- deal
    and communicate with each other worldwide and are making the choices that impact others.
    It's expected now that people will bank, file their taxes, do their research, transmit and
    interpret information via online resources.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Studies by MCI, the Department of Commerce, the Benton
    Foundation, Vanderbilt University, MIT and other scholarly and governmental institutions
    have shown that residents of low-income communities are disconnected from this world and
    the transactions made in them because they don't have access to the tools and the
    knowledge of how to use them. Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich's fear of a
    two-tiered society of technology masters and technology illiterates is coming to reality
    if these studies are accurate.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>How Residents Interpret Community Technology
    Access</big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the days before the Internet, universal access meant
    having a telephone. (In fact, according to Ellis Jacobs of the Ohio Telecommunications
    Alliance, about 20% of low-income residents don't have a phone or can't afford minimal
    telephone features.)</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now access has taken on an entirely new definition: access
    not only to the Internet, but to a pager, cellular phone, voice mail, and computer. It can
    reasonably be inferred that if one does not have access to all of these technology tools,
    then one might just be out of the &quot;loop&quot; in today's information-driven society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Technology advances used to occur gradually over a period
    of years; now new technologies become obsolescent and reborn/redeveloped within months.
    The introduction of new technologies continually raises the bar on what people see as
    minimally acceptable technology: for example, ten years ago a text-based interface was
    state of the art, but now few customers would buy a computer that did not feature
    multi-media with voice, data, sound, and graphics. So as technology advances raise the bar
    of expectations on what is considered minimally acceptable as &quot;technology&quot;
    access, this also changes the value bar of technology access. There are two questions:
    What level of technology is acceptable as &quot;community technology access&quot;? What
    level of technology is acceptable to achieve &quot;universal technology access&quot;?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Communities that are seen as low-income and underserved
    are particularly sensitive to these kinds of discussions because they perceive, and
    rightly so, we think, that technology developers create technology as market driven
    assets. Because technology is most often positioned as a marketable product offered at
    various levels of affordability, residents are concerned as to whether they can afford
    those costs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whether technology access is in fact a property right is
    really a public policy issue, but we know residents in low-income areas generally feel
    that access to technology should not be determined by income levels, but by how important
    this access is to being a functioning citizen in society.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">They have begun to see their access to technology as a
    civil right. That means the focus should be on the levels of acceptable technology access
    and how to deliver technology to those who are unable to pay for that.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Whose responsibility is it to support universal access?</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How universal access will be paid for is the crux of the
    debate surrounding the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Most observers
    agree that guaranteeing universal access means that at least some segments of society will
    need to be subsidized in order to receive access. The act mandates the creation of a
    universal fund to support discounted telecommunications services for schools and
    libraries; significantly, support for non-profit and community-based organizations was
    excluded. This omission becomes an issue for residents and community-based organizations
    because there are many more non-profit organizations than schools and libraries.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Technology Access As A Public and Civil Right</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are some resources that are seen as fundamental to
    citizens and therefore as a matter of public policy provided as a public right. Public
    education, for example, is seen as a fundamental right of citizens because it is in the
    national interest for all citizens to receive minimal levels of knowledge and achieve
    minimal levels of educational efficiency. Similarly, public transportation and public
    protection (through the military and national guard) were provided as similar resources.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some policymakers argue that technology access should have
    this same status. In the context of citizens rights, community technology access is being
    framed as one of these fundamental rights.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>Part Three: Recommendations</big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Following are some draft recommendations for
    implementation strategies for community technology access which have been developed from
    conversations with community residents and staff of community-based agencies.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      </font><font size="3"><p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Universal access should be
      declared a public right.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Technology education should be required in schools.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Technology training should be connected to
      school-to-work initiatives.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. School and CBO-based community computing centers should
      be established.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. Libraries should develop subsidized community computing
      centers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Subsidized technology training should be available to
      low-income residents.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">7. A goal of a 1 to 4 computer-resident ratio should be
      established in low-income communities.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. Residents should organize and support their own
      community access and training networks that focus on low-income residents.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">9. Connectivity between agencies, residents and
      neighborhoods should be a basic part of city services provided to all residents.</font></p>
      </font>

    policy statement of the Neighborhood Technology Access Council, a Chicago-based advocacy
    and policy group in formation for more than two years. It is intended to be a draft
    working document that stimulates discussion, defines some issues, and codifies some
    suggestions about how community residents view the issue of community technology access
    and how they would like to see access to technology expanded in their own communities.</font></p>
