    is a new social and electronic community network developed to serve the largely rural
    Cambria County, including the City of Johnstown - a city still officially defined by the
    Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as economically distressed -- and soon ten counties of rural
    and urban southwest central Pennsylvania. Thanks to start-up funding from a Commonwealth
    of Pennsylvania Link-to-Learn Infrastructure Development Award, CAN is launching during
    the spring and summer of 1999.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">CAN seeks to reduce resource and information fragmentation
    and other barriers to progress by connecting citizens to economic and community
    development tools and resources for individual growth. This network is free to the public
    and is accessible through any computer linked to the Internet (at home, in the office, at
    school, in libraries, in senior citizen and community centers, and at two CAN Community
    Responsibility Centers). The network leverages community resources (including businesses,
    schools, government, neighborhoods, and individuals) in order to facilitate individual
    growth, community and economic development, and other positive social change via computer
    technology and social interaction.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Development of the CAN project has been ongoing since June
    1998. During the past eleven months, work has been focused on developing community based
    information resources. Consequently, we have already developed a high community profile
    and important stakeholders across many social constituencies. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In October 1998, and January and March 1999, we held
    numerous prototype review sessions at our Civic Responsibility Center site in downtown
    Johnstown. The prototype review sessions provided a large number of individuals from
    across the region with a preview of the Electronic Volunteer Center, the Electronic
    Community Calendar, and the Electronic Community Resource Directory. Following the
    sessions, we scheduled on-line pilot tests of these database components, working with a
    manageable number of organizations to test the functionalities and user friendliness of
    the database. Participating piloting partners entered real data into the database and
    carefully maintained detailed workbooks to chronicle their experience with the database
    entries. Immediately after the pilot test periods, we met again with each of the piloting
    partners to gather feedback allowing us to identify and fix database errors and other
    problems, and allowing us to gather suggestions for improving the site. By April 1999, we
    had held approximately 45 public sessions to guide database development. Collectively,
    these sessions involved approximately 450 individuals from across a wide spectrum of
    community infrastructure. This approach to knowledge engineering has proved to be
    invaluable to the project, and it has resulted in a high-quality, powerful, and very
    sophisticated database that represents a significant tool to support economic and
    community development as well as to support personal development for citizens in the
    region.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>Where Are We Right Now?</big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rapid prototype product production we have followed
    has been extraordinarily ambitious. The database is almost complete; however, it is not
    yet ready for a public release. </font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have important work to finish related, for example, to
    developing database documentation, policy manuals, fixing java script errors, adjusting
    screen language, reviewing and changing site flow, and several other very important
    database functionalities. We are currently working to develop a time-effort-cost plan for
    completing the design work that remains, and to complete the planning needed for opening
    (in June) the Civic Responsibility Center public lab in Johnstown and the Community
    Resource Center site at NORCAM in Barnesboro. These sites will serve as free public access
    labs and places where people can receive training and support for using the CAN database.
    CAN is also affiliated with existing programs that offer at least an additional 75 free
    public access computers in community libraries, public housing projects, neighborhood
    community centers, and in area schools. </font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>Public Launch Coming Soon</big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This summer CAN will first launch a sophisticated
    searchable Electronic Community Calendar and a county-wide Electronic Community Yellow
    Pages catalog of business and community services listings. Soon after the first launch,
    the CAN will deploy a sophisticated Electronic Volunteer Center, the first of its kind in
    the region, allowing volunteers to identify opportunities and service-learning experiences
    that meet both their needs and the needs of the community. Later in the summer, we will
    also deploy a powerful on-line interactive Electronic Community Services Directory, which
    is based on a nationally recognized typology of community services. Plans for the second
    year of growth include the development of a robust academic internship opportunities
    database.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
