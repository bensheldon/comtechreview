    <td valign="top" width="296"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><a href="mailto:lharris@lharris.com"><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Leslie Harris</font></a><font size="3"><p><font face="Times New Roman">In recent months, newspapers have been full of stories about the
    promise of broadband. Every week, a new corporate telecommunications megamerger is
    announced with the promise of ubiquitous, always on, broadband connections to millions of
    Americans. But community networks and community technology centers need to look beyond the
    hype. Because, as cities around the country have found out (see sidebar), industry plans
    for broadband may build the bottom line but they may not serve the public interest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most folks seem to agree that ubiquitous access to
    broadband will transform the Internet and bring new educational opportunities, health
    services, cultural information, and civic opportunities to our communities. The very
    nature of the Internet is changing before our eyes: just a few years ago, the vast
    majority of Internet content was pure text; today, bandwidth-intensive graphics play an
    increasingly important role. And while a picture may say a thousand words, a picture uses
    an awful lot more bandwidth. Add streaming video and audio, along with java applets and
    other emerging technologies, and community demand for bandwidth will soar. And service
    providers are talking the right talk, saying they'll deliver on the promise of broadband
    &quot;any day now.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But for those who care about the public interest, there
    are hard questions that must be asked: Broadband for whom? At what cost? And with what
    restrictions? Right now, the deployment of both digital subscriber lines (DSL) and cable
    broadband give cause for concern, as some phone and most cable companies attempt to
    control both the content and conduit that reaches the home over high speed. This trend is
    becoming more and more apparent, as cable and phone companies and their affiliated
    Internet service providers (ISPs) seek to become gatekeepers to high speed pipes by using
    their own portals and search engines to control how users access the Internet and at the
    same time keeping other Internet service providers off of their high speed networks
    altogether, either by closing the system outright or pricing competitors out of the
    market. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Low cost community ISPs, regional ISPs, and unaffiliated
    national services will be unable to provide their customers with high speed broadband
    access unless the consumer pays twice: once for the affiliated ISP and then again for the
    preferred provider. Even then, the broadband companies' affiliated ISPs will set the terms
    and conditions of service. As one commenter observed, &quot;whatever this is, it isn't the
    Internet.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For the community network community, the broadband
    transition presents a host of issues, not the least of which is how to bring broadband to
    the communities they serve. Recent reports have indicated that the digital divide is
    closing, as the cost of computers and Internet access has continued to decline. But if a
    few giant gatekeepers control access to broadband, the digital divide may become an abyss.
    As has happened before, major monopolies have no plans to bring services to lower income
    communities because they view these consumers as reduced revenue sources. Cable providers
    such as AT&amp;T Broadband Services (formerly TCI), for example, plan to bundle broadband
    with phone and cable service and offer that package exclusively to so-called &quot;high
    end&quot; customers. Not only are they failing to upgrade the cable pipes in lower income
    areas for broadband, they wont let anyone else -- such as community-based ISPs -- use the
    existing cable infrastructure to offer broadband services in these &quot;redlined&quot;
    communities (See &quot;<a href="http://www.civilrightsforum.org/TCI.htm">Halt Called for
    AT&amp;T-TCI Merger Until TCI Non-Compliance and Civil Rights Record Examined</a>,&quot;
    ). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">What's more, as community networks shift from merely
    providing access to providing ever increasing amounts of local and community oriented
    content, there is a very real danger that broadband gatekeepers will push users away from
    &quot;free&quot; community resources to similar, commercially affiliated sites. The
    business strategy of broadband service providers like @Home is built around steering
    customers to the web sites of commercial partners through the provider's caching server,
    portal, search tools, and web hotlists. Without the financial resources necessary to
    partner with a nationwide broadband Internet service provider, the quality content and
    services offered by community networks and other civic and nonprofit institutions will
    largely be bypassed in the broadband world. Much like towns left behind by the interstate
    highway system in the 50s, nonprofit content sites bypassed by the broadband service
    provider are likely to find it hard to attract hits and may be relegated to relative
    obscurity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Finally, if broadband access is controlled by a handful of
    gatekeepers, the open environment, which allows free expression and diversity to flourish
    on the Internet, may be put at risk. In a gatekeeper mediated Internet, the company's ISP
    can decide how extensive your Internet access should be. Already, TCI@Home has tried to
    prevent its subscribers from using the broadband connection for any business-related
    purpose, even checking e-mail. @Home's service agreement also limits the amount of video
    that can be down-streamed, and restricts the ability of subscribers to use certain
    Internet protocols. Not only can a gatekeeper limit what you can do on the Internet, it
    can exert extraordinary &quot;editorial control&quot; over content, selecting the
    information that is placed on its portal, limiting the subject matter and the discussions
    in chatrooms, censoring the content of personal web pages, placing restrictions on e-mail
    or even limiting the sites that may be accessed on the Internet altogether. The point is
    not that any particular company has or is likely to engage in such tactics, but that in an
    environment where competition is eliminated, such practices are possible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fortunately, there is a relatively simple solution -- a
    requirement that broadband service providers provide nondiscriminatory access and pricing
    to all interested Internet service providers. That's what Portland has ordered AT&amp;T
    Broadband Services to do and that's what consumers in Seattle, Los Angeles, and Dallas
    among others, have asked their cities to do as well. Even some states have begun to look
    at requiring open broadband. In Washington, DC, ISPs and public interest groups have asked
    the Federal Communications Commission to mandate open access for broadband providers, and
    Congress has begun to explore the issue with hearings and legislation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Internet was never intended to be a medium controlled
    by a few giant gatekeepers. Competition has spurred new services and new technologies and
    made the Internet affordable and democratic. The fight to keep the Internet open as
    broadband is deployed is far from over, however, and community networks need to get
    involved. If you'd like to learn more about the deployment of broadband services and how
    you can help, see the <a href="http://www.nogatekeepers.org">No Gatekeepers</a> coalition

    the Country</small></font><b></h2>
    <p></b><small>The open access to broadband issue has become one of the hottest technology
    issues in the country. Here's a quick summary of what's going on:</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Congress</small></font><b></h3>
    <p></b><small>Both the House and the Senate have been looking at the broadband issue in
    recent months. In the Senate, the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on the
    development of broadband on April 13, 1999. There were strong industry voices both for and
    against open broadband, but the voices of consumers and communities were not included in
    this hearing, although Sen. McCain promised to hold a future hearing to discuss issues of
    concern to those communities. That follow up hearing has not yet been scheduled.</small></p>
    <p><small>In the House of Representatives, Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Rick Boucher
    (D-VA) have jointly introduced legislation to force all broadband providers, regardless of
    the technology used, to provide open access if it is technically feasible and can be done
    in an economically reasonable fashion. The legislation also allows phone companies to
    avoid some regulation if they deploy DSL services. Their bills, HR 1685 and HR 1686, have
    been referred to the Commerce and Judiciary Committees but no hearings have yet been
    scheduled.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Federal Communications Commission </small></font><b></h3>
    <p></b><small>On January 28, the FCC released a Report to Congress dealing with the
    deployment of broadband services to the public. This document, which was required by
    Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, said that the FCC believed that
    broadband services deployment were proceeding well. It also stated that because the
    broadband industry was still in its infancy, regulation to deal with problems such as the
    open access issue would be premature. The FCC's decision has put off the issue of open
    access to broadband networks for the time being. Several articles in the trade press have
    roundly criticized the FCC, pointing out that failure to act could well strangle small
    Internet service providers (ISPs) and deny consumers choice and a competitive marketplace.
    </small></p>
    <p><small>In February, the FCC approved the merger of AT&amp;T and TCI without imposing
    any open access requirements. Shortly thereafter, AT&amp;T announced that it would be
    purchasing the nation's third largest cable company, MediaOne. Assuming it passes
    regulatory muster, that acquisition will make AT&amp;T the largest cable company in the
    United States. Obviously, this concentration of media power in the hands of one company is
    sure to bring the open access issue back to the fore.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Texas</small></font><b></h3>
    <p></b><small>At the state level, Texas has actively been pursuing open access to cable
    and DSL services. In the House, HB 3339 was introduced by Rep. Kim Brimer on April 26,
    1999, to require nondiscriminatory access by all wireline broadband service providers
    throughout Texas. It is currently pending before the State Affairs Committee. On the
    Senate side, an identical bill (SB 1743) had been introduced by Sen. Chris Harris. SB 1743
    was referred to the subcommittee on Technology and Business on March 15, 1999. Neither
    bill has had hearings yet.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>California</small></font><b></h3>
    <p></b><small>On January 7, 1999, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)
    decided not to force incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to provide shared access to
    local phone lines. Instead, ISPs and CLECs selling DSL service must lease a second,
    separate phone line into the home in order to provide DSL services -- effectively
    increasing the cost for competitors and their consumers. In February, Representative Lou
    Papan introduced AB 991 in the State Assembly in order to force ILECs to share phone lines
    for DSL services. The bill was re-referred to the Committee on Appropriations on April 28,
    1999.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Portland and Multnomah County<b> </small></font></h3>
    <p></b><small>Portland was the first city to openly condition its approval of the
    AT&amp;T/TCI merger on the opening of the cable broadband network to competitive Internet
    service providers. The open access position was supported by a number of organizations,
    including the Oregon Internet Service Providers' Association, Oregon Consumer League,
    Citizen's Utility Board, and Oregon Public Internet Research Group. After talks between
    the city of Portland and Multnomah County, on the one hand, and AT&amp;T and TCI, on the
    other, fell apart in early December, the Portland City Council and Multnomah County Board
    of County Commissioners voted to condition their approval of the merger on opening the
    network. After several weeks, AT&amp;T and TCI rejected the conditioned approval, and
    lawyers for Portland rejected the merger. AT&amp;T and TCI promptly filed suit. The matter
    is currently in the courts, although a compromise solution may be reached.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Seattle and King County<b> </b></small></font></h3>
    <p><small>Just as the fight in Portland was heating up, the issue took center stage in
    Seattle and King County. The issue of Seattle's approval of the AT&amp;T/TCI merger was
    complicated by the long history of poor service by TCI in the area. Both King County and
    the city of Seattle watched the example of Portland and began to make moves towards
    conditioning their approval of the merger on open access, supported by a broad coalition
    of Internet Service Providers, consumers, and others. As one editorial put it, Seattle
    should &quot;Join [the] Anti-TCI Coalition.&quot; As the fight over the approval of the
    merger unfolded, the open cable access issue became the centerpiece of Seattle's efforts
    to improve cable on behalf of its citizens and consumers. On February 8, the city of
    Seattle released a tentative agreement with TCI and AT&amp;T, under which they would not
    mandate open access but would reserve the right to do so in the future. Also on February
    8, several members of the King County Board of Commissioners put out a press release in
    which they openly came out in favor of requiring access in King County. Both Seattle and
    King County voted to approve the merger, subject to a study on open access, on February
    16, 1999</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Spokane </small></font></h3>
    <p><small>Spokane also dealt with the open broadband issue, although somewhat less
    directly than Seattle and Portland. A competitive service provider had already asked TCI
    to allow open access to the network using the leased access rules. Because of the
    uncertain jurisdictions in the AT&amp;T/TCI merger case, the city attorney cautioned the
    city against requiring open access. In the end, the city council approved the merger Ð
    but attached a resolution cautioning AT&amp;T Broadband Services to tread softly since the
    city council would be monitoring the progress of competition in the market and could
    revisit the issue in the future. Since that warning, the competitive service provider
    seeking to use leased access, IVI, has been denied access to the cable network by
    AT&amp;T. Following several petititons by IVI, the city attorney decided that the open
    broadband issue needed to be addressed by the FCC.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Los Angeles </small></font></h3>
    <p><small>In Los Angeles, after a spirited fight, the City Council approved the
    TCI/AT&amp;T merger on January 26, 1999. However, they also mandated that a study be done
    on how the city could implement open access for LA cable subscribers. Several groups filed
    comments in the Los Angeles proceeding, urging an open broadband requirement, and also
    participated in a hearing in Los Angeles on the issue. The study and recommendations,
    which are expected to be released shortly, should be adopted by the City Council as the
    model for open Internet access that all cable companies will be required to adhere to in
    the city. </small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>San Francisco</small></font></h3>
    <p><small>Despite the fact that the franchise agreement for TCI stipulated that the
    franchise couldn't be transferred without the approval of the Board of Supervisors, TCI
    and AT&amp;T merged without getting approval from the SF Board of Supervisors. Although
    the Mayor's office recommended simply approving the transfer, the Board is considering
    tying conditions to the approval of the merger, although the current franchise agreement
    doesn't expire until 2005. Open access, free cable access for the SF public library,
    decreased or frozen rates, and additional money for public access programming are all
    issues that Supervisor Amiano has said he would like addressed in the merger approval. The
    Public Utilities and Deregulation Committee of the Board of Supervisors met on May 4th to
    discuss a possible settlement.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Denver </small></font></h3>
    <p><small>Englewood, CO, the home of TCI, is only a stone's throw from Denver. Yet,
    despite that fact, activists in Denver were almost able to convince the Denver City
    Council to condition the merger of AT&amp;T and TCI on the adoption of an open access
    standard. However, some within the city felt that the issue was best decided at the
    federal level, rather than by the city. In the end, after TCI threatened not to provide
    any advanced services to the community, the Council decided on February 1, 1999, to
    approve the merger, but also decided to subject the cable franchise to a referendum later
    this year.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Dallas </small></font></h3>
    <p><small>Dallas was also a hotbed of activity on the open cable issue during the
    AT&amp;T/TCI merger. A number of local service providers, businesses, consumer groups, and
    others banded together to lobby the local city council. Their website generated several
    thousand responses from citizens virtually overnight. When the issue came up before the
    city council, six of the fifteen members of the city council voted to require open access.
    Several council members who did not vote for open access indicated that they would bring
    up the issue again when the cable franchise in Dallas is renegotiated in September, 2000.</small><b></p>
    <h3></b><font face="Arial"><small>Pittsburgh </small></font></h3>
    <p><small>In Pittsburgh, the issue of open access was front and center throughout the
    debate over approving the transfer from AT&amp;T to TCI. However, after AT&amp;T filed a
    lawsuit against Portland, the Pittsburgh City Council decided that it would defer to the
    Federal Communications Commission to decide the issue. </small></p>
