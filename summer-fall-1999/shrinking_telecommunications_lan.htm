    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Since the passage of
    the Telecommunications Act of 1996, intended to spur innovation and increase consumer
    choice, a flurry of communications mergers has left large local phone companies poised to
    squelch any possible competition in the provision of residential telephone, Internet, and
    media services. Of the eight regional phone companies&nbsp; -- GTE and the seven Baby
    Bells created by the 1984 divestiture of AT&amp;T&nbsp; -- only six individual companies
    stand today as a result of rapid industry consolidation. Even fewer will exist if states
    and the Federal Communications Commission approve the pending GTE/Bell Atlantic and
    SBC/Ameritech mergers. </font></p>
    <font size="3"><p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps one of the greatest concerns for
    consumer advocates is that the recent merger mania has resulted in the formation of
    communications giants that will have the ability to decide who has access to essential
    information tools of the future, and how much it will cost. In the past,
    government-granted phone monopolies were under obligations to provide service to
    unprofitable areas. Today, the quid pro quo is for less regulation in exchange for
    increased competition. The latter has yet to materialize; thus there is fear that&nbsp; --
    in the absence of both competition and government regulation&nbsp; -- there will be little
    incentive for companies to deploy new high-speed services to rural areas, inner cities,
    and other high cost or low revenue places. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    community with the necessary skills to effectively use the World Wide Web for online
    communication, publication, and creative expression.</small></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><small>Launched in 1996, Open Studio established ten regional training
    sites to provide training in basic Internet and Web publishing skills, and more than 70
    access sites in communities across the nation to provide free Internet access and
    assistance in finding national and local arts and cultural resources online. Now in its
    third year, the Open Studio community has grown to include 18 training sites
    nationwide&nbsp; -- ten of these sites specifically offer training to artists and arts
    organizations in traditionally underrepresented communities. To date, over 600 artists and
    representatives of arts organizations have received training through Open Studio's

    Digital Divide </big></big></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"><p><font face="Times New Roman">It is already apparent that digital technologies, which bring an
    exciting array of new opportunities to many Americans, actually aggravate the poverty and
    isolation that plague some rural areas and inner cities. Study after study show that three
    major factors -- race, education, and income level -- increasingly determine who will have
    access to new digital technologies and who will not. According to a Computer Intelligence
    1998 Consumer Technology Survey, 80 percent of families making more than $100,000 a year
    have computers. By contrast, only 25 percent of families making less than $30,000 a year
    own a computer.</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A 1998 Vanderbilt University study based on Nielsen data
    from late 1996 and early 1997 indicates that racial inequities in computer ownership and
    Internet access are especially significantly for households with incomes less than
    $40,000. In such cases, African Americans were less than half as likely as whites to own a
    home computer and about 60 percent as likely to have Internet access. &quot;The rich are
    going to be getting richer in terms of information,&quot; says James Katz, a researcher at
    Bellcore and co-author of a survey on Internet usage. &quot;The information poor will
    become more impoverished because government bodies, community organizations, and
    corporations are displacing resources from their ordinary channels of communication onto
    the Internet. To the extent any demographic group becomes excluded from and
    underrepresented on the Internet, it will also be excluded from the economic fruits that
    such participation promises.&quot;[1]</font></p>

      </font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b><p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>III. Improving
      Access Through Community Institutions</big></big></font></b></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font COLOR="#000000" size="3"><p><font face="Times New Roman">Technology skills and
    access to information will be essential tools for life in the 21st century. The Department
    of Labor has estimated that 60 percent of all new jobs are expected to require computer
    skills by the year 2000. Millions of Americans are eager to participate in the new,
    technology-based economy, society, and polity. But they need access to computers,
    training, and support, to acquire the skills required by these roles.</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Community-based organizations are particularly well
    positioned to play a leadership role in spreading technology in low-income communities,
    mainly because they already have strong local ties. Community Technology Centers (CTCs)
    provide low-income, minority and other disenfranchised individuals free or low-cost public
    access to technology tools and services. CTCs have begun to proliferate in community
    centers, housing projects, libraries, after-school programs, and other community-based
    institutions around the nation. These centers provide a range of essential services
    including access to the Internet, literacy training, homework help, and even advanced
    computer skills such as desktop publishing, multimedia, and Web page design. In a survey
    of more than 800 low-income users of CTCs sponsored by the National Science Foundation,
    nearly 90 percent reported that a CTC had made a difference in their lives. Respondents
    spoke of improvements in their confidence, their outlook on life, and their future
    prospects.[2]</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But funding for these programs, which reach some of the
    most disenfranchised Americans, is inadequate and fragmented, and many centers are
    struggling to survive. While community-based technology centers have proven to be one of
    the most effective means of providing computer access and training to individuals who are
    hard to reach because of poverty, isolation, and cultural and language barriers, little
    federal or state aid has made its way to CTCs. The Congress has budgeted $10 million in FY
    1999 to support CTCs --the most substantial sum yet appropriated --the funding wound up as
    part of the omnibus bill under the budget for the Adult and Vocational Education Office of
    the U.S. Department of Education.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Clinton Administration has also proposed a $65 million
    budget for CTCs in FY 2000, which would likely appear in the Departments of Labor, Health
    and Human Services, and Education, appropriations bill. Tight caps on discretionary
    spending, however, may put CTC funding in jeopardy.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>IV. State Models </big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to proposed federal money, some states are
    approving regional phone mergers with conditions on combined companies that will improve
    consumer welfare and community access to technology. In both California and Ohio, the
    state utility commissions have opened up the review process to include a discussion of
    strategies for using the deals as an opportunity to secure funding for much needed
    community telecommunication services. </font></font><font COLOR="#200a81" size="4"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">California</font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As part of the 1997 merger between Pacific Telesis and
    SBC, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved a unique approach to
    expanding support for California's communities. Working with nine community coalitions,
    representing 134 different Latino, Asian American, African American, civil rights, and
    disability populations, Pacific Bell developed the Community Technology Fund, which will
    distribute $5 million in grants a year over the next decade. The fund is intended to bring
    technologies to traditionally underserved communities. [3]</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Grants will be awarded to diverse projects including
    consumer advocacy, multilingual assistance, and technical assistance. &quot;This fund can
    make a real difference and set a model for the nation,&quot; said Gwen Moore, former
    California Assembly member and chair of the Community Technology Foundation. &quot;I am
    excited that the program has the broad-based and collaborative involvement of community
    based organizations throughout California that are committed and dedicated to reaching the
    underserved.&quot; [4]</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81" size="4"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ohio</font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) negotiated
    approval of the merger of Ameritech and SBC to improve customer service and attempt to
    increase residential competition in Ohio. Additionally, the combined company has agreed to
    create two $2.25 million funds to benefit consumers. One fund will focus on informing and
    educating customers about their rights concerning communication services. The other fund,
    much like California's Community Partnership agreement, will help insure that rural and
    low-income areas in Ohio have access to communications technologies. Over the next three
    years, SBC/Ameritech will also provide an additional $1 million to existing Community
    Computer Centers that were created as part of a 1994 Alternative Regulation agreement
    between Ameritech and PUCO.[5]</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big>IV. Call to Action</big></big></font></b></font><font COLOR="#000000" size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As local technology centers anticipate the appearance of
    federal support, many states currently have the opportunity to ensure that communities
    benefit, and are not ignored, in the merger approval process. It is imperative that state
    utilities commissions take advantage of the chance to impact positively on people's access
    to the tools of citizenship for the 21st century. </font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The community investment provisions of the Baby Bell
    mergers provide local groups and actors an invitation to organize and impress on
    policymakers the necessity of <i>conditions </i>on mergers that build capacity and provide
    access in underserved neighborhoods. Specifically, community organizations ought to
    consider any or all of the following items as important conditions for regulators to place
    on prospective local phone mergers:</font></p>
