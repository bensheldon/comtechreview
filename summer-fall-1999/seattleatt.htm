    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cable provider TCI was recently acquired by ATT, which
    lays the groundwork to create the world's largest telecommunications monopoly. This
    acquisition means that many cities that had franchised cable service from TCI had to
    authorize the transfer of that franchise to ATT. This placed a number of cities around the
    country in the position of influencing this merger -- and put community based
    organizations in the position of influencing their city's decision-making process.
    Recently, the City of Seattle had two opportunities to negotiate with TCI cable over
    concessions in their current franchise agreement. The first opportunity: TCI failed to
    meet the date by which they had promised to build-out the entire Seattle service area with
    advanced infrastructure, per their franchise agreement signed three years ago. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    <td valign="top" width="586" colspan="2"><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The
    second opportunity: TCI and AT&amp;T asked the City to approve the proposed buy-out of TCI
    by AT&amp;T. Coincidentally, both events came to the attention of the City at the
    beginning of the year. Many local activists saw this as a joint opportunity to leverage
    even further concessions from TCI than were negotiated in the earlier franchise agreement.
    Unfortunately, this didn't happen.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">On the top of the
    list of concessions was the desire to open AT&amp;T's cable modem infrastructure in
    Seattle to all providers. The issue most important to activists was open and equal access
    to all Internet service providers (ISPs) ranging from small, local commercial ISPs to
    nonprofit organizations such as the Seattle Community Network. The City was already a test
    market for the @Home Internet offering via TCI's cable infrastructure. For high-bandwidth
    offerings such as DSL provided by the local phone companies, wire connection and ISP
    service are purchased separately. In contrast, TCI offered Internet service only through
    @Home, a company founded by a consortium of investors including TCI. When the franchise
    agreement was signed three years ago, the huge opportunities and popularity of
    high-bandwidth Internet access via cable was not anticipated. Therefore, at that time,
    accepting @Home as the only high-bandwidth service over the cable infrastructure didn't
    seem unreasonable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, the landscape had changed dramatically in three
    years. The importance of allowing fair, open, and equal access to the cable modem
    infrastructure was obvious to a wide range of concerned citizens and local ISPs.
    Constituents expressing concern included the City of Seattle's Citizen's
    Telecommunications and Technology Advisory Board (CTTAB). Members of CTTAB and other
    activists were aware of an earlier recommendation in Oregon issued by the Mt. Hood Cable
    Regulatory Commission (MHCRC) which stipulated open and equal access to the cable
    infrastructure as a requirement for transfer of control from TCI to ATT. The Portland City
    Council passed this recommendation. Spurred on by the bold move of MHCRC and the City of
    Portland, Seattle citizens approached the city with a similar proposal. However, AT&amp;T
    and TCI soon made it clear that the Portland decision was unacceptable and they
    subsequently sued the City of Portland Ð claiming they had no right to put such a
    requirement in the transfer agreement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, the Seattle City Council got cold feet.
    Portland appeared to be headed towards a legal disaster with AT&amp;T's suit, so the
    Seattle City Council decided to try and negotiate an agreement that would not precipitate
    a similar lawsuit. The Council had already heard from a number of concerned citizens and
    ISPs in public hearings, so it was difficult to dismiss the concerns altogether.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, as is the case with most negotiated agreements,
    the results were less than satisfying. TCI agreed to allow subscribers of their @Home
    service to get on the Internet without having to go through the @Home portal (i.e., you
    don't see the @Home screen). In addition, all ISPs can obtain access interconnection
    points to the @Home infrastructure, thus enabling them to provide the same high-bandwidth
    access that @Home can offer. This technically provides &quot;equal access&quot; to TCI's
    infrastructure. However, if a consumer wants to use an ISP of their own choice and not go
    through @Home, they will still pay the same price to TCI as if they were using @Home
    anyway. Thus, it will cost the consumer <i>more</i> to use an ISP of their choice, if that
    choice is any provider other than @Home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, a consumer would first pay $40 per month to
    get access to the @Home infrastructure -- the onramp. Then, in addition to that cost, the
    consumer then pays another $20 per month or so in addition for an independent ISP Ñ
    totaling $60 per month for high-bandwidth access over cable. However, if that consumer
    simply chose to use @Home as their ISP, all they would pay is $40 per month Ñ that's it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In other words, the city did not ask TCI to unbundle the
    price of Internet service and access to their cable infrastructure. Unbundling is a key
    strategy for regulators at all levels to ensure broad competition in telecommunications.
    However, the concept seems to have been missed when it comes to cable, even though
    AT&amp;T clearly intends to use its acquisition of TCI to broaden its dominance in the
    telecommunications marketplace.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the words of Seattle Councilmember Nick Licata, a
    vigilant supporter of open access: &quot;[Unbundling] is an important issue. It would be
    best if a subscriber would pay one price for AT&amp;T's cable hookup and then another for
    the @Home Internet service. I would like the City to require that price structure on
    AT&amp;T. But the city cannot require this unbundling because the Telecommunications Act
    of 1996 does not make cable service a utility.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In total, the City Council passed four pieces of
    legislation to handle the rebuild and transfer of control. They are:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman">TCI Rebuild Extension </font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman">Approving Transfer of Control from TCI to AT&amp;T </font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman">Cable Customer Bill of Rights </font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman">Resolution to explore alternative ways of providing the
          citizens of Seattle telecommunications services</font></li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">More information can be found at <a href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/cable/cableleg.htm">www.ci.seattle.wa.us/cable/cableleg.htm</a>
    .</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One interesting criteria included in the Transfer of
    Control legislation was a series of &quot;triggers&quot; to reopen the franchise. These
    triggers would empower the City Council to re-negotiate franchise terms if certain
    conditions were to change. One such trigger would be changes in federal legislation that
    would allow the City to impose pricing unbundling criteria on AT&amp;T. Another trigger
    event might occur at such a time that AT&amp;T captures more than 2/3 of the
    high-bandwidth market through cable-modem or other high-bandwidth offerings (e.g., DSL).
    These reopener provisions are unique to the City of Seattle and members of the Council
    consider these concessions to be a victory for public-interest. However, from another
    public interest perspective, very little benefit was obtained from these
    &quot;concessions.&quot; The $20 per month (or more) &quot;penalty&quot; to use an
    independent ISP is a huge barrier to open and equal access. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
