    on airwave ownership, consolidation in the radio industry has led to both a decrease in
    diversified programming and a decrease in opportunities for minorities, women, and
    low-income voices in the radio industry. &quot;Congress' recent decision to deregulate the
    radio industry has resulted in an explosive number of mergers and acquisitions that have
    placed the ownership of radio in fewer hands,&quot; says Kofi Ofori, author of &quot;Black
    Out? Media Ownership Concentration and the Future of Black Radio.&quot; This has caused
    what Ofori calls a &quot;crisis that threatens the survival of Black radio and small
    entrepreneurship in general.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It should not be a surprise, then, that there has been a
    surge in interest in independent community radio. <i>Broadcasting and Cable</i> (4/19/99)
    reports that in the past year, the FCC has received more than 13,000 inquiries from small
    groups wanting to start their own stations. As even FCC Chairman Bill Kennard has
    admitted, this is a sure sign people aren't getting what they want from existing
    broadcasters.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It seems, however, that the efforts of community radio
    activists have not gone completely unnoticed. This January, the FCC released its 1999
    agenda which proposed allowing community groups or small businesses that can't afford the
    facilities necessary for a full power station to operate smaller, less expensive stations
    with broadcast radiuses of anywhere from one to forty miles. In theory these small
    broadcasters would be limited to parts of the dial that aren't occupied by existing
    full-power stations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported on March
    22,1999, however, low-power radio faces a high power political challenge from broadcasters
    in the corporate sector who have invoked their lobbying group, the National Association of
    Broadcasters (NAB), to delay FCC action for as long as they can. The NAB claims that the
    new stations will interfere with the signals of existing stations, and take up space on
    the frequency spectrum that could be used to introduce new, digital services. Some
    broadcasters are also complaining that microradio stations will have an unfair competitive
    advantage, since they are entering the market with lower start-up costs.</font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
