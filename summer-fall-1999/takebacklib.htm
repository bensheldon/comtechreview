    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Public libraries are rich repositories of stories, ideas,
    information, opinions, and culture -- and are places where the human urge to communicate
    is celebrated with great gusto.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But did you ever stop to think about whose stories, whose
    ideas, whose information, whose opinions, and whose culture are celebrated at the public
    library? Almost always, the content of public libraries is from people who live in other
    cities, states, countries.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Often that content is interesting and lively. But the
    opportunity to meet and connect with the creators of that information is virtually
    nonexistent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consider what would happen if libraries set aside
    shelf-space for locally produced content. Locally produced books, sure, but also locally
    produced music, video documentaries, multimedia CD-ROMs, poetry, newsletters, photographic
    collections and the like. What would happen is that people within a neighborhood could
    connect with one another's creative imaginations. What a novel idea! In a public library!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Libraries today are reinventing themselves, holding onto
    the best practices of the past, while adopting new, invigorating practices. Community
    residents should relish the chance to shape the new form of libraries.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We need to remember that libraries exist to serve
    community needs. If a community feels that a library should expand its offering of locally
    produced content, then the library should be both receptive and enthusiastic about meeting
    that community need. The idea here is not to replace libraries' entire contents, but to
    supplement existing library content with the creative work of people in the neighborhood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Here's what happens when two people from the same
    neighborhood connect with each other's ideas and creative inspirations. A bond is formed.
    Two people know something about each other that they didn't know before. And we are no
    more, nor less, than the sum total of the bonds in our lives.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Have you ever been moved by a poem? Well, near where you
    live a tremendously talented poet lives. Ever laughed aloud at an author's witty remarks?
    The neighborhood wit lives down the street from you. Have you ever caught your breath
    seeing a photograph with indescribable grace? That photographer lives next door.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A vast transformation in communications is taking place as
    people rethink themselves as both information producers and consumers. We need to tap into
    libraries as the central place where locally produced ideas and information can be shared.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">How can overworked library staff decide which locally
    produced content materials should get shelf space? The answer is quite simple. The Friends
    of the Library groups can take on the role of recommending to the library the best of
    locally produced content. And as more and more locally produced content takes shape in
    digital form, the shelf-space requirement continually shrinks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">And if locally produced content is circulated, then a
    single library shelf could accommodate up to three shelves worth of materials, for at any
    given time two-thirds of the locally produced content would be checked out of the library.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you care about community building, and the connecting
    of human beings via the creative process, you need to get yourself over to a meeting of
    your local Friends of the Library group. Your voice, your talents, your vision are needed
    in molding the future of public libraries.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can build libraries to be whatever shape we want them
    to be. And you and I can decide the ways that libraries can best best be used for meeting
    community needs. The possibilities are tantalizing, if only more people would step up to
    the plate. </font></p>
