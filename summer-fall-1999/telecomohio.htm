    have secured funding through the regulatory process for technology access for low-income
    consumers in several cases. But perhaps the most important result over the last four years
    of active participation in this process has been the recognition by the Public Utilities
    Commission of Ohio (PUCO) staff and regulators that the digital divide exists and that
    funds provided by telecommunications companies to address inequities are in the public
    interest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Ohio, three cases have resulted in settlements with
    funding for community computing -- an Ameritech rate case in 1995, a Cincinnati Bell
    Telephone rate case in 1998, and most recently the Ameritech/SBC merger case, for which
    federal approval is still pending.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Edgemont Neighborhood Coalition is a grassroots
    organization located in the Edgemont neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio. Edgemont is a community
    with high poverty and unemployment rates. Linda Broadus, Edgemont's executive director,
    became aware of the potential for harm and the opportunities for benefit in the
    telecommunications arena around the same time the 1996 Telecommunications Act was being
    debated in Congress. Edgemont retained Ellis Jacobs of the Legal Aid Society of Dayton,
    and together, they began looking at proceedings before both the FCC and the PUCO where the
    issues of telecommunications access, economic development and educational opportunities
    could be addressed.</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    </font><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The first opportunity came in 1995 when
    Ameritech filed a rate change application with the PUCO. Because of the legal standards
    that telecommunications companies have to meet in order to satisfy regulatory bodies that
    their actions are in the public interest, Edgemont began to argue that to be in the public
    interest, companies must do something to address the digital divide. This argument was
    addressed in a settlement in September 1994. The settlement with Ameritech included, among
    other things, $2.2 million to open 14 computer centers around Ohio. The Ohio Community
    Computing Center Network (OCCCN), originally made up of municipal representatives from the
    seven cities and towns that joined in the PUCO negotiations, was started to manage the
    funds and oversee the selection and evaluation of the centers.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

    centers in the greater Cincinnati area.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">Then again,
    in mid-1998, Edgemont was presented with another opportunity to address the digital divide
    when Ameritech announced its plans to merge with SBC. According to Jacobs, this merger
    posed particular concerns to low-income communities. Edgemont's experience was that the
    larger companies got, the farther away the headquarters are, the more competitive global
    ventures they engage in, and the less inclined they are to look at and invest in
    low-income customers and communities, like the Edgemont neighborhood.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In July 1998, two months after Ameritech and SBC
    Communications announced plans to merge, the companies filed notice with the PUCO, the
    Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
    Edgemont, along with more than a dozen other parties, immediately filed to intervene. From
    July 1998 until January 1999, when hearings began, the process of discovery and case
    preparation took place.</font></font><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hearings began in January and went on for three weeks.
    During this time, parties brought witnesses forward to help prove their case. Witnesses
    for Edgemont included Roger Colton, a national expert on rate and customer service issues
    involving telephone utilities. After three weeks of hearings, those involved agreed to try
    to settle the case. Negotiations went on for several weeks, and some of the parties
    involved reached a settlement on February 23. The settlement provided a number of consumer
    benefits and charitable contributions including:</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important to note that not all parties signed the
    agreement. Signers included Ameritech, SBC, staff of the PUCO, Edgemont, Ohio Consumers'
    Council, and the Parkview Areawide Seniors organization in Cleveland. Other groups
    remained in opposition and refused to sign. Still others, including some
    telecommunications companies, signed as non-opposing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The stipulation agreement was submitted to PUCO regulators
    for approval in February. On April 8 regulators approved the agreement, leaving the
    approval of two more regulatory bodies before the merger is final -- the ICC and the FCC.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">FCC review has provided an opportunity for activists to
    again get involved. In April, FCC Chairman William Kennard sent a letter to the Ameritech
    and SBC chairmen stating the FCC's concerns that the merger does not satisfy the
    requirement that it be in the public interest. Kennard suggested having discussions on
    conditions that would insure this would be the case</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This letter opened the way for additional
    &quot;input&quot; on the merger. Many organizations, including Edgemont, the OCCCN, and
    other computer centers in Ohio, filed letters with the FCC asking the FCC to include
    conditions as a part of the merger. Other organizations filed letters with the FCC asking
    that the merger not be approved at all. It is promising that the FCC is considering
    conditions to insure that the public interest is being satisfied when reviewing a merger.
    An FCC decision is expected by late June.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>
