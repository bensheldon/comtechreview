    of 40 community-based technology resource centers and 80 technology vendors and developers
    working to increase access to empowering technologies by people with disabilities. ATA
    promotes access to conventional, assistive, and communication technologies through public
    service, public awareness, and public policy which mandates universal design and insures
    access to all technology products by the broadest spectrum of people. Our vision is of a
    future in which technology is flexible, inexpensive, accessible and seamless in connecting
    us to the world. </font><p><font face="Times New Roman">There are multiple policy issues
    of major concern to the Alliance for Technology Access and the communities it serves.
    Legislative mandates and regulatory decisions play an enormous role in the lives of people
    with disabilities. Among the key policy concerns of the ATA and its technology centers are
    the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Individuals with
    Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, all of which
    address the importance of access to technology by people with disabilities. At every turn
    in the policy-making process, equity for people with disabilities has to be safeguarded
    and protected because it can be so easily and carelessly lost. In many cases, like the
    implementation of section 255 of the Telecommunications Act, the issues are very complex
    and achieving the goal of accessible products and services for all people with
    disabilities is complicated and arduous -- but absolutely critical. What's at stake for
    people with disabilities is nothing short of participation in life - education,
    employment, communication, recreation and independence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Through the <a href="http://www.wkkf.org/ProgrammingInterests/FoodRur/MIRA/MIRA_init.htm">Managing
    Information with Rural America (MIRA)</a> initiative of the Kellogg Foundation, the ATA is
    supporting four of its technology Resource Centers to conduct innovative projects that
    will model how consumers and their families can impact local and regional policies and
    practices to improve the use of conventional, assistive and communication technologies in
    rural areas in schools, libraries, homes and businesses.</font></font><b><font COLOR="#200a81"></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Technology Tools for All Students</font></font></b><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Computer technology and distance learning are used
    extensively in Montana public schools, and high tech assistive technology is commonly
    accepted as an option for students with the most severe disabilities. However, most rural
    schools do not view students with milder disabilities as appropriate candidates for
    assistive technology. The unwritten policy is that students with mild disabilities need to
    learn in the conventional ways because &quot;they won't always have a computer with
    them.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The focus of this project will be to influence local
    policymakers and educators in the public schools to consider a policy change from denial
    of technology to encouragement of computer use to circumvent aspects of learning
    disabilities that cannot be remediated easily. The goal for the students is to prepare
    them to be more efficient learners whose output more closely matches their intellectual
    capabilities. The project will try to influence local decision-makers so that use of
    assistive technology for learning disabled students becomes culturally assimilated as
    something that is necessary and appropriate. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Project implementation involves on-site demonstrations of
    compensatory tools and trial use of laptops with appropriate software so that staff and
    students can experience and demonstrate how conventional, assistive and communication
    technologies can circumvent the barriers faced by students with learning disabilities, who
    represent 56% of the 17,000 special education students in the state. These students are
    covered by IDEA and local policymakers need to fully and appropriately implement its
    mandates addressing technology.</font></font><b><font COLOR="#200a81"></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Tele-School Project</font></font></b><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Carolina Computer Access Center (CCAC) is addressing a
    growing need for the development of policies and procedures to bring the classroom setting
    to home-based students with disabilities in the least restrictive manner -- using
    videoconferencing technologies. These current technologies have the potential to
    facilitate and enhance the inclusion of students with severe disabilities in their
    assigned school-based general education classrooms and provide a workable model for school
    policymakers in rural areas to replicate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Various technologies will be surveyed in the course of the
    project, some of which will be proprietary in nature, will require the installation of
    customized equipment in both the classroom and the home, and may require the installation
    of ISDN lines at the home of the student being served. These technologies will represent
    the high-end range of solutions, and will deliver the highest quality videoconference
    possible. Other solutions will be Internet-based and use a combination of proprietary and
    industry standard technologies to render video of an appropriate quality to support a
    learning environment. These technologies will be relatively less expensive to implement
    and represent the mid-range solutions. Still other solutions will utilize purely
    non-proprietary technology, including standard analog phone lines. One of the objectives
    of the project will be to determine which solutions represent a practical, replicable
    alternative for students and policymakers in rural areas.</font></font><b><font COLOR="#200a81"></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Affordable Access to Communication Technologies</font></font></b><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The project focuses on the need to develop low-cost
    Internet access for people who live in rural areas, are isolated, and live on fixed
    incomes. In many areas of East Tennessee, calls outside the county in which people live
    are long-distance, and many areas also lack local Internet access numbers. This project
    focuses on the policies, procedures, and laws that govern the pricing of Internet
    services. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Project staff will work in conjunction with the Knoxville
    Oak Ridge Regional Network (KORRnet) and their Computer for Homebound/Isolated People
    (CHIPS) program which provides computers to individuals in 15 rural counties. They will
    build a coalition of people that will work toward change in internet funding practices.
    The first step goal is to get low-cost Internet access to CHIPS participants so they can
    use the donated equipment to connect with the rest of the world. The next goal is to
    address low-cost services for all rural people in East Tennessee, and then to address
    affordable access across the state. </font></font><b><font COLOR="#200a81"></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Project ACCESS</font></font></b><font size="3"></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are good resources and policies in place in
    Kentucky, but people do not always know about them. Kentucky school policy states all
    children must have equal access to technology, the statewide network and other information
    needed to meet their schools' instructional goals. There is a trust fund (the Kentucky
    Education Technology System) that can be spent for assistive equipment but it is little
    used.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Project staff in Murray will train administrators, library
    media specialists and teachers in six school districts about accommodations which would
    make computers accessible to students with disabilities and how to access the educational
    trust funds. Accessible computer workstations will give students with disabilities access
    to electronic media and the statewide technology network. WKATC staff will provide
    training and information about low- to high-tech adaptations which will allow individuals
    with disabilities to use computers in the library and classroom. A Computer Access Kit
    which outlines resources (equipment and funding) to make computers accessible will be a
    product of the project, along with a blueprint for consumers and their families to change
    how policies can get put into practice to increase funding and access to assistive
    technology in rural areas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The anticipated result is that the total funding will be
    made available in the form of technology and support to those students for whom it was
    intended.</font></font><font COLOR="#200a81"><b></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Together these projects will increase access by impacting
    local, rural policymakers, while developing and refining policy change strategies that can
    be replicated in other rural settings. By documenting these projects ATA will develop some
    basic blueprints that can be followed by communities wanting to create more equity in the
    availability and use of vital conventional, assistive, and communication technologies. </font></font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
