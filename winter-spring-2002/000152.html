<div class="category_title">Northern New Mexico's Last Mile Technology: Wireless Service!</div> <span class="posted">by Judith Pepper</span>




<p>With the 
  growing use of the worldwide Internet, communication companies are providing 
  high bandwidth fiber optic backbones to connect communities to the rest of the 
  world. Left behind are the small rural towns and villages that communication 
  companies cannot economically servicing. Broadband fixed wireless technology 
  is providing a competitive alternative to solve this "last mile" or in many 
  cases the last fifty miles of connectivity to bring technological equality to 
  these small communities. <a href="http://www.laplaza.org/">La Plaza Telecommunity</a>, 
  a nonprofit 501c3 community technology center and network, is located in northern 
  New Mexico's remote, rural community, Taos, NM. La Plaza has a three-fold mission:</p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li>Providing 
    Internet access with dialup email accounts and 4 free public access sites;</li>
  <li>Education 
    and training, and;</li>
  <li>A virtual 
    community website.</li>
</ul>
<p>La Plaza 
  began services in 1994 with a T1 line and 24 modems, 1 free public access site, 
  and free classes in Introduction to Email. In 1996 La Plaza installed two 56Kbps 
  lines, a server and 5 modems in the villages of Questa (25 miles north of Taos) 
  and Penasco (26 miles southeast of Taos) for dialup access and public access 
  sites in each village, as the telecom had no plans to install fiber optic cable 
  to these areas.</p>
<h2>Questa 
  Wireless Broadband Initiative</h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><img name="n1128LaPlaza" src="/winter-spring-2002/img/1128LaPlaza.gif" width="270" height="196" border="0" align="right" hspace="5">In 
  1998, La Plaza collaborated with the New Mexico Dept of Communication and developed 
  a <a
href="http://www.nasca.org/awards/ppa.cfm">microwave radio wireless system with 
  T1 speed</a> for the Village of Questa. This system showcased to the New Mexico 
  State Legislature public/private partnerships in using State microwave towers 
  to develop broadband Internet services into rural areas that will never have 
  fiber optic capabilities.</p>
<p>The Penasco 
  School District, serving 800+ students, became aware of the Questa wireless 
  model and in 1999 requested La Plaza to develop a similar wireless system for 
  their computer labs and classrooms; thus, the Penasco Project was developed. 
  The Penasco Project had some unusual demands, far from the normal WAN installations. 
  The task was to provide Internet connectivity to the rural community of Penasco, 
  located in northern New Mexico and surrounded by mountains on all sides. La 
  Plaza was the closest ISP, some 26 miles to the North, with Picuris Peak, a 
  10,800-foot peak directly in line between the two towns.</p>
<p>Collaboration 
  for this project required many partners including La Plaza, Penasco School District, 
  U.S. Forest Service, La Serna Land Grant (who claims ownership of the property 
  on the Picuris Peak), Integrity Networking Systems, La Jicarita Enterprises, 
  and a private snow mobile company. La Plaza applied and received permission 
  to use the U.S. Forest Service Ranger Station tower and outbuilding atop Picuris 
  Peak.</p>
<h2>One Wireless 
  Technology Solution</h2>
<p>Wireless 
  equipment manufacturers have designed radios for specific use in Wide Area Networks, 
  WANs. These radios, designated Wireless Ethernet Bridges, are designed to be 
  fully compatible with computer networking standards. They have standard Ethernet 
  interfaces, 10baseTX or 100BaseTX, which are connected by a standard RJ-45 connector. 
  Many bandwidth options are available from several hundred Kbps to over 100 Mbps.</p>
<p><a
href="http://www.wmux.com/company/resource_center/app_tsunami.html">Tsunami radios</a>, 
  manufactured by Western Multiplex, were selected for the Penasco Project. These 
  Wireless Bridges operate in the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical 
  (ISM) band of 2.4 Ghz and do not require FCC licensing. The wavelength is not 
  affected by adverse weather of rain or snow. The radios have a wide temperature 
  operating range, necessary for locating at the mountain peak where extreme temperatures 
  are common. The radios operate over a wide range of DC voltage, lending themselves 
  to be powered by a solar / storage battery power supply. The radios also provide 
  the maximum RF output allowed by FCC regulation for that frequency. New wires 
  were placed on the tower to ensure proper leverage for placement of the antennas, 
  golf batteries were installed in the outbuilding and 18 solar panels were installed 
  surrounding the outbuilding to supplement the existing systems in place that 
  powered the government and private transmitters.</p>
<p>The following 
  is an account by the Integrity engineer of the actual install:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>"The original 
    schedule called for installation during the late summer of 1999. By the time 
    all the approvals from the government agencies and the landowners were obtained 
    it was February 28, 2000 when the install was attempted. Reaching the top 
    of Picuris Peak at that time of year was a major accomplishment in itself. 
    Three snowmobiles were rented and the services of a mountain guide were obtained. 
    The trail wound around the mountain and next to shear cliffs, sometimes through 
    snowdrifts deeper than one could stand. One snowmobile pulled a large sled 
    loaded with radio gear including two large 2-ft diameter antennas. Over the 
    more than six-mile trip up the mountain the sled and pulling snowmobile tipped 
    over and got stuck several times. It took approximately 2.5 hours to reach 
    the ranger station atop the peak. It was a bright sunny day. The air was 
    clear and crisp, and you could see for miles to the horizon. The sun was 
    warming and the temperature was about 35 degrees. As we worked we noticed 
    the air was thin and we tired more quickly. We quickly got the first link 
    up and running and measured very close to the calculated signal strength. 
    The second link was installed with equal success and we started to pack up 
    our equipment as the day was waning and the temperature was dropping. As 
    we started down the mountain the snow was wet and heavy. As we approached 
    the bottom of the mountain we encountered large segments of the trail that 
    had turned to mud. The unusually warm day, which gave us some comfort at 
    the top of the mountain, had melted the shallow snow layer at the base of 
    the mountain. The snowmobile pulling the sled had a great deal of difficulty 
    traveling through the mud. Several times the sled would get bogged down and 
    the drive belt of the snowmobile slipped and burned. About a mile before 
    we reached the meadow next to the parking area, all the snow was gone and 
    an ATV had to haul personnel and equipment through the mud."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With wireless 
  link in place, the Penasco school computer labs were able to connect to La Plaza 
  Telecommunity for Internet access. The link provided T1 bandwidth at a reasonable 
  initial cost and no recurring monthly fee. The 800+ students enjoy T1 speed, 
  as does the public access site sponsored by La Plaza. Through cooperation with 
  the school, other organizations in the Penasco area are able to have fast Internet 
  access. One such organization is the La Jicarita Enterprise Zone office based 
  in Penasco, which provides economic development and e-commerce opportunities 
  to over 9,500 native New Mexicans in three Northern New Mexico counties. The 
  entire Penasco Valley and neighboring communities now have broadband Internet 
  access that would otherwise not be available.</p>
<h2>Bridging 
  the Digital Divide With Wireless</h2>
<p>This leading 
  edge technology is worthy of recognition due to the many challenges of the remote, 
  rural and mountainous location populated by a tricultural peoples. The U.S. 
  Department of Commerce measures the Digital Divide by household connectivity 
  as a means of determining which Americans are connected to the nation's telecommunications 
  and information infrastructure. In 1998, they found penetration levels differ, 
  often substantially, according to income, race, geography, education level, 
  among other demographic characteristics. The Penasco Valley has the top 4 demographic 
  characteristics of low penetration rates with respect to computers and Internet 
  access. The Penasco Project and La Plaza provides for the entire Penasco community 
  broadband T1 Internet speed, free public access to both computers and the Internet, 
  and free training classes. The Penasco Schools now offer similar educational 
  opportunities to their students as schools in urban and metroplex areas.</p>
<p>The previous 
  solution of the 56Kbps phone line for Internet access to this Village is far 
  surpassed with the wireless system. Penasco Schools is the only school district 
  in New Mexico that is using the existing technology of broadband fixed wireless 
  Internet access. The telecom has no plans to lay fiber now or in the future 
  and without the new wireless system, the schools, enterprise zone offices, and 
  private citizens would continue to be left behind on the information highway. 
  The technology surpasses current solutions as it is less expensive, easier to 
  install, faster and more efficient, takes one day's time of installation, and 
  accessible as a solution.</p>
<p>The application 
  of wireless technology is making a huge contribution to this low-income, geographically 
  challenged community. The school district has in place a state-of-the-art Internet 
  access wireless system for educational purposes. La Plaza provides a Community 
  Outreach Trainer, 15 hours weekly, and has an agreement with Penasco Schools 
  to use the High School computer lab as a public access site. The students use 
  the site to complete homework and research paper assignments. During the school 
  year, there are 300 monthly visits in the site; during the summer, there are 
  350 monthly visits. A community college, 28 miles south of Penasco, offers 
  distance education courses for the Penasco teachers and these teachers often 
  visit the public access site to complete assignments. La Plaza received a grant 
  from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to train northern NM teachers how to integrate 
  the Internet into their class activities. Sixteen of the Penasco teachers were 
  trained and became trainers for the other classroom teachers.</p>
<p>Community 
  members use the site to access email and information on the WWW. Also, La Plaza 
  received a funding from a local foundation to develop a training model for at-risk 
  youth in web design. Six Penasco students are involved in this project. They 
  use the digital equipment, located at the La Jicarita Enterprise office and 
  purchased by La Plaza, to complete their assignments in web development. La 
  Plaza plans to integrate the web development classes in the high school, for 
  not only at-risk youth, but also other interested youth in the Penasco area.</p>
<p>The project 
  contribution is a wired community in a remote, rural, and mountainous area. 
  The future educational and professional contribution is unknown, but we do know 
  without the wireless application this village would remain forever in the Digital 
  Divide "have-nots" of computer and Internet access.</p>
<p>La Plaza 
  reports project results to the La Plaza Board of Directors, Penasco School Board, 
  and the funding sources of the special projects; i.e.; number of dialin users 
  for email accounts, number of students enrolled in Penasco schools, number of 
  visits in the Penasco public access site, and the positive outcomes of the special 
  projects available through this wireless system. To date, no one has considered 
  this project to be problematic.</p>
<p>This project 
  can be replicated in any community, whether remote, rural or mountainous. La 
  Plaza has installed wireless systems to the Town of Taos municipal offices, 
  the county hospital, private businesses, and has a pending project for the Taos 
  Pueblo. The model is based on the geographical challenges and the lack of telecom 
  infrastructure in the area. Any community that is willing to develop partnerships 
  and collaborate with need, engineering design, finances, and solution can replicate 
  this project. A PowerPoint <a
href="http://www.laplaza.org/about_lap/network/wirelessPresentation2/pages/11.htm">presentation 
  of the project</a> is available online.</p>
