<h3 class="title">Running LAPs: On the Local Access Path</h3>

<table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left">

</table>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left'>The challenges we face are 
  very real. So is our potential to solve them. We are at once on the brink 
  of annihilation&#151;and global fulfillment. Information and communications technologies 
  are making it possible for our voices to reach each other, an essential part 
  of the positive solution. And it is local access to information and communications 
  technologies that can be the pathway to a livable future. </p>
<p>But the local access pathway is not a clear, well-traveled one yet. "Community" 
  and "technology" are older than the words we use for them, as are "centers" 
  and "networks." We are using these words in the context of a profound transformation. 
  We search for and create new metaphors to talk about it, to guide us in our 
  next steps on the path, on our quest for a new paradigm.<br>
</p>
<h2><b>Paradigms and Changing Times</b></h2>
<p>Science historian Thomas Kuhn pointed out that the mechanistic theory of life 
  was what he called a <i>paradigm,</i> Greek for "pattern," a<i> </i>collectively 
  held model of reality, a belief system or worldview that influences the way 
  we perceive our universe, our institutions and ourselves. Kuhn showed that 
  periods of revolutionary change involve the replacement of old scientific paradigms 
  by new ones.</p>
<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td width=185 valign=top class="Normal"> 
      <p><font size="-2">Consider the familiar drawing of two profiles face to 
        face that "transforms" into a vessel of some type. The information on 
        the page is the same, but a different pattern or paradigm is re-cognized. 
        This is a great visual metaphor for the notion of social capital, the 
        human capital that resides in the relationship between individuals. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-2">Can you imagine the vessel, the contents and container, 
        with all the social capital of all the relationships? What could we call 
        that vessel of social capital? How do we access it?</font></p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For millennia Europeans clung to the paradigm that the sun traveled around 
  the Earth. Now we hold a larger paradigm within which we perceive "sunsets" 
  but conceive a solar system nested in a galaxy nested in a cluster of galaxies 
  and so on. Such shifts do not happen easily. </p>
<p>Can you imagine the whole picture, the pattern, existing at every level from 
  individual to organizational to global including the ecosystem of which we are 
  a part?</p>
<p>How do we collectively steer this abundant relation ship of relationships? 
</p>
<h2><b><br>
  LAP &#151; a big little word</b></h2>
<table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" align="right">

      sit down, you create a physical environment out of your physical self, your 
      lap. And you sit on something you trust for support. If a group of people 
      comes together in a circle of trust, the circle can support itself. It looks 
      funny because it's a lot of laughs. (The Lap session pictured here was 
      run in Reno last year with participants from the community technology, parks 
      and recreation, disability fields, and elsewhere.)</i></font></td>

</table>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>The notion of LAP involves both a metaphor and a "macronym," 
  meaning one acronym for many overlapping components of one whole. A community 
  LAP is the safe, nurturing storytelling, teaching/learning, responsibility sharing 
  circle of community made up of Local Access Places, Platforms, Programs, Partners, 
  Participants. The Local Access Purpose is the fulfillment of needs and aspirations 
  that enhances the chances for new generations. The Local Access Process is to 
  run LAPs. At the primary level that means to circle up and share visions according 
  to the Local Access Principles of Love And Peace, Learn At Play, Laughter And 
  Passion, Language And Process, Looking At Possibilities, Leveraging All Participation, 
  Linking Alternate Paradigms, Literacy Artistry Poetry, Legality Accountability 
  Proactivity, Lens Aperture Perspective, and, particularly relevant here, Land 
  And People.</p>
<p>The Local Access Promise is to nurture diverse, interwoven sustainable local 
  communities globally by facilitating and modeling the emergence of computer-empowered, 
  creativity-inspiring, consensus-building community communication centers and 
  networks. These LAPs are emerging in community centers, parks, schools, libraries, 
  housing projects, college and trade school campuses, training centers, and hospitals 
  as well as in public/retail areas such as malls, bookstores, and workplaces. 
  (This is being written from the Vital LAP. The Vital is Southern California's 
  oldest organic farm.)</p>
<p>Community technology practitioners operate in these different organizational 
  circles, connected and integrated with all kinds of media and technology, from 
  broadcast to the Internet. One of the most exciting and essential areas where 
  this is happening is the lapping of community technology and parks and recreation 
  public space. As all the circles grow they overlap and the perception of a 
  field emerges, aided immensely by efforts such as this journal. We need to keep 
  growing the circle thus helping all the circles to grow...and lap with all the 
  circles of community in the circle of life. LAP is an open invitation to an 
  open heart, open mind, open source, open space, open game. No one owns it; 
  everyone can use it; anyone can improve it. <a
href="http://www.lap.org/">LAP.org</a> shows more about LAPs and how they can 
  be run in any and all communities.</p>

<h3 class="title">Community Mapping for Neighborhood Knowledge in Los Angeles</h3>

<H2 class=MsoBodyText>Background: Data Integration and Dissemination<SPAN style="Arial: "></SPAN></H2>
<P class=MsoBodyText>The <A href="http://nkla.ucla.edu/">Neighborhood Knowledge Los Angeles </A>(NKLA) project began in 1996 as a web portal for people concerned with improving the conditions of Los Angeles neighborhoods. From the beginning of the project, NKLA has provided free access to a wide range of property and neighborhood data sets, information that can help community residents and activists in Los Angeles monitor neighborhood conditions by tracking early-warning indicators of decline. For example, users can map out indicators such as tax delinquencies, code complaints, or nuisance properties across the city in color-shaded maps to track where conditions are worst. They can also compare these trends with other demographic trends using census data. Moreover, they can access detailed historical property data such as code violations, building permits, and tax liens.</P>
<TABLE align=left border=0 cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0 width=200>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><IMG align=left height=240 src="/winter-spring-2002/img/nkla_1.jpg" width=320></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<DIV align=center><FONT size=-2>Presentation by Community Coalition</FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P class=MsoBodyText>The motto of NKLA, proudly displayed at the top of the welcome page, has always been, "Neighborhood improvement and recovery is not just for the experts!" NKLA was largely designed with community residents and community-based organizations in mind. To our surprise, however, the earliest frequent users of the web site were not community activists, but rather staff from local governmental agencies. We had given policy makers and staff from city council offices and departments such as Housing, Building and Safety, and Community Development a tool for easily accessing data that they should have been able to get through a phone call, but&#151;for one reason or another&#151;preferred to get by going to our web site. Through funding from the US Department of Commerce's <A href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/top/index.html">Technology Opportunities Program</A> (1998-2001), we were able to conduct extensive community outreach and training on how to take advantage of the data and tools on NKLA for community improvement.</P>
<H2 class=MsoBodyText>A New Innovation: Community Mapping on the Web</H2>
<P class=MsoBodyText>As part of our community-based outreach, we've done training in many community technology centers and community-based organizations throughout Los Angeles over the past three years, and this helped increase usage by community residents and activists. However, we still recognized that there was a need for a greater role for community residents in the project. It was suggested by community partners that we allow residents to be not only consumers of information, but also producers of information on NKLA. Besides governmental data, an important part of neighborhood knowledge is the everyday experience of community residents. In line with a "community building" strategy of community development, we began to look to residents to map out their knowledge of the neighborhoods in which they live. Following the "asset-based community development" approach, popularized by John Kretzmann and John McKnight from Northwestern University's <A href="http://www.nwu.edu/IPR/abcd.html">ABCD Institute</A> , we began to work with youth groups and students to map out community assets in the Boyle Heights and Vernon Central neighborhoods of Los Angeles. This asset mapping approach has become increasingly popular in community building projects, and NKLA's Inter Active Mapping Los Angeles (I AM LA) application went one step further by linking this process to the web. Participants enter property-level information into the NKLA data base though a simple web form, thus decentralizing the data collection process. These data points are then displayed on a dynamic map on NKLA, where users can view the community-created data on maps or lists with associated data. </P>
<H2 class=MsoBodyText>Community Mapping Projects in Los Angeles<SPAN style="Arial: "></SPAN></H2>
<P class=MsoBodyText>During the summer of 2001, NKLA worked intensively with three different community groups on creating their own web-based mapping systems. With the help of VISTA interns, the NKLA team worked with Youth United for Community Change (YUCA) in the Crenshaw district, the Neighborhoods Fighting Back (NFB) group in South LA, and the Pacoima Beautiful Youth Environmentalists (PBYES) in the Pacoima neighborhood. Each of the groups gave dynamic public presentations of their work at the <A href="http://nkla.sppsr.ucla.edu/photos/2001nklauserconference/index.html"><SPAN style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">2001 NKLA User Conference</SPAN></A>. The fact that each of these groups had their own approach and geographic focus necessitated a web application and training program that was both flexible and customizable.</P>
<P class=MsoBodyText>As a youth organizing program dedicated to cultivating grassroots leadership, YUCA was looking to use the I AM LA project as means to raise awareness about social and environmental justice in their neighborhood. Since the YUCA youth had taken part in previous training on asset mapping, we focused mostly on asset collection, input and ways to publicize their findings. In a short six week period, the group was able to collect and input 27 assets with full descriptions and images in categories ranging from churches and schools to "kick-it" spots. YUCA drove the process by selecting their own categories and publishing their project in a magazine.</P>

<TD height=50>
<DIV align=center><FONT size=2><I>Community-based organizations seeks to show environmental, youth, and recreational assets in their neighborhood. </I></FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P class=MsoBodyText>NFB's work remedying "nuisance" properties took the I AM LA application in new direction. Instead of mapping assets in their neighborhood, NFB leaders envisioned I AM LA as a way to monitor various liquor stores and motels that they had been organizing against since the civil unrest of 1992. In addition, NFB was composed almost entirely of seniors eager to utilize their little-used computer skills. Working closely with NKLA staff, NFB converted many of their paper records into a database on NKLA, and mapped nuisance sites throughout South Los Angeles. Included in their database was information on crime activities, dates of public hearings, and an automated tool for inputting additional comments on each nuisance. To date, NFB has presented their work to city agencies and plans to expand the database to capture all of their historical work.</P>
<P class=MsoBodyText>In Pacoima, the process of community mapping was at least as important as the maps and data that were produced. PBYES was interested in cataloging the cultural and artistic assets in their neighborhood as a method of promoting positive local images. However, as a relatively new group, community mapping was used a means of leadership development for the youth. PBYES's asset maps are part of larger vision of using mapping as a tool for community empowerment by designating potential development sites and organizing for increased resources for youth in Pacoima.</P>
<H2 class=MsoBodyText>Lessons for Building Community and Neighborhood Knowledge</H2>
<P class=MsoBodyText>The experience of using NKLA for community mapping has enhanced the community building process in several ways. First, it has served as a vehicle for training youth and seniors on how to utilize information technology and electronic media in their daily lives. For example, the youth in Pacoima used asset mapping to find previously unknown locations and individuals in their neighborhood. Second, I AM LA functions as an efficient data management tool that enables community groups to better document and archive community information. NFB adopted I AM LA as their own information system in order to better share and standardize their data collection. Third, web-enabled community mapping allows them to produce maps and data instantly, and share that information broadly. This means that groups can share their knowledge of their neighborhoods to a wide audience in a variety of formats. For example, YUCA plans to present their research findings to their city council member as a slideshow presentation to argue for increased youth resources. NFB has presented their online maps to local officials as documentary materials in public nuisance cases.Apart from its value to community groups, the community mapping process provides a vital service for other consumers of neighborhood information. I AM LA serves as a platform to organize and present the vastly untapped knowledge base of local residents and neighborhood groups. When this is integrated with other public datasets, it becomes a powerful snapshot that has the ability to aid substantially in building community and neighborhood knowledge.</P>

<h3 class="title">Contentbank.org: Content-Building for and by Local Communities</h3>

<P class=MsoTitle><A href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/"><IMG align=left height=59 src="/winter-spring-2002/img/aboutcpheader.gif" width=333>The Children&#8217;s Partnership</A> is launching a new web site geared toward community technology center staff that focuses on helping build content for and by local under-served communities in early 2002 &#8212; <A href="http://www.contentbank.org/">Contentbank.org</A>. </P>
<P>When The Children&#8217;s Partnership released its study <A href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/pub/low_income/index.html">&#8220;Online Content for Low-Income and Under-served Communities: The Digital Divide&#8217;s New Frontier&#8221;</A> in March 2000, it found that of 1000 relevant web sites surveyed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>6% or less of online content was the local information users want and need, 
<LI>1% of online content was developed for adults with limited literacy, 
<LI>1% of online content was created in a culturally relevant manner, and 
<LI>2% of sites made information available in a variety of languages. </LI></UL>
<P>The research also found that these types of information were precisely what low-income and other underserved users were often looking for to meet their daily needs.&nbsp; Moreover, community-users were more likely to be using the Internet to increase opportunities for themselves and their families: to find jobs, educational/training opportunities, housing and services. </P>
<P>The release of the research spurred a rich response from communities all around the country, and internationally, amplifying the findings of the report.&nbsp; In addition, many people sent ideas, requests and examples of community content.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Based on this outpouring and extensive research, The Children&#8217;s Partnership is creating &#8220;The Community Contentbank&#8221; to assist local communities find, use, build and share content within their underserved communities.&nbsp; In addition, The Children&#8217;s Partnership is working with advisors and community technology centers to make sure Contentbank directly meets the needs of community tech staff. </P>
<P>Contentbank provides three major elements:</P>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>Knowledge (e.g., ready-to-use curriculum, in-depth analysis of groundbreaking initiatives); 
<LI>Information (e.g., web resources in general categories, such as health, education and housing); 
<LI>Technology resources (e.g., web design, portals, e-learning) </LI></UL>
<P>Contentbank.org is envisioned as a &#8220;community space&#8221; that will provide an ongoing process for users to develop materials for themselves, alongside experts who help quantify and analyze what users need and want.&nbsp; The results will be shared on Contentbank.org with the broader community of those interested in local content and with policymakers, funders, the media and&nbsp; the Internet industry.</P>
<P><B>What to Expect from Contentbank</B></P>
<P>&nbsp; The following features are incorporated into the web site:&nbsp; </P>
<UL>
<LI>A translation utility to make the site accessible in Spanish; 
<LI>A Read-A-Loud utility that reads material out loud to provide assistance for those learning English (ESL users); 
<LI>A compilation of program profiles which created interactive manuals to develop community technology programs; 
<LI>A collection of reliable web resources approved by a team of content area experts; 
<LI>A community section for &#8216;community learning and sharing&#8217; with seasoned practitioners that will be archived and easy to search; 
<LI>An advocacy section to spur community and policy action on community technology issues.&nbsp; This will be closely linked to The Children&#8217;s Partnership&#8217;s online advocacy program: <A href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/youngamericans">Young Americans and the Digital Future</A> . </LI></UL>
<P>The web site is one element in a broader national program about content for underserved children and families that will help achieve the following objectives of the program:</P>
<UL>
<LI>To advance the development of quality content FOR AND BY low-income communities as a key strategy for overcoming social disparities and social divisions; 
<LI>To assist organizations, such as community technology access centers, get started with building their own local content for low-income families; 
<LI>To serve as a research tool to identify what low-income users need, what exists, and what should be done; 
<LI>To foster a link between the needs of low-income communities and the abilities of policymakers, the Internet industry, and other decision-makers, so they fashion their policies and products in a way that includes community interests. </LI></UL>

<h3 class="title">New Technology Policy and Advocacy Resource from The Children's Partnership</h3>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>With federal leadership related to communities and technology uncertain at best, opportunities to define this emerging arena are planted squarely with city and states. In response to this reality <A href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/">The Children's Partnership</A> has developed a new online resource for leaders involved at the city or state level in addressing the Digital Divide. </FONT></P>

<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Similarly, a wide variety of program and funding approaches are being used.

<h3 class="title">Editors' Introduction: Community Technology in a Post 9-11 World</h3>

<DIV class=Section1>
<P class=MsoNormal>The rapid expansion of community technology programs ended well before September 11. The slow-down began with the burst of the dot-com bubble. But 9-11 contributed to the slowdown in its own ways. In our new, security-driven economy, all social welfare, low-income assistance, and community revitalization efforts have been cutback in the face of new budget and policy priorities aimed at "homeland security," and there's less work being done on the bridge across the digital divide.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Yet technology in service of community building is still a powerful draw for those who care about these matters. "Alive and Well, Not in Manhattan Today as Planned," read the Online Registry, as <U><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><a href="article.php?article_id=62">Karen Zgoda</A></SPAN></U> reports and goes on to summarize the spate of useful online resources and approaches developed in the wake of 9-11 itself. Community technology has taken its hits, but continues apace.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Funding for two key federal programs that support community technology has declined this year, and are proposed for elimination next year. The Department of Education's <U><a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/ovae/ctc">Community Technology Centers program</A></U>, funded at $65 million in FY '01, will receive $32.5. The <U><a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top">Technology Opportunities Program</A></U>, housed under the Department of Commerce's National Technology Infrastructure Administration, receives $15 million ... down 65% from $45 million in FY '01. This may be the final year for these programs unless Congress is convinced otherwise. For a fuller and more nuanced discussion, see <U><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><a href="article.php?article_id=80">Ryan Turner's "Mixed Picture"</A></SPAN></U> policy assessment piece.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Yet in the face of these changes in the world and in the funding frameworks and public policy that support community technology, our work is growing and becoming more important. The people who have made it their business to conceive, fund-raise and manage community technology programs are meeting more frequently, in larger numbers, and in different countries. "Community informatics," an emerging, interdisciplinary academic discipline, reveals the intersection of our work with economics, computer science, sociology and community development, with degree programs beginning to appear around the world, as <SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><a href="article.php?article_id=56">Michael Gurstein</A></SPAN> shows us.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/conf2001/conf2001.html">Last summer's CTCNet's conference</A> drew 800 to San Diego and <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/conf2002/confhome02.htm">this June's gathering in Austin</A> may be even larger. Four years of rural-based community technology meetings held at the Aspen Institute in Colorado have developed into a nationwide Rural Telecommunications Congress that will meet next fall in Washington, DC. The memberships of key associations such as the Association for Community Networking have grown by 40% over the past year. The Global Citizens Network Consortium which met in December in Buenos Aires drew nearly 500 even in the face of that country's recent difficulties, as <U><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><a href="http://article.php?article_id=68">Doug Schuler</A></SPAN></U> reports. Plans are underway for next year's Montreal conference and the International Telecommunications Union's involvement in the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society marks that as an important gathering, too. These and other indicators show that the community technology movement is vital and world-wide.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>So it's a time of consolidation and shaking out rather than continued meteoric growth, and the <I>Community Technology Review</I> is moving quite well along those lines. We're pleased with the reception we have been given and to have found a key Community Building theme that helps direct our editorial efforts and call for material, one that's been so successful that we'll continue with this for the next issue. We're hopeful this issue's interactive components &#150; giving our readers and the community of practitioners the opportunity to send articles to colleagues, comment on them, and <a href="submit.php"><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none"><U>add to our ongoing resource development</U></SPAN></A> will contribute not just to the <I>Review</I> but to the growing vitality of the field.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal> &#150;  pm & rc</P></DIV>

<h3 class="title">Parks and Recreation LAPs Are "Connected" for the Future</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nrpa.org/"><img name="PamLAP0123" src="/winter-spring-2002/img/PamLAP0123.jpg" width="252" height="252" border="0" align="left" alt="National Parks and Recreation Association"></a>Parks 
  and Recreation Services are naturally positioned to become local technology 
  centers. Parks and Recreation department services have historically been mandated 
  to meet the social, physical, and educational needs of citizens. Through building 
  the physical structures and the opportunities to bring community together, Parks 
  and Rec has fostered community pride, and created relationships that help sustain 
  vital, healthy communities. It is here where we have established cultural, 
  social, and educational places where our community comes together. </p>
<p>Parks and Recreation departments are masters in creating successful partnerships 
  to achieve mutual gain. Be it a partnership between a non-profit and education 
  organization, a partnership between government and a corporation, leisure professionals 
  know how to develop key win-win relationships. For many years, they have struggled 
  to increase their services with fewer financial resources. Even faced with 
  the challenges of "doing more with less," Parks and Recreation departments serve 
  more children during after school hours than any other local agency. They are 
  known as the places where people "cluster." They are safe, welcoming, and nurturing 
  environments for people of all ages, cultures and abilities.</p>
<p>Parks and Recreation Department Centers are perfect sponsors for LAPs because 
  they're open long hours and provide community resources that include day-care 
  services, volunteers and volunteer infrastructure, and access to information 
  and technology that might not be available and affordable elsewhere.</p>
<p>As Andrew Cohill, President of the Association for Community Networking, put 
  it: "Just as recreation centers and parks create gathering places for community 
  residents of all ages, community-wide networks create online gathering places, 
  and the intersection of these two mediums (physical and virtual) creates great 
  opportunities &#8212; for technology centers, for learning centers, for technology fairs, 
  community networked offices, and other creative uses."</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3>The <a
href="http://www.nrpa.org/"><b>National Recreation and Park Association</b></a> 
  is taking a lead in encouraging the development of public access to technology 
  at Parks and Recreation sites. The NRPA represents over 24,000 citizens and 
  professionals in 5,000 or more communities around the country. There is great 
  opportunity for public Parks and Recreation to add value to existing services 
  through technology based programs and for the public to enjoy the added benefit 
  of connecting with their community in new ways. We are not surprised to see 
  Parks and Recreation programs and staff emerging as leaders in creating the 
  foundation for new and sustainable "local access places." </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3>The following are some examples of Parks and Recreation 
  based programs that represent successful models, as reported by those who staff 
  and work at them.</p>
<h3 class=MsoBodyText3>Public Recreation in Largo, Florida</h3>
<p>Technology is creating a shift in the recreation programming paradigm with 
  intergenerational applications of computer training through public recreation 
  in Largo. The many requests about where senior citizens could learn to use 
  computers led our staff to develop a partnership at the Community Center with 
  the city's Recreation, Parks and Arts Department, the Pinellas County Technical 
  Education Center (PTEC), and a private computer education company (that has 
  since gone out of business.) The Community Center offered space and furniture, 
  and scheduling, accounting and advertising services as well as youth members 
  to serve as computer mentors for seniors. PTEC offered the loan and up-keep 
  of 14 state-of-the-art computer systems and trained instructors. The computer 
  education company supplied workbooks and a large collection of interactive, 
  learn-on-your-own programs for various software applications.</p>
<p>The program objectives were designed to create increased mutual esteem for 
  the generations involved through educational interaction; e-mail was actually 
  the number one reason and stimulus motivating senior citizens to learn to use 
  the computer.</p>
<p>Begun in January, 2000, the program became an immediate success because of 
  a well done human interest story published in our regional newspaper, the <i>St. 
  Petersburg Times</i>. In fact, the Largo Community Center was forced by demand 
  to triple the number of course offerings which filled up for the next six months 
  by the end of that January! </p>
<p>Currently, the Largo Community Center is developing a partnership with a local 
  medical facility to create personal home computer applications for physical 
  fitness, dietary, and other wellness management and monitoring issues for use 
  with our patrons. As our elder population has become more confident in their 
  use of new technologies they are helping to define for recreation practitioners 
  those applications best suited to their needs and abilities. The Center is 
  in the process of remodeling space in order to facilitate higher speed Internet 
  connectivity and develop digital photography, voice and digitized music programs 
  and an area for paper craft creations such as birthday cards, flyers, origami, 
  and posters.</p>
<p>Through the use of technology, the relevance of our Community Center programming 
  is being redefined to better suit the needs of today's public recreation patrons.

<p class=MsoBodyText>The City of North Miami Beach, Florida, completed the renovation 
  for youth center in July 1999 with infrastructure for a future computer lab. 
  Monies became available through a grant six months later and, with the assistance 
  of the city's Information Technology Department, 12 computers with web cameras, 
  headphones, and a full array of software were purchased and installed.</p>
<p>The lab is open daily under supervision by a computer teacher. Children do 
  homework, email friends and family, play games, take pictures, make holiday 
  theme cards, and receive one on one instruction. They line up to use the lab 
  and it is rare to see an empty seat. In fact, the children have time limits 
  when others are waiting.</p>
<p>Classes for senior citizens held in the morning have proven to be a popular 
  program, with email to their families being the number one priority interest. 
  These are highly successful programs, especially for those in the area who do 
  not have computers in their home. &#8212; <a href="mailto:harriett.orr@citynmb.fl.us">Harriett

<h3><b>Library and Recreation Services in Aurora, Colorado</b></h3>
<p>When the Moorhead Recreation Center in North Aurora, Colorado, held an ice 
  cream social in 1999, participants completed a "60 second survey" identifying 
  what they would like to see in this low-income area of the city. One of the 
  top five items for both youth and adults was "library services." It was the 
  number one priority for youth.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>Based on this assessment, a branch library learning center 
  was created by renovating an old office and an adjacent closet through a Community 
  Development Block grant. Jointly developed with Recreation and Library staff, 
  the center was initially set up with three computers, providing access to the 
  library online system and the Internet, and a small collection of books and 
  tapes, some in Spanish. Patrons can check out books, request materials from 
  other libraries and pick them up at Moorehead, and they can type resumes, search 
  the web, and perform other computer activities. Last year the Colorado Library 
  Association gave the Moorhead Library Learning Center an award for "best outreach 
  to diverse populations." And thanks to a Gates Foundation grant, Moorhead was 
  the recipient of four state of the art replacement computers loaded with educational 
  software for children and adults.</p>
<p>In March of 2001, a small grant from Parks and Recreation for People was obtained 
  to support a volunteer teen library team to staff the center and encourage its 
  use, especially by youth. "LibTeens" (the name chosen by the group) take turns 
  staffing the library learning center every afternoon, check material in and 
  out and help users on the computers.</p>
<p>We have begun having preschool story and craft times at the Recreation Center 
  for parents and toddlers, scheduled immediately after parents drop off older 
  children at the school across the street. Recreation and Library staff work 
  together to set up snacks, crafts, and conduct the story time sessions. Fifteen 
  to twenty people attend them weekly. &#8212; <a href="mailto:knelson@ci.aurora.co.us">Katherine

<h3 class=MsoBodyText><b>Technology, Recreation and Learning Centers in the City 
  of New York/Parks &amp; Recreation</b></h3>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/parks"><img border=0 width=72 height=72
src="/winter-spring-2002/img/compresource.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026" alt="City of NY Parks and Recreation" align="left"></a></b>In 
  the <a
href="http://nycparks.completeinet.net/sub_things_to_do/computer_resource_centers/crc_main.html">Computer 
  Resource Centers (CRC) Program</a> , we incorporate technology directly into 
  recreational programming &#8212; mainly sports &#8212; building a strong recreation/education 
  partnership. Our students write stories about their favorite players and conduct 
  research on their favorite sports. Our curriculum introduces children to educational 
  technology resources in a fun and approachable way. </p>
<p>We recently began posting our most successful lesson plans on the <a
href="http://nycparks.completeinet.net/sub_things_to_do/computer_resource_centers/website_curricula/taoco.html">CRC 
  electronic curricula</a> section of <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/parks">www.nyc.gov/parks</a>. 
  Hotshot Animation is a storytelling and art project where children create a 
  "digital flip book" by stringing images together in a PowerPoint slide show, 
  an exemplary project because children learn a useful software application while 
  doing a creative activity that they enjoy. In the Partners Project, children 
  team up to represent their partners on posters, using a digital camera and design 
  tools. Displaying students' work and photographs in the classroom is a great 
  way to warm up the room and make newcomers feel welcome in the beginning of 
  any class cycle. (It is also helpful to teachers who have to memorize lots 
  of new names in the beginning of the school year.)</p>
<p>Both activities are popular because of their adaptability to various age groups. 
  Anyone can contribute to a simple slide show, and variations can be developed 
  as appropriate. I have used variations of the partners project with adults. 
  In our desktop publishing classes, adults present images that they have edited 
  next to descriptions of their individual editing processes. This reinforces 
  their skills and makes them feel proud of their new abilities. It is also an 
  easy way for adults to swap editing tricks and share new skills. &#8212; <a href="mailto:Ariel.Berhr@parks.nyc.gov">Ariel

<p>The Mesa Red Mountain Multigenerational Center, or "MG" as nicknamed by local 
  youth, is a multi-use 65,000+ square foot Parks and Recreation facility that 
  includes a gym, climbing wall, fitness center and walking track. Six classrooms 
  are programmed for special interest classes and a large dividable hall is used 
  for ongoing recreation programs as well as rentals and special events. Mesa 
  Senior Services, Inc., operates programs from 8am to 5pm weekdays. The center 
  also houses Sirrine Adult Day Health Care, a vital service for families with 
  frail elderly. </p>
<p>Along with these programs and amenities an additional, distinctive partnership 
  was developed to meet the ever-growing demand for community access to computer 
  technology. Beginning in April 1999, City Parks and Recreation staff and representatives 
  from Mesa Community College at Red Mountain (MCC) began discussing their educational 
  and recreational technology objectives and programming needs and found they 
  were very much in line with each other. MCC wanted to develop courses that would 
  appeal to the community. The classes offered would be developed based on feedback 
  from participants and public surveys. Since the partnership developed towards 
  the end of construction of the center, an existing classroom was retrofitted 
  and has 16 student workstations and an instructor station with projector and 
  screen. </p>
<p>The partnership has been operating for nearly three years with all classes 
  and activities, initially targeted for adults and seniors, filled to capacity. 
  Courses cover introduction to the Internet, basics of common desktop programs, 
  and workshops designed for first time computer users. There are 15 to 20 hours 
  per week of free lab time that are open to the public.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2001 drop-in programs were implemented for kids. An unexpected 
  intergenerational program developed from youth participant interest in digital 
  photography and desktop publishing. Senior participants have been interviewed 
  by youth and highlighted in the multigenerational center newsletter that will 
  be further developed in 2002 along with planning for specialty camps and enhanced 
  intergenerational drop-in programs. Most of the credit for the success of the 
  Red Mountain Multigenerational Center computer lab goes to staff and administrators 
  of Mesa Community College who have made a firm and positive commitment to developing 
  community education and technology access opportunities. &#8212; <a href="mailto:paul_widman@ci.mesa.az.us">Paul

<h3>The University Park CTC in Portland, Oregon</h3>
<p>The University Park Computer Technology Center, located in the largest public

  and the Intel Foundation. Our computer classes are available to everyone, regardless 
  of age or skill level. Our curriculum and programs include everything from 
  typing, Internet basics, and using educational games such as math in the real 
  world to video/audio creation, photo design, Lego robotics, computer building, 
  and web design.</p>
<p>We have a crew of youth who have been working on creating videos and music 
  to add to them. We are venturing out with web cams and live broadcasting of 
  events in the local neighborhood. We offer a variety of programs for elementary 
  and middle school students, and a laptop program for youth who are heading off 
  to college that requires them to keep up their grade point average and work 
  with the community center on a regular basis.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>At University Park we are thinking of new services to offer 
  the community, including starting a business where youth can design and offer 
  web hosting to local businesses. We are also looking for more volunteers and

<h3 class="title">Community Informatics: Current Status and Future Prospects - Some Thoughts</h3>

<H3>What is Community Informatics?</H3>
<P><IMG align=left height=200 src="/winter-spring-2002/img/fto_gurstein.jpg" width=134>Community Informatics (CI) is the application of information and communications technologies (ICTs) to enable community processes and the achievement of community objectives including overcoming digital divides both within and among communities. But CI also goes beyond discussions of the Digital Divide to examine how and under what conditions ICT access can be made usable and useful to the range of excluded populations and communities and particularly to support local economic development, social justice, and political empowerment using the Internet.</P>
<P>CI is emerging as the framework for systematically approaching Information Systems from a community perspective and parallels Management Information Systems (MIS) in the development of strategies and techniques for managing community use and application of information systems. As well, it is closely linked with the variety of Community Networking research and applications.</P>
<P>CI is based on the assumption that geographically-based communities (also known as physical or geo-local communities) have characteristics, requirements, and opportunities that require different strategies for ICT intervention and development from the widely accepted implied models of individual or in-home computer/Internet access and use. Because of cost factors, of course, much of the world is unlikely to have in-home Internet access in the near future. Also, CI addresses the questions of those with a concern for ICT use in Developing Countries as well as among the poor, the marginalized, the elderly, or those living in remote locations in Developed Countries.</P>
<P>CI represents an area of interest both to ICT practitioners and academic researchers and to all those with an interest in community-based information technologies. CI addresses the connections between the academic theory and research, and the policy and pragmatic issues arising from the tens of thousands of Community Networks, Community Technology Centres, Telecentres, Community Communications Centres, and Telecottages currently in place globally. </P>
<H3>Research Issues in CI</H3>
<P>What characterizes a CI approach to public computing is a commitment to universality of technology-enabled opportunity including to the disadvantaged; a recognition that the lived physical community is at the very center of individual and family well-being-economic, political, and cultural-and a belief that this can be enhanced through the judicious use of ICTs; a sophisticated user-focussed understanding of Information technology; and applied social leadership, entrepreneurship and creativity.</P>
<P>The research issues of interest to CI include how communities can become the subject of technology applications and how technology in turn can enable communities to become more active, effective and secure as subjects; the differing strategies required for urban and rural, low and moderate income, digitally literate and non-literate communities to become technologically enabled; strategies for re-engineering community processes of environmental and land management, cultural production, and democratic participation/empowerment; appropriate and sustainable business models for community based e-commerce initiatives; and the most effective methods of scaling/linking these processes laterally between networks of similarly enabled communities. A further issue of considerable practical importance is the on-going economic/institutional "sustainability" of local access--how it will survive once initial funding sources and volunteer participation are exhausted. The issue of "sustainability," of course, raises issues of the on-going benefits that ICTs provide to community members.</P>
<P>A theory and a practice of Community Informatics is gradually developing. Partly this is arising out of experiences with community access and community networks in the US and Canada and partly out of a need to develop systematic approaches to some of the challenges which ICTs are surfacing with astonishing speed, including the recognition that access in itself is insufficientrather it is what is and can be done with the access that makes ICTs meaningful. CI is also developing out of a recognition that there is a need to ensure a local, civic and public presence in an increasingly commercialized Internet environment.</P>
<P>The use of ICTs as a basis for local economic development and as a way of enabling and supporting local innovation is of considerable interest as well, particularly in the context of communities having to adjust to the often dramatic changes in local circumstances and opportunities resulting from technology change and globalization of production and competition. ICTs are also emerging as a tool for enabling the development and enhancing the effectiveness of local leadership and providing the means to create collaborative networks of economic, social, and political initiatives particularly for local responses to externally imposed change.</P>
<P>These questions are not of purely academic interest. Very considerable public (and private philanthropic as well as commercial) resources are being directed toward responding to the perceived Digital Divide as well as using ICTs as a platform for enabling economic and social development among marginalized populations and in Less Developed Countries. Determining how these resources might most effectively be deployed, as, for example, through "community" institutions, and the most appropriate strategies and models, requires both formalized research and the systematization of the range of practical experience.</P>
<H3>Community Informatics: Discipline and Practice</H3>
<P>CI functions both as an academic discipline for study and research and as a practice for those working, implementing, or managing community-based technology initiatives. In both areas it is still emerging, with a number of recent initiatives in universities and colleges and with attempts in various parts of the world to provide formalization and certification for community based technology practitioners.</P>
<P>As an academic discipline CI draws resources and participants from a wide range of backgrounds including Computer Science, Management, Information and Library Science, Planning, Sociology, Education, Social Policy and Rural, Regional, and Development Studies. As a practice, CI is of interest to those concerned with Community and Local Economic Development both in Developing and Developed Countries and has close connections with those working in such areas as Community Development, Community Economic Development, Community Based Health Informatics, Adult and Continuing Education, and Agricultural Extension.</P>
<P>There are a number of university-based courses in Community Informatics emerging across a range of disciplines but particularly in Schools of Information (Library) Sciences and of Management. Currently there are CI academic programs and research being undertaken in a number of universities world-wide including in Australia (Central Queensland University), the UK (University of Brighton and the University of the West of England), the University of Buenos Aires, the University of Milan, and Evergreen College in the USA and there are a number of recent Ph.D.sfrom the University of Brighton, Aarlborg University in Denmark, Georgia Tech and UCLA and several in the University of Michigan, School of Library and Information Science.</P>

<H3>Resources</H3>
<P>If anything, the overwhelming impact of the Internet has increased the challenges for both the theory and practise of Community Informatics where CI practitioners and researchers are leading the way forward as in the following Canadian examples, including</P>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>Designing ways of using ICTs to enhance the quality and coverage of electronically enabled public services such as the <U><A href="http://cnbb.unb.ca/">Conservation Council of New Brunswick;</A></U> 
<LI>Building, rebuilding and re-rebuilding the bridges across the Digital Divide as the multiple chasms of income, education, location, nationality widen between the sides such as through the <U><A href="http://cap.ic.gc.ca/">Canadian Community Access Program</A></U> (CAP), or <U><A href="http://olt-bta.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/CLN/">Community Learning Networks;</A></U>

<LI>Applying the principles of open source to the practise of civic governance such as <U><A href="http://www.geocities.com/c4ld/">Citizens for Local Democracy</A></U>. </LI></UL>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>Community Informatics continues to provide a place where academics and practitioners can meet and discuss issues of common interestassess strategies, develop models, explore controversies. As the area of community based technology applications grows, one can expect an increasing interest in and formal institutional attention to Community Informatics as a discipline.</P>
<P>The development of strategies to enable management use of ICTs to accomplish corporate ends is a well-recognized and widely supported component of business research, education and training. Community Informatics provides a parallel set of opportunities for those with an interest in enabling community objectives with ICTs.</P>
<P>ICTs are transforming the terms and conditions through which large scale enterprise activity is being conducted. To date, the opportunities for the generation of wealth, the achievement of operating efficiencies and scope, the extension of political and social influence and control have by-passed many as the technologies and their implementation have been geographically and socially focussed. It is proposed through the development of community focussed ICT concepts, strategies, applications and cases to provide opportunities for those outside of the narrow band of current participants/beneficiaries and particularly those most at risk from the aggravation of continuing social inequalities to have the opportunity to participate and gain benefit from this current transformation.</P>

<h3 class="title">The Institute for African American E-Culture</h3>

<P><A href="http://www.iAAEC.org/"><IMG align=left border=0 height=79 src="/winter-spring-2002/img/iaaec.jpg" width=322></A>The <A href="http://www.iAAEC.org/">Institute for African American E-Culture</A> was founded in 1999 by a group of academicians and researchers including Bryant York, Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University, and Roscoe Giles, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boston University.&nbsp; Their vision was to research, develop, and deploy advanced information technologies to support African-American communities. </P>
<P>iAAEC brings together African-American computer scientists, social scientists, educators and entrepreneurs to accelerate the development of viable digital cultures within the African-American community. One iAAEC goal is to bring its members out of professional isolation into a sustainable professional research community.</P>
<P class=MsoBodyText>Research is essential to creating, developing, and owning information technology.&nbsp; Many iAAEC members are researchers in various areas, and part of what iAAEC as an organization allows its members to do is come together, discuss research activities, and begin to link these activities to community and culture in a way that is not strongly supported by existing environments.</P>
<P class=MsoBodyText>One of the earliest results of the iAAEC members coming together was a project, proposed to and supported by the National Science Foundation, that encompasses many of the members&#8217; research activities and begins to link them together.&nbsp; This article introduces that research and its links to the community.</P>
<H2>IAAEC Research</H2>
<P>iAAEC has projects in four research areas: (1) Human Computer Interfaces and Collaborative Environments, (2) Core Technologies, (3) Social, Economic, Cultural and Workforce, and (4) Educational Technologies and Community Deployment.</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Human Computer Interfaces and Collaborative Environments (HCICE)</B> research group focuses on middleware for distributed collaboration technologies and culture-specific human computer interfaces.&nbsp; Research includes cultural preference and modes of expression, e.g., analysis of Hip-Hop culture vis-&#225;-vis societal participation, analysis of career choices by African American teenage males, and alternatives to the desktop metaphor.&nbsp; HCICE research has resulted in the development of two prototype technologies:&nbsp; (1) the African-American Distributed Learning Styles System (AADMLSS), developed by Dr. Juan Gilbert of Auburn University, and (2) the Hip-Hop tutorial developed by Dr. Robin Chandler of Northeastern University. </LI></UL>
<P>The AADMLSS is advanced instructional technology.&nbsp; AADMLSS is composed of synchronous and asynchronous components that provide culturally relevant instruction to learners using innovative technologies.&nbsp; The synchronous component is a real time interactive groupware environment where students interact with each other and teachers using various technologies including animated chat rooms and interactive video.&nbsp; The asynchronous component is a web based distance learning environment where students receive personalized instruction from a collection of culturally relevant pedagogies.&nbsp; Within the asynchronous component, each student&#8217;s learning experience is adapted to accommodate his or her individual learning style.&nbsp; This environment makes use of animated pedagogical agents as teachers.</P>
<P class=MsoBodyText>The <U><A href="http://www.robin-chandler.com/RMChtml/developmenthiphop.html">Hip-Hop Tutorial Project (HHTP)</A> </U>is a two-part cultural, educational, and multimedia technology initiative that includes a teacher&#8217;s guide /manual and an online course.&nbsp; The HHTP is both content- and technology-driven and aims at a practical means for closing the "digital divide.&#8221; It is a tool for those educators, artists, and youth interested in teaching and learning Hip-Hop. It uses cultural theory concepts, social science insights, and computer-mediated learning. The objective is to provide an immersive, interactive, multimedia instructional means for educating young people about Hip Hop Culture. It is designed to increase literacy skills by encouraging reading, studying, and informal research among K-12 age students. </P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Core Technologies (CT)</B> research&nbsp; studies the client and server technologies that are necessary for an efficient distributed implementation of systems like AADMLSS.&nbsp; From this viewpoint, the AADMLSS system consists of three major parts:&nbsp; (1) clients that are the people (e.g., students and instructors) interacting and learning concepts, (2) the delivery system, which supports curriculum sequencing, lesson selection, question administration and collaborative learning environments, and (3) the servers that include domain instruction servers and instruction content servers.&nbsp; The CT is focused on providing the services that facilitate the delivery system for distributed servers.&nbsp; Hence, the CT services provide the interface between the delivery system and servers. </LI></UL>
<P class=MsoBodyText>Currently, CT is focused on two services&#8212;security and performance.&nbsp; Security is needed to maintain the integrity of the content of the AADMLSS system.&nbsp; Further, AADMLSS maintains the results of each user&#8217;s interaction with the system such that a user, via a login, can continue sessions at different points in time.&nbsp; The performance service is needed to provide feedback such as how fast information is flowing to users and how much time access to content is taking.&nbsp; This information is useful for identifying ways to make AADMLSS more efficient.&nbsp; Other services, such as replication methods, are needed but will be leveraged from other projects in which iAAEC members are involved.&nbsp; <U><A href="http://prophesy.mcs.anl.gov/">Additional information on the performance work</A> </U>is available.</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Social, Economic, Cultural and Workforce (SECW)</B> group focuses on an empirical analysis of fundamental social, economic, and cultural factors affecting and often limiting African American participation in the IT enterprise.&nbsp; This group designs and administers questionnaires, conducts interviews, and collects supporting data.&nbsp; The SECW helps to formulate the central questions in conjunction with the other iAAEC research initiatives and assists with the interpretation of the results.&nbsp; This group plays a key role in determining whether the proposed technologies meet the desired goals of the iAAEC. </LI></UL>
<P>One major research area being addressed is the African-American adolescent male tendency to rely upon their immediate peer group to identify acceptable activities in which to invest the necessary commitment and effort. Often times the acceptable choices, identified by the peer group, are based upon a peer group&#8217;s definition of what is or is not associated with &#8220;being black.&#8221;&nbsp; Individual acceptance of and capitulation to group norms is often motivated by the fear of the loss of affiliation with the peer group and of being labeled as &#8220;acting white.&#8221;&nbsp; Consequently, many adolescent black males limit their academic pursuits to areas viewed as acceptable to their peer group. This pattern of group-imposed limitations upon acceptable activities for black males has been implicated in the tendency of black males to under-invest in their academic careers and to avoid the study of the natural sciences. This has critical implications for African-American males as more and more careers, particularly fields such as IT, require a sound understanding of the natural sciences.</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Educational Technologies and Community Deployment (ETCD)</B> studies the infrastructure&nbsp; needed to deploy IT in African American communities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Current initiatives in this area include:&nbsp; (1) Creating Community Connections (C3) system developed by Randal Pinkett (MIT Media Lab), (2) Decision Support for Student Success (DSSS) developed by Bryant York (Portland State University), and (3) learning technology through building community coordinated by Roscoe Giles and Raquell Holmes (Boston University). </LI></UL>
<P class=MsoBodyText2>The C3 system is a web-based community building system designed to establish and strengthen relationships between community residents, local businesses, and neighborhood institutions (e.g., libraries, schools, etc.) and organizations.&nbsp; C3 is a sociocultural constructionist tool, specifically designed to engage low- to moderate-income residents as the active creators and producers of their own information and content, as opposed to passive consumers or recipients.</P>
<P class=MsoBodyText2>The <B>DSSS</B> is a web-based decision support system to improve retention of minority and at-risk students at the university level.&nbsp; The system has been implemented in SQL Server 2000 and Java Server Pages.&nbsp; It maintains information that is useful to a student&#8217;s advisor in assisting the student in making sound decisions.</P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><U><A href="http://hpcl.bu.edu/">Learning Technology through Building Community</A> </U>is an undergraduate student-centered project in which students from diverse academic disciplines and backgrounds have come together to design, configure, and implement enhancements to the High Performance Computing Laboratory at Boston University.&nbsp; The participants have found new ways to engage each other in discussions and creation of technology that serves their needs.</P>

<h3 class="title">Small Points of Connection</h3>

<p class=MsoTitle><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/rallison.jpg" width="250" height="317" alt="Two women at a terminal" align="left">At 
  the heart of any community there exist many small connecting points: a conversation 
  at the bus stop, a nod in the grocery store, a shared smile over youthful antics. 
  Through fostering these seemingly insignificant beginnings communities are made. 
  The Community Technology Center where I work, the Rainier Vista Technology and 
  Job Resource Center, is centrally located in a public housing community. The 
  people using our center vary widely in educational background, areas of interest, 
  and level of support needed in their interactions with technology. Some of 
  them come in groups, most come singly. Some of those who walk through the door 
  for the first time are isolated in their own communities, having lived in the 
  same place for ten years, yet not knowing their neighbors. They never attend 
  community events. Their lives revolve around work and family. Their community 
  lives elsewhere.</p>
<p>When people come in for the first time, they find a welcoming and inclusive 
  atmosphere with artwork, photographs and signs up from different language groups 
  and cultures. When I first put up a world map, no one looked at it until I 
  printed out photographs from the various countries and put them on the map; 
  now that's one of the first places people look.</p>
<p>In the orientation and assessment phase we talk a bit to find out what a person's 
  interests are. I introduce new comers around the room telling people not just 
  their name, but what they are interested in learning. We do this each time 
  they come in for a while: "You remember Ayalew, he was here last week. Would 
  you walk him through opening up the typing program?" A couple of week ago, 
  an older Vietnamese gentleman was having trouble controlling his mouse. An 
  eleven-year-old from Ethiopia working on an adjacent computer piped up. "Oh, 
  I remember how I used to do that! Here let me show you. It's really easy once 
  you understand how." It is from such moments that a community begins to come 
  together.</p>
<p><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/RAllison2.Vietnamese.JPG" width="359" height="184" align="right" alt="Vietnamese Women">I 
  liketo think of it as a subtext for everything that we do, the foundation for 
  continued learning and dispelling the myths about technology, because for me, 
  technology is really about connecting people, connecting people to resources, 
  new ideas, and each other. I believe that through technology we are able to 
  explore the larger concepts of communities that live in a wider arena than may 
  be contained in physical space. </p>
<p>But I also believe that the process must be conscious, not necessarily engineered 
  but fostered. A few ground rules for interaction are helpful. The first rule 
  is that we are a neighborhood place and we greet our neighbors when they come 
  in the center. If I am not in the room when a newer participant comes in, I 
  ask if anyone greeted them. Then I may introduce them around again. A few 
  times like this and people get the idea. The way learners demonstrate competency 
  in a task or technique is to teach that technique to someone else. I try to 
  suggest as much cross-cultural interaction as possible. If a student has a 
  homework question, I may ask if someone in the room has any information about 
  the topic or suggestions about research avenues. Or if a learner has made a 
  break through, I will announce it to the room for others to offer congratulations. 
  Learners take ownership in such an environment. They include others. They 
  learn to work together and share their experiences. And what is community, after 
  all, than sharing our lives?</p>

<DIV align=center><FONT size=-1><I><FONT size=-2>George Stoney and Toni Stone on the Cablecast/webcast program on &#8220;The Politics of Public Access Cable and the <BR>Community Technology Movement&#8221; from last November. The program is currently available as <A href="http://www.bnntv.org/gbbn">video-on-demand</A>.</FONT></I></FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Since its founding in the early 1970s, the College of Public and Community Service (CPCS) at UMass Boston has been an educational institution with a commitment to serving disadvantaged populations by providing a relevant, hands-on educational experience, oriented toward student empowerment, community development, and social justice. To this end CPCS has tried to introduce new technologies as they become appropriate and useful tools to help accomplish its goals. Over the past decade there has been a movement in the introduction of new technologies from uses on the administrative side toward uses on the academic side &#8212; including instruction, community assistance, and program development. This process is now beginning to peak in the synergistic relationship among a number of related initiatives: a proposal for <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">a new degree program in Community Media and Technology</A>, the construction of a new computer education center made possible by a major gift from Monster.com, and the development of the <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista.gbbn.pdf">Greater Boston Broadband Network (GBBN)</A> with a consortium of university-community partners. Together these efforts combine the broad-based planning and programming potential and economies of scale of a regional digital broadband network with the multi-level, multi-site educational opportunities of a university-community partnership. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The GBBN project began in earnest after CPCS secured a $1 million grant from AmeriCorps*VISTA to place, train, and support up to 80 VISTA members in Community Technology Centers in the greater Boston area and across the country. The Boston-area partners in the <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">CTC VISTA Project</A> united to form the Greater Boston Broadband Network. The GBBN seeks to provide broadband connectivity, media rich content development, regional programming, resource and information sharing, innovative training, certified educational programs, and multi-site distance learning to the CTCs and community organizations in the five municipalities that constitute our regional target area.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>On November 15, 2001, the GBBN moved one step closer to reality with a multimedia presentation called &#8220;The Politics of Public Access Cable and the Community Technology Movement&#8221; &#8212; which included a live performance, a teleconference, a cablecast, a webcast, and an online chat. The event, sponsored by the CTC VISTA Project and the CPCS Community Media and Technology Program, featured George Stoney, community cable guru and NYU Professor of Film and Video, with comments by Antonia Stone, founder of CTCNet. The <A href="http://www.ltc.org/gbbn">presentation has been archived</A> and prepared for on demand web streaming by the UMass Lowell Distance Learning Center and the Lowell Telecommunications Corporation, both major partners in the project. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>To put all the components of the GBBN through their paces, the talk by George Stoney was staged as a presentation to a live audience in one of the interactive distance learning classrooms of the UMass Boston Information Technology Center. This facility allowed us to teleconference Antonia Stone into the live presentation via a point-to-point link with Indian River Community College in Florida. The live presentation was cablecast on Boston Neighborhood Network's channel 23 via the city&#8217;s Public Institution Network trunk.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The event was also sent to the Distance Education Center at UMass Lowell (UML) via the university&#8217;s MPEG fiber optic network.&nbsp; UML then sent the signal to Lowell's INet for cablecasting in the greater Lowell area and distributed the signal to a video server to provide an international audience with a live streaming video feed over the World Wide Web. In addition, the Lowell Telecommunications Corporation moderated a real time chat, which became part of the live event in Boston. The archived program now offers one glimpse of the capability of the network. And the GBBN is moving forward with a new season of similar presentations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The college has also ventured into international terrain via a teleconference with the Dominican Republic, which included the Vice President and Minister of Education, to develop online interactive educational programs in conjunction with the UMass Boston World Languages Program. Other initiatives include collaborative educational programs with the University of Havana in Cuba and plans to participate in a video streamed conference with the government of Puerto Rice celebrating the 50<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the island&#8217;s constitution.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>These operations have proceeded in tandem with the development of the new degree program in Community Media and Technology. As of fall 2001, the College began offering a Concentration and a freestanding Certificate in Community Media and Technology, and hopes to implement the full BA program in 2002. CPCS and its community partners are currently making plans to develop online versions of the instructional activities that comprise the Community Media and Technology Certificate. Buoyed by our recent successes with the GBBN, we have enlisted Professor Paul Nathanson of the University of New Mexico to develop an asynchronous, web-based course in &#8220;Media, Technology, and Community Organizing,&#8221; which combines on-demand streaming video presentations, real time chats, asynchronous discussions, and community-based projects. The course is being offered as part of the CMT Certificate and is open to CTC VISTAs to enhance their training and test the feasibility of developing a national constituency for our efforts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>These initiatives have received a major boost in the recent donation of $150,000 from <A href="http://www.monster.com/">Monster.com</A> and its parent corporation <A href="http://www.tmp.com/">TMP Worldwide</A> to construct an information technology facility at the college. The gift from CEO Jeff Taylor was presented to CPCS in November 2001 on the occasion of the retirement of his father, Professor Clark Taylor, one of the founders of the College. We feel confident that the new center will enable us to develop sophisticated computer-enhanced educational projects with greater degrees of facility and effectiveness.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>In combination, then, the above project components&#8212;the CTC VISTA Project, the development of the GBBN, the construction of a new information technology facility, and the introduction of a new degree in Community Media and Technology, along with continued support for this <EM>Community Technology Review</EM>&#8212;establish a unique and exciting university-community partnership, enhancing the educational opportunities available to a broad spectrum of students as well as providing critical points of technological access for community organizations and collaborative regional, national, and international projects.</FONT></P>

<h3 class="title">Alive and Well, Not in Manhattan Today as Planned</h3>

<P>Alive and Well, Not in Manhattan Today as Planned. So read one message left at the <A href="http://www.shunn.net/okay">"I'm Okay" Registry</A> from a woman in Brooklyn. This web site flourished in the wee hours after the September 11th attacks, briefly serving as an online survivor registry. Created by William Shunn to let friends and family know he was safe in the wake of the attacks, news of the site quickly spread. It had a million hits the first day, and William was unable to keep up with demand for information. He now refers visitors to official survivor registries but leaves the "I'm Okay" site up, complete with reports from survivors, requests for information, and expressions of support, as a collection of our memories.</P>
<P>One could scarcely imagine that the global roots of hatred and intolerance would manifest in such a horrific loss of life and force us to watch hijacked airplanes demolish icons of American stability. Like many on September 11th, I sat and watched events unfold in shock and disbelief. At work, the television and radio were on in the background while co-workers rushed to call loved ones and hear the blessed "I'm okay." A cousin sent me a frantic email as I was scheduled to travel for a conference on September 12th. My officemates and I jumped from one jammed news web site to another. Steve Coe posted <A href="http://ctcnet.org/americaconnects/acc1/0340.htm">a message to the CTC email list</A> <A name=_Hlt536719619></A>describing how <A href="http://www.cairn.org/">Community Access, Inc.</A>, a CTC located three blocks from the World Trade Centers, opened its doors to help survivors as they walked by.</P>
<P>The <A href="http://www.pewinternet.org/">Pew Internet & American Life Project</A> <A name=_Hlt536719722></A>released a report titled "<A href="http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=46">The Commons of the Tragedy</A> <A name=_Hlt536719922></A><A name=_Hlt536719917></A>: How the Internet was used by millions after the terror attacks to grieve, console, share news, and debate the country's response." According to this report, online traffic dropped in the immediate aftermath of the attacks as we relied on television and the telephone for communication and news sources. However, more than 53 million people, over half of all Internet users, sought news about the attacks online in the days that followed. Almost three-quarters of Internet users have used email to contact friends and family, discuss events and the fate of victims, display patriotism, and share news.</P>
<P>In addition, nearly a third of Internet users participated in online communities and forums to read or post materials in chat rooms or bulletin boards. Most reported that such virtual common spaces were both rational and civil. Derek Powazek describes how grief and hope connected us online at the <A name=_Hlt536720171></A><A href="http://designforcommunity.com/display.cgi/200109181922">Design for Community: the Art of Connecting Real People in Virtual Places web site</A> <A name=_Hlt536720097></A><A name=_Hlt536720186></A>. Three teenagers in Vermont, North Carolina, and California created the <A href="http://www.wherewereyou.org/">"Where were you?"</A> <A name=_Hlt536720256></A>web site to gather thoughts and emotions of everyday people on the events on and after September 11th. Fray.com chronicled <A href="http://fray.com/hope/pieces">personal stories</A> <A name=_Hlt536720321></A><A name=_Hlt536720339></A>from folks in NYC and Washington, D.C. <A href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! groups</A> currently list over 120 different online community groups in their September 11th category. As part of my volunteer work for AOL's Social Work forum, I participated in nightly chats to help folks cope. I can't describe how difficult and wonderful it was to have some small, yet tangible, role.</P>
<P>In addition to enhancing our communication, the web has also become a tremendous source of follow-up resources. The <A href="http://www.familiesofseptember11.org/">Families of September 11th organization</A> <A name=_Hlt536720760></A>was created to promote the interests of families of victims and support public policies that improve prevention of and response to terrorism.

Tracking down Federal government resources is less cumbersome on the <A href="http://www.firstgov.gov/featured/usgresponse.html">FirstGov: America Responds to Terrorism</A> <A name=_Hlt536721233></A>page.</P>
<P>In the spirit of wanting to help citizens be on alert for scams and false information, the Federal Trade Commission has published "<A href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/victimalrt.htm">Consumer Alert: Helping Victims of Terrorist Attacks, Your Guide to Giving Wisely</A> <A name=_Hlt536721446></A>."

<P>Ben Cain and I have collected youth activity, mental health, and communication resources in response to the September 11th tragedy for CTCNet members and others. Our CTC communities have historically addressed issues of cultural awareness and tolerance and will continue to address them beyond this event. We are all in a position to benefit from increased exploration and education on these issues.</P>
<P>Our deepest sympathies go out to all those affected by the September 11th tragedies. Be safe, and be well.</P>

Photo by Terry McLarney.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>At the beginning of the year, we asked Karen Chandler to give people an update on <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet</A> and how CTCs and the organization contributed to community building. This interview by Karen Zgoda is a result of that inquiry.</P>
<P><I>Karen Zgoda</I>: How has CTCNet changed recently and how do you see your current role?</P>
<P><I>Karen Chandler</I>: The past two years have been ones of transition for CTCNet. The organization has moved from being a project of Education Development Center (EDC) to its own incorporated nonprofit governed by its affiliate members. Since CTCNet began, our network has grown to over 600 affiliate members. During this time, CTCNet's organizational structure has adapted and solidified. As an independent organization, CTCNet has a Managing Director and an Executive Director. As ED, my role has been to help steer the organization through its own growth and change, which has taken place in an ever-changing economic and philanthropic climate. My role will continue to be to position CTCNet as a leading voice in the field of community technology, to work with the board and staff to ensure that we are serving the expressed needs of our membership through our programs and services, and to assure that we are responsive to the priorities expressed by our affiliate body.</P>
<P><I>KZ:</I> What are growing/evolving CTC needs? How is CTCNet evolving and growing in response to them?</P>
<P><I>KC:</I> CTC needs are at once constant yet evolving. Funding is a good example. Funding for technology programs is a constant need and, while recognized in the past three-four years by the federal and local governments and global corporations, remains an ongoing struggle for most centers. Funder awareness has changed, to be sure, and a wide audience now understands that CTC needs must be addressed in order to ensure a viable workforce, to offer youth the opportunity to create and to grow in their self-confidence, and to assure equal access to information and services. Subsequently, funding opportunities have been created. Community technology has slowly become recognized as a catalyst for social change, with CTCs as a key and recognized vehicle for bridging the technology gap. Witness, for example, the Federal Department of Education's creation of a <U><A href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OVAE/CTC">CTC Program</A> <A name=_Hlt536722935></A></U>. Yet while funding has increased substantially, it hasn't kept pace with the demand and the need. </P>
<P>Other primary challenges CTCs faceunderstaffing, maintaining technical equipment, and securing connectivityhave grown in proportion to the proliferation of technology centers. As the "digital divide" exploded into the public vernacular, so did the emergence of labs and centers within larger nonprofit agency associations. Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCAs, libraries, Urban League chapters, housing developments, and private corporations like Intel, to name a few, responded to the need for computer training and access that their constituencies were voicing by creating computer programs. The emerging gaps in the field of community technology, such as staff training and regional development, are being addressed through the work of CTCNet, the America Connects Consortium, and these national networks of CTCs.</P>
<P><I>KZ: </I>How do CTCs support community building and how does CTCNet contribute to these efforts?</P>
<P><I>KC: </I>CTCs have a vital role in any community, one that is a keystone in community building. Since CTCs come in all shapes and sizes, they provide immediate access points to different parts of a population (youth, adults, seniors). CTCs are well-poised to serve as technical assistance providers to other nonprofits. They are logical venues for citizens to become civicly engaged and to exercise their individual voices in the democratic process. CTCs are necessary components for any organization that provides job training, counseling, or placement. They can also fill a crucial role in advocating for themselves and technology education in local and state policy. CTCs have the potential to be the locus for activity such as calling representatives, letter-writing campaigns, and general civic education.</P>
<P>Any CTC is better served by knowing what its neighbor is doing in order to create and determine effective partnerships, to offer a range of needed programs or classes, and to share costs where it makes sense, and CTCNet helps connect programs, locally, regionally, and nationally.</P>
<P>As part of our America Connects work last year, CTCNet profiled <U><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/reports/regionalagenda.htm">three regional consortia-building efforts</A></U>--a key step in community building. While every local region has its own model of organizing, the common denominator is the impact of organizations working together collaboratively. This collaboration is not necessarily only amongst CTCs but also with other agencies in a given community.</P>
<P>Such activity bolsters the position of CTCNet in all arenas and allows us to more strongly represent the valuable CTC work that is going on around the country. It is the work of our collective membership that places CTCNet in a central community-building role in the national arena where we play a vital role in building a community of organizationsthat have complementary missions. The US Department of Education-funded America Connects Consortium offers a good example of this "macro-community," featuring numerous partners and friends who share the responsibility for providing services to Department of Education grantees and CTCs more generally. With EDC, CTCNet, the Alliance for Technology Access, HUD Neighborhood Networks (through ICF Consulting), and CompuMentor, to name a few, each of us provides specialty resources in serving the growing array of centers.</P>
<P><I>KZ:</I> What do you see as emerging trends and challenges in the field?</P>
<P><EM>KC: </EM>As is the case in most avenues of working toward social justice, the cause of creating digital opportunity and providing access and technology education to all people has many prongs. CTCNet serves an essentialand otherwise unfilledrole in linking the diverse network of CTCs to each other, in supporting regional efforts organizing CTCs and cross-sector entities, in providing face-to-face training opportunities, and in advocating for CTC interests on a national level.</P>
<P>In the past few years, more CTCs have incorporated classes and trainings into their services, either in addition to, or in place of, free-form public access hours. While many centers are placing greater emphasis on training and workforce development, there have also been expanding opportunities for CTC users to become content-creators. Some centers have shifted their focus (and sometimes their titles) to reflect "community production" rather than the more passive "community technology." For populations whose interests, languages, and cultures are underrepresented on the Internet, there is a growing effort to produce culturally relevant content.</P>
<P>There is another trend, slowly emerging, of CTCs serving as nonprofit technical assistance providers. The corresponding challenge here is that many CTCs do not have the staff capacity to take on such an endeavor. We know of examples where graduates from a CTC technical training program then provide their skills at below-market cost to surrounding nonprofits. The corresponding challenge here is finding job placements for people once they have upgraded their technical skills.</P>
<P>We've also seen an increase in programs like the City of Boston's <U><A href="http://www.tghboston.org/">Technology Goes Home</A> </U>program, where participants take a course in using a computer and upon graduation, take a PC home with them. This program represents an important element in our strategies to achieve digital equity; in order to truly integrate technology into people's lives, they must have access at home. One challenge here is in providing ongoing support once a PC is in the home as well as affordable connectivity.</P>
<P>CTCNet continues to try to meet the needs of its member centers in the realms of policy, funding, and partnerships. One of these needs, based on direction from our affiliate Board of Directors, is to stay abreast of policy developments in Washington, D.C., to communicate them to our members, and to involve ourselves in their development more proactively. We will also continue to provide and supplement the services that have been validated over the years: our email lists, our <U><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/membership/annual_conference.htm">national conference</A></U> and our <U><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/ldi/leadinst.htm">Leadership Development Institutes</A></U> (with support from AT&T and ACC), our <U><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/toc.htm"><EM>Start-Up Manual </EM></A><A name=_Hlt536724825></A></U>(with support from the Surdna Foundation), our <U>CTC Support Project</U> (with support from the State Street Corporation), our role in the <U><A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">CTC VISTA Project</A></U> (with support from the Corporation for National Service), and more yet to be determined as we continue to build this vibrant and growing ensemble of individuals and organizations, working toward expanding technology access and education for all.</P>

<h3 class="title">AFCN Organizational Update</h3>

<table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/Cohill.building.JPG" width="216" height="162" alt="AFCN World Headquarters" align="left"></td>

      <div align="center"><font size="-2">New office building housing the AFCN 
        Central Office in Blacksburg, VA.</font></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In the last six months, <a href="http://www.afcn.org/"><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><u>AFCN</u></span></a> has made 
  some major changes and has initiated some new programs.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes for the organization has been hosting and 
  services. Since its start, the AFCN has relied on support from members like 
  Charlotte's Web and RTPNet for the AFCN Web site and email. In the early fall, 
  AFCN made the move to its own Web site, which has allowed us to provide increased 
  member benefits. All AFCN members are now eligible for an email account (of 
  the form jsmith@afcn.org). All members also have access to a phpGroupWare account. 
  phpGroupWare is an Open Source software project that provides a broad set of 
  services via a web interface, including web email, shared calendar, shared to-do 
  list, chat, forums, project manager, and many other features.</p>
<p>Open source projects are likely to become increasingly important sources of 
  software for community networks. Two phenomena are driving this: first, years 
  of open source efforts are now resulting in very mature products that rival 
  commercial products in terms of feature richness and overall robustness. For 
  example, the &quot;trinity&quot; of Apache/PHP/mySQL provides a superb Web hosting 
  and development environment that provides the best set of development tools 
  that I've used in the past thirty years.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms of the Open Source effort has been the lack of a &quot;conversation,&quot; 
  in the sense of the <a
href="http://www.cluetrain.com/"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'><u>Clue Train Manifesto</u></span></a>, between open source developers and 
  open source software users. In the traditional marketplace, money provides the 
  basis for a &quot;conversation&quot; about matching customer needs with product 
  features. In the absence of a conversation, open source developers tend to write 
  software that interests them, not necessarily the users. Late in 2001, the AFCN 
  partnered with the Blacksburg Electronic Village to help create a conversation 
  between open source developers and community networks. The BEV and the AFCN 
  are creating an Open Source Software Award with a modest cash prize, in the 
  hope that some open source developers will begin writing software specifically 
  to meet the needs of community networks. If the initial effort is successful, 
  AFCN hopes this will become an annual award that will help sustain the &quot;conversation.&quot;</p>
<p>AFCN has also experienced rapid growth this year, with a 40% increase in membership. 
  Last year, virtually all existing members renewed, and new members from around 
  the United States and Canada also joined the association. Part of the increase 
  can be attributed to AFCN's participation and sponsorship of two major community 
  technology conferences. In June, AFCN partnered with CTCNet for a very successful 
  conference in San Diego that had over 700 participants, many of whom attended 
  the five AFCN sessions at the conference. In December, the AFCN sponsored several 
  sessions at the 4th Annual Community Network Conference in Austin. This conference, 
  organized by Gene Crick of the TeleCommunity Resource Center (and incoming AFCN 
  President) had more than 250 participants from more than 40 active community 
  network projects, and many of those projects signed up to become AFCN members.</p>
<p>Finally, the AFCN publishing effort mentioned in the last issue of the <i>Review</i> 
  is now underway, with numerous AFCN members writing articles for the upcoming 
  AFCN "Community Network Guide." The CN "Guide," to be distributed to all AFCN 
  members in late spring, will contain a rich mix of articles that cover a single 
  topic in depth, case studies of operating community networks, and shorter technical 
  articles.</p>
<p>Looking forward, AFCN will again sponsor several sessions at the summer <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/conf2002/confhome02.htm"><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><u>CTCNet conference in Austin</u></span></a>. 
  This year should be a particularly interesting meeting because Texas has more 
  active community network projects than any other state in the country; community 
  network projects should be well represented at the meeting.</p>

<h3 class="title">Delivering Tech Assistance with Circuit Riding: Learning through Two CompassPoint Projects</h3>

<P><IMG align=left alt="Save the Bay" height=225 src="/winter-spring-2002/img/Whitmer2.jpg" width=300>As nonprofit organizations become increasingly dependent on information technology to complete their day-to-day tasks, quality training and support become essential. Traditionally, nonprofits have met this need with external consultants, volunteers with technology skills, or self-taught staff. In recent years, "circuit rider" programs have become another way to provide onsite help with planning, implementation, training, and support of technology.</P>
<P>A circuit rider is a technolgy specialist who works with a group of organizations. These organizations may share similar organizational missions, may be part of an association, or may all be grantees of a foundation. Unlike a traditional consultant or trainer, the circuit rider has a "macro" view of all the agencies in the group and can thus develop training and support materials that are useful to the entire group. In addition, because s/he is traveling among agencies, the circuit rider can help "cross pollinate" agencies by bringing ideas learned at one agency to others on the circuit. </P>

To get a clearer sense of how this works, let's look at two circuit riding projects managed by <U><A href="http://www.compasspoint.org/">CompassPoint Nonprofit Services</A></U>, one with childcare centers, the other with environmental groups. The comparison will bring out the strengths of circuit riding, contrast the approaches used for each target audience, and summarize the lessons learned.</P>
<P>CompassPoint Nonprofit Services is a Management Services Organization (MSO) that offers consulting, training, research, and conferences. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, CompassPoint primarily serves that region but also undertakes special projects on a wider geographic basis. The organization has the largest nonprofit technology training program in the United States and offers consulting in a number of nonprofit management, finance, and technology areas. This article compares two projects carried out by members of CompassPoint's technology consulting group: the Childcare Center Technology Initiative (CCCTI) and the <a href="http://www.packard.org/index.cgi?page=ccli">Conserving California Landscapes Initiative</a> (CCLI). While circuit riding served both sets of organizations, there are substantial differences between them.</P>
<P>The Childcare Center Technology Initiative (CCCTI) served 125 childcare centers in low-income areas in five Western states from 1999-2001. The project was sponsored by Hewlett-Packard, the Packard Foundation, the Albertson Foundation, Intuit, and Microsoft with the goal of helping childcare centers begin to integrate technology. The grant provided a complete (and standardized) computer system with hardware, software, and peripherals along with circuit riding services for one year. In most cases, this was the first computer system in the organization. Alicia Daniels, a technology specialist who previously worked for a childcare consortium, was the lead rider on this project. Other technology specialists provided additional support for this large project, Miriam Engleberg, a CompassPoint technology faculty member, and me.</P>
<P>The Conserving California Landscapes Initiative (CCLI) project served ten land conservation and environmental organizations in three areas of California. As with CCCTI, Hewlett-Packard provided a standardized set of hardware and peripherals and the Packard Foundation funded circuit riding services. Unlike the childcare centers, all the environmental agencies had been using computers in-house for some time, in some cases intensively for land mapping and graphic design. The technology project was more specifically focused &#150; to improve image use in print, web, and public presentations. Organizations relied on their own IT support for their networking needs. I was the sole circuit rider on this small-scale project.</P>
<P><B>The Childcare Center Technology Initiative (CCCTI)</B></P>
<P><IMG align=left alt="Childcare Center Technology Initiative" height=64 src="/winter-spring-2002/img/Whitmer4.jpg" width=300>The Childcare Center project was designed with the mission, culture, and organizational structure of childcare organizations in mind. All organizations in this project were nonprofit, and had high turnover of staff and administrators. Workers, while often highly skilled in working with children, are usually inexperienced using computers. Children's care is their first priority, and computers don't directly figure into this work. Most centers do not have staff to work on tasks unrelated to children's direct care. They have small budgets, and did not previously have computers; there was little money available for accessories or computer support needs.</P>
<P>Considering these factors, the circuit rider began with the essentials and took a "whatever it takes" approach. Alicia created a checklist of the requirements to set up systems (power outlets, desks, and chairs), and even provided some of these materials, in some cases installing shelves in offices to fit the equipment into the small space available. </P>
<P>Trainings were customized to meet the mission and organizational structure of the centers, with written outlines of main points to be covered during training. We used concrete examples that directly applied to the centers &#150; actual calendars, employee schedules, and school lunch menus. Not all trainings were simple; at some centers Alicia created electronic parent sign-in systems. Alicia and I usually delivered trainings one-on-one and repeated them to teach multiple staff. This provided for childcare supervision continuity as well as individual attention to staff training needs. It allowed the circuit rider to deal individually with the anxiety felt by staff working on a computer for the first time. Like a standard training session, there was a basic outline, but the staff could ask questions at any time and the rider could pace the training according to the ability of individual staff members.</P>
<P>Working with Miriam Engleberg of CompassPoint's technology training staff, Alicia created step-by-step "stand-alone" training material to leave at sites. These materials used straightforward language, screenshots, and very direct instructions to cover topics such as moving files and creating folder systems, updating virus scanning software, and creating monthly calendars. These resources were also useful for staff that couldn't attend trainings and new staff members.</P>
<P>Alicia and the other circuit riders also helped share ideas across organizations. One example was the use of digital cameras. Agencies took pictures of children and put them on calendars, printed pictures on children's identification cards, and created their own newsletters. The circuit riders shared these ideas among organizations through a newsletter that we distributed throughout the circuit.</P>
<P>Finally, the circuit riders helped organizations with technical glitches and problems &#150; by taking care of some problems onsite and teaching staff to diagnose problems themselves (i.e., is the computer broken or is there a software glitch?) and dealing with simple ones directly. The riders worked with staff to develop a list of local resources to help with their problems when they no longer had circuit riding services at their disposal. This helped the centers become more self-sufficient over the longer term.</P>
<P><B>The Conserving California Landscapes Initiative (CCLI)</B></P>
<P><a href="Use http://www.packard.org/index.cgi?page=ccli"><IMG align=left border=0 height=56 src="/winter-spring-2002/img/Whitmer3.jpg" width=200></a> In the environmental and conservation organizations in the CCLI project, staff was more stable and computer-experienced, working in a context where technology was already being used intensively. These organizations work to convince the public of the importance of natural resources, which in many cases the public hasn't seen, so improving graphics clearly fit within their mission. </P>
<P>Many organizations set up their computer hardware prior to my arrival. Thus, rather than spending most of the initial time working on getting the equipment set up, though some technical customization was undertaken, I performed assessments of the staff skills and goals of organizations on my first visit and created in-depth custom trainings based on assessment results.</P>
<P>One finding was that most staff had basic office suite skills but no digital imaging experience. I designed customized group trainings in basic imaging skills, and smaller sessions on more advanced topics such as editing GIS maps and using Dreamweaver or Photoshop.</P>
<P>Six trainings overall were created in response to the site visits and assessments. Each organization chose two from the set and worked with me to customize individual organizational training and use time efficiently. Staff were asked to bring their own work tasks as sample material for these trainings so that organizations could learn skills while completing needed work. </P>
<P>I also shared best practices across organizations, including overcoming the limitations of equipment. The digital camera could not provide photos for use in hardcopy newsletters due to low resolution limitations, and the large-format printer was complicated to use. I helped share the experience of one agency that used the digital camera for online pictures and 35mm scanned camera pictures for their newsletter, and I learned the tips and tricks of the printer and shared these across the circuit.</P>
<H2>Overall Lessons</H2>
<P>These two sets of organizations and projects are extremely different, yet both demonstrate highly effective uses of circuit riders to deliver technical support. The custom materials and trainings that were developed for both projects would be too expensive to create for a single organization, but are effective when created for a larger group. The circuit rider creates standardized materials and customizes his/her training to meet the needs of each organization that s/he encounters onsite.</P>
<P>By helping more than one organization with similar needs, circuit riding creates an economy of scale that is more cost effective than working with a number of unrelated nonprofits. The circuit rider does not "begin from scratch" at each organization but instead shares the cost of learning among organizations <I>and</I> lessens the amount of time required to learn their specific characteristics and culture.</P>
<P>As the two projects show, the circuit rider can create customized material for multiple organizations on two different levels. First, to meet needs shared by common mission, culture, and organizational structure for the entire group; second, an even more customized approach for each individual client agency. In this mix of structured training and customization comes the benefit of the circuit rider model. Circuit riding is able to create an economy-of-scale, while remaining flexible to the specific needs of organizations. Funders as well as associations of nonprofits should consider circuit riding as an effective means to support nonprofit organizations' technology needs.</P>

<h3 class="title">Stopping in at TOP</h3>

<P>The <A href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top">Technology Opportunities Program (TOP)</A> at the U. S. Department of Commerce funds inventors. Not technical inventors, but social inventors, people who have ideas for using new technology in ways that create a substantial positive impact on their communities&#8212;improving health, safety, housing and job opportunities.</P>

<P>TOP grants have been given out for the past nine years to nonprofit organizations as well as state and tribal governments. Stephen Downs, the director of TOP, explains, "Here at TOP we're not excited about the technology itself, but in the ways people have devised to use it that positively impacts their communities. We're on the lookout for innovations that bubble up from local communities."</P>

<P>Admittedly, the TOP grants are one of the most competitive Federal grants. Thomas Hardy, Program Officer at TOP, explains this year they expect to receive about 650 to 700 grant proposals, but will fund only about 30. Hardy and other grant officers read hundreds of grant proposals and are involved in selecting grant reviewers. Hardy explains that community activists are the kinds of people TOP grants are intended to help, visionaries whose sole roadblock to a widely successful project is seed funding.</P>
<H2><BR>Losers Become Winners</H2>
<P>Despite the competitiveness of the TOP grants, there is much to be gained by submitting a grant proposal to TOP, even if your proposal is not funded. TOP staffers are there to help you during the grant writing process. They'll answer any of your questions. Email contact works well although they willingly take phone calls.</P>
<P>Grant proposals that are not funded have their executive summary published on the TOP web site, allowing the public (and possibly other funders) to examine the ideas in the proposal. Thomas Hardy and the other program officers take time giving feedback to unfunded grant applicants so that their grants can be resubmitted to TOP or to other funding sources.</P>

<P>TOP is also involved in <U><A href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/publicationmedia/publicationmedia.htm">publishing reports</A></U> as well as running an annual conference, "<U><A href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/conferenceworkshops/conferences.htm">Networks for People</A>.</U>"&nbsp; Dr. Bernadette McGuire-Rivera says the TOP web site is a rich source of information for potential grantees and passed along this helpful tip: "Read over the info about the grants that we have previously funded to see the kinds of things we'll be funding in the future. If your idea seems like a logical next step to the progression of ideas that TOP has funded, we want to hear about it."&nbsp; If nothing else, the TOP web site is a fascinating chronicle of heroes impacting their communities in new ways.</P>
<P>Stephen Downs added the useful caution, "CTCs are well-situated to submit TOP grant proposals since CTCs typically have an existing network of contacts in the community. However, TOP does not fund 'access' projects. We're looking for innovative ideas more than worthy causes. If you feel your CTC has an exciting new way of doing something, that's when we'd like to hear from you."</P>
<P>In past years TOP has funded some CTCNet affiliates including <U><A href="http://www.pluggedin.org/">Plugged In</A></U>, the <U><A href="http://www.acenetworks.org/">Appalachian Center for Economic Networks</A></U>, and <U><A href="http://www.tincan.org/">TINCAN</A></U>.&nbsp; Plugged In received an initial grant in 1995 and this year a second grant, this time for $850,000. Details of these and other grants are available through the <U><A href="http://ntiaotiant2.ntia.doc.gov/top/index.cfm">searchable TOP database</A> </U>.</P>
<P>Downs says that TOP is especially on the lookout for community-building solutions using broadband and wireless technologies. Almost all TOP grantees use the Internet in some way, although TOP usually does not fund web site development. TOP grants also have the benefit of being broadly focused. While other Federal grants are tailored to a very specific purpose, TOP grants are more open-ended&#8212;extending to community arts projects.</P>

<P>Judith Sparrow, another program officer at TOP, says she's very happy to give advice to folks who want to know whether they're on the right track with their grant proposal. Sparrow was involved in Plugged In's first TOP grant and has watched that program grow to gain national attention and sponsors. <U><A href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/whoweare/staff.htm">Phone numbers and email addresses</A> </U>for all staff are readily available at the web site.</P>
<H2>The Future of TOP</H2>
<P>TOP's continued success depends on innovative, hard-working community activists coming up with fresh new ideas. Stephen Downs urges people to "dream big," to conjure up ideas of what could be possible while at the same time staying realistic. Interestingly enough, we in the CTC movement can support TOP by submitting grant proposals&#8212;and executing well on those that are funded.</P>

<h3 class="title">Buenos Aires, Montreal, and Seattle: Civic Unrest and Civic Intelligence</h3>

<P>In December 2001, 550 people from South America and around the world gathered in Buenos Aires, Argentina for the <U><A href="http://www.globalcn2001.org/">2nd Global Congress on Community Networks</A></U> to discuss their projects and their dreams for equitable access to communication. Argentina's economic situation has been deteriorating for years: the government was now paying wages in scrip; withdrawals from saving accounts were severely limited; pensioners were receiving reduced benefits. Outside of the conference hotel, on the streets, the financial problems that had been festering for years were rapidly mutating into a crisis that was visible even to a casual visitor. There were long unhappy lines at all the banks and cash machines and noisy street demonstrations were becoming commonplace. And just days after we had all returned to our homes, riots and looting broke out all over Argentina, and a brutal response by the police resulted in nearly 30 deaths. In the ensuing turmoil Argentina had five presidents in a rocky twelve day period, the national ministry of finance was set ablaze, grocery stores ransacked, and the congress invaded. The people blame corrupt and uncaring politicians, privatization of state assets, and a globalized economy which has no compassion. As of mid-January, the situation is still unresolved and serious. Some of the more pessimistic predictions include fragmentation of the country, a return to fascism, or a civil war. </P>

<DIV align=center>Shrine at Plaza de Mayo, December, 2001, (www.madres.org)</DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>In the background, but not totally absent, is the gloomy shadow of Argentina's "Dirty War" in which a rightwing junta terrorized the country between 1976 and 1983, killing some 10,000 to 30,000 people (the "disappeared"). During a break in the conference discussions I visited the Plaza de Mayo, adjacent to the presidential offices, where the mothers of the "disappeared" (<U><A href="http://www.madres.org/">Asociaci&ograve;n Madres de Plaza de Mayo</A></U>) have been holding vigils for over 20 years. By lucky coincidence, an anniversary event was taking place in the plaza. In Argentina's late spring warmth (in contrast to Seattle's cold and rainy fall that I had just left) I unexpectedly came across the beautiful and powerful &#150; and immensely moving &#150; shrine to the disappeared which had been erected on the plaza. An immense rectangular structure some forty feet tall was covered on all four sides by photos of women and men, mostly young, who had been deemed dangerous enough by the military to be tortured and executed. The stark memorial and the ongoing efforts of the mothers and their allies help keep alive the memory of the brutal repression in Argentina while serving as a reminder that dissident voices are at risk to varying degrees outside of Argentina as well as within. The memorial also demonstrates the important lesson that information assumes many shapes, from coldly digital statistics to the arresting, palpable, public, and human tribute that the Madres had erected. </P>

<P>Against the background of globalized economic forces, government corruption, incompetence and arrogance, and a frustrated and volatile mass of people caught up in systems that they feel powerless to confront, community communication activists like ourselves need to ask &#150; and attempt to answer &#150; the difficult questions of our reformist objectives: Do our civic efforts add up? Do they help isolated individuals one at a time or can they have the power to ultimately transform society into one that is more humane? Are today's institutions so entrenched, humankind's predilections so hardwired that any alternative is doomed and any person who indulges in alternative thinking is naive? Or are we merely rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic?</P>
<P>My <U><A href="http://www.scn.org/commnet/Presentations/ba/ba2001.html">presentation on "civic intelligence"</A> <A name=_Hlt536096182></A></U>was intended to contextualize the work of the delegates and help foster a common agenda. Similarly, the goals of the congress were to give strength and coherence to the community networking / telecenter-CTC movement worldwide. The work will continue on in <U><A href="http://www.globalcnpartnership.org/">Montreal in the fall of 2002</A></U>. They hope, beyond that, to help influence the United Nations with its Information Society summit scheduled for 2003 in Geneva. The <U><A href="http://www.public-sphere.net/">Public Sphere Project</A></U> of <U><A href="http://www.cpsr.org/">Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)</A></U> is also working in this area as are thousands of other groups around the world. </P>
<P>The Public Sphere Project in conjunction with the National Communication Association's Task Force on the Digital Divide is striving to help move this discussion forward in two ways. The first is by convening an international symposium May 16-19, 2002 in Seattle on the topic of <U><A href="http://www.cpsr.org/conferences/diac02">"Shaping the Network Society"</A></U>. This symposium will bring together researchers and activists, educators and policy-makers, journalists and artists, and everybody in between, for face-to-face discussion and community building.</P>
<P>The second is an ambitious complementary effort to develop a "knowledge base" that reflects our collective, global wisdom of our community. We are attempting to build a foundation that gives our movement strength, that inspires us and instructs us, that binds and bridges communities, both local and global. To accomplish this we have been soliciting "patterns" via a <U><A href="http://diac.cpsr.org/cgi-bin/diac02/pattern.cgi">pattern management system</A> <A name=_Hlt536096565></A></U>on the web. Patterns are structured chunks of information that contain a problem statement, a proposed solution to the problem, a context where the pattern can be used, and a discussion. The idea of this sort of structured pattern is borrowed from Christopher Alexander, an architect, now retired, from the University of California, Berkeley, who used it in his immensely popular book, <I>A Pattern Language</I>, co-authored with colleagues, which contains 253 patterns for the design and construction of human life-affirming habitations. We are attempting to do the same thing in the communication realm. </P>
<P>Over 150 "patterns" have now been proposed by communication researchers and activists from twenty countries, and their scope thus far is breathtaking. One pattern addresses the role of memory and responsibility as symbolized by the Madres shrine. Other themes include: tools and strategies for community technology centers, community networks, organizations, towns, digital cities, and world summits; universal voice mail, media activism, and new technologies; open source community software, search engines, classification systems and cultural databases; resources for health, education, social change, and anti-poverty work; policy work around privacy, civil liberties, and combating the increasing inequality that new technologies may help usher in.</P>We welcome everybody who is interested in the continuing democratization of information and communication to come to the symposium in Seattle. The broader "pattern language" that we're developing will reflect our values and ideas while, hopefully, inspiring others to join this struggle as well. We invite you to view the patterns that are currently under consideration and to propose new ones. In any work for social justice, information and communication will play some part. We are now defining that crucial part. Civic intelligence can make civil unrest unnecessary &#150; at least that is our hope.

<h3 class="title">Community Networking on the Night Shift, Part Three: Librarians, Community Networks, and Philosophy Lite</h3>

<P>In Part 2 of this series, "<A href="article.php?article_id=92">When A Community Organizer Tries to be a Techie," </A>I detailed my losing battle with technology and publicly admitted to being a technomoron. Hating to leave myself with that label, I have been looking for something that I'm reasonably good at that I could share with community networkers. A few things I've learned from my day job as a law librarian might actually be helpful. So I'm going to divest myself of some philosophy lite, which is what you get when you philosophize on the night shift.</P>
<P>I find myself rereading Tom Grundner's Letters to the Fourth World, which are far better philosophy than I'm capable of, yet I find myself debating some of his thoughts about the relationship of libraries and librarians to community networking.</P>
<P>Two of those letters are online at <A href="http://www.acorn.net/">www.acorn.net</A>, in the Original Acorn Menus section under "Community Nets Theme Parks"; the <A href="http://www.lafn.org/webconnect/inspire.htm">Final Letter</A> is also online at the Los Angeles FreeNet. </P>
<P>The first letter was what got me started in community networking. Much of the philosophy of community networking is in that letter, and there's nothing that I can add to it. The Final Letter was one that Tom agreed to write to those of us at ACORN, the Akron Community Online Resource Network, before he retired from community networking.</P>
<P>In that letter he talked about the radius, the idea that within a ten-mile radius of the center of most reasonably well populated areas there is enough knowledge to answer the questions of everyone within that radius. And he saw that knowledge ranging from what we commonly call "book knowledge" to life experience, which is also what folks are looking for&#151;maybe even thirsting for.</P>
<P>So how does that relate to libraries? And how do libraries relate to community networking? In that Final Letter Tom asks "Would the role of librarians remain largely that of managing printed materials, or would it become that of managing community information--in whatever form?" </P>
<P>My knee-jerk reaction is that, of course, librarians will manage information in whatever form it's in; that's our job. We've managed print, and we've specialized as music librarians and art librarians, to mention a few of the non-print specialties. </P>
<P>The major part of library work has been managing large chunks of information, such as books. The Library of Congress classification and subject heading systems were designed to manage these large chunks. The smaller chunks found in periodicals and other serials are managed by indexes which have the hallmarks of subject heading systems if not classifications.</P>
<P>The Internet is, indeed, a horse of an entirely different wheelbase. A quick check of Google for materials about cataloging the Internet brought up a number of very interesting items, indicating that that concept may have been more daunting than originally thought. I find material on the Internet Public Library, <A href="http://www.ipl.org/ref/QUE/PF/orgweb.html">"Pathfinder: Organizing the Web -- Resources for Librarians,"</A> helpful in this regard as well as a piece by Anne Callery, a Yahoo cataloger, on <A href="http://www.library.ucsb.edu/untangle/callery.html">"Cataloging the Web."</A></P>
<P>To the extent that the radius contains people with knowledge that is already in print form and available through libraries and increasingly directly in electronic format on the net, community networkers don't have to worry about including it, let alone organizing it. There's no need to reinvent either the wheel or basic library cataloging systems.</P>
<P>But to the extent that the radius contains personal information, we need to consider collecting and organizing it. This personal information might be an individual's self-publishing of a web page to share his writing, his art, his philosophy. One of the things that we've been playing around with on <A href="http://www.chuh.net/"><SPAN style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">chuh.net</SPAN></A>, the Cleveland Heights-University Heights Community Network, is the idea of showcasing local talent&#151;from artists to writers, etc. This is indeed in keeping with the concept of the radius, concentrating on material that is unique to our community.</P>
<P>And I think that this material is complementary to another part of the radius, the information that citizens need to live productively and fully in their local communities and to participate in the governance of those communities. Most people outside a local community could not care less who won the city council or school board election and have no desire to discuss those matters. But the locals do. And the community networks make it possible to keep that information within reach (archiving) as well as to provide forums in which to discuss it. </P>
<P>And how will we organize this material? I think that most community networks are small enough so that organization has not been a major problem. Although there are site search mechanisms, it's a matter of pride for a librarian to arrange content logically enough so site searches should only be necessary as a last resort. </P>
<P>Early on in my career as a librarian, I was a cataloger in an academic library. The stereotype of catalogers is not pretty, but it is as mistaken as other stereotypes of librarians. Cataloging is an intellectual challenge and involves classification, subject headings, and description of the item being cataloged. We can bring those concepts to bear as we need them in organizing community networks. Try to keep a cataloger away from this challenge!</P>

<h3 class="title">Thinking Chaordically - The Future of Communities and Technology</h3>

<TABLE align=left border=0 cellPadding=5 cellSpacing=0 width=200>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><I><FONT size=-1>We have to look for power sources here, and distribution networks we were never taught, routes of power our teachers never imagined, or were encouraged to avoid...We have to find meters whose scales are unknown in the world, draw our own schematics, getting feedback, making connections, reducing the error, trying to learn the real function...</FONT></I></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD><FONT size=-1>&#151; Thomas Pynchon, <I>Gravity's Rainbow</I> (1972)</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Community networks (CNs) and community technology centers (CTCs) have evolved over the past fifteen years to provide a wide variety of services, ranging from training classes in neighborhood access centers (relatively low tech) to providing sophisticated networks that include Internet access and commercial quality information services (e.g., email, web hosting, database design, network management, etc.). For many years, these organizations (CNs and CTCs) were largely ignored, but the rise of the digital divide as a political issue and the changing landscape of the telecommunications industry have led to an interesting set of interlocking and conflicting challenges and opportunities.</P>
<P>The challenges focus on competitive pressures, a changing regulatory climate that continually redefines the "rules," and the need to constantly extend technological expertise. But opportunities also abound--increasing demand for services and a fragmented private sector that leaves many communities without adequate access and services.<BR><BR><BR></P>
<H2>A Chaordic Alliance</H2>
<P>We now live in a world of such complexity, diversity, and multiplicity of scales that there is little possibility of achieving constructive, sustained governance with existing concepts of organization. People, everywhere, are growing desperate for a renewed sense of community. Shared purpose and principles leading to new concepts of self-governance at multiple scales from the individual to the global have become essential (see Dee Hock, <I>Birth of the Chaordic Age</I>, San Francisco: Berett-Koehler, 1999, p. 90).</P>
<P>Dee Hock, the former CEO of VISA, the multinational credit card company, coined the term "chaordic alliance," the adjective being a combination of the words "chaos" and "order." Hock's vision is to create a new organization that is based not on traditional, hierarchical, topdown decision-making, but rather on shared purpose and consensus.</P>
<P>A chaordic alliance does not rely on heroic leadership to make decisions (and having the organization blindly follow), but rather the alliance does only those things that all the partners agree to in advance--that is, the organization initiates actions and activities only when all members of the alliance agree. This is a fundamentally different approach that discards the "I win--you lose" antagonism in favor of a collaborative model based on "I win--you win." Consensus is most likely to be reached when all parties find something of value in the outcome.</P>
<P>A chaordic technology alliance would have three primary, equal, and autonomous organizations, each with its own goals and services. These three organizations are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Community Technology Center (CTC) provides intra-community services. There may be one or more CTCs in a community. 
<LI>The Community Network (CN) provides services across an entire community, and may collaborate on programs and services with local CTCs. 
<LI>The Regional Technology Alliance (RTA) provides services across an entire region, and works collaboratively with CNs and CTCs on service and infrastructure projects too large for any individual CN or CTC to handle alone. </LI></UL>
<P>CTCs would continue to be independent organizations, but find it in their self-interest to collaborate with the local community network on projects or to share service costs (e.g., a community network may run a mail server for several CTCs). Similarly, CNs may collaborate with CTCs and other CNs as needed. The Regional Technology Alliance provides an organizational mechanism to facilitate the "coming together" of individual projects.</P>
<H2>Regional Technology Alliances</H2>
<P>RTAs could play many important roles, limited only by the interests and needs of the participating partners.</P>
<P><B>Regional network access and network administration</B>&#151;network access and administration is most effective and cost efficient when aggregated over a large area, ignoring political boundaries. RTAs can act as brokers to purchase Internet access and provide a Network Operations Center (NOC).</P>
<P><B>Server and services administration and support</B>--most services (e.g., email, web hosting, etc.) also benefit from aggregation. By spreading the cost of the most expensive technical support across many organizations, costs for all are reduced and local organizations have more staff time and budget to spend on delivering core services and avoiding much of the expense of back end systems.</P>
<P><B>Research and development</B>--RTAs could provide R&D support for member organizations, helping to push more sophisticated services and support out into user hands more quickly.</P>
<P><B>Training</B>--Support and training/education of staff who would work on the local level in CNs and CTCs. RTAs could provide less expensive and more frequent training opportunities.</P>
<P><B>Infrastructure development</B>--Telecommunications infrastructure development (such as for fiber and wireless transmission, colocation facilities) is also best done at the regional level, and requires technical expertise that most individual CNs and CTCs lack. </P>
<P>Each RTA might have a staff of 7-8 people plus a director. As the service arm of the chaordic alliance, the RTA would be dedicated to the success of the community networks and community technology centers. The RTA would never initiate projects on its own; it would always provide services and support to projects started by the member organizations of the alliance. These services and systems would never be forced upon a member of the alliance; a consensus would be needed before the RTA initiated an effort.</P>
<P>It would be essentially "invisible" to the public because it would have no public mission. The community networks and community technology centers would work on behalf of the public common good; the RTA would work on behalf of the common good of the chaordic alliance.</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>We live in a time when technology is becoming not just ubiquitous but pervasive--nearly every device we touch at home and at work may be "wired" in just a few years. Most of this wiring is being done by transnational corporations with little or no thought about the consequences and effects on individuals, communities, and the common good. Dee Hock asks: "Is this how things ought to be?"</P>
<P>The work of community technology centers and community networks is to ensure that technology supports human goals and aspirations, and that technology supports the growth and development of human relationships, not machine relationships. This commitment to the common good suggests that CNs and CTCs can become not just technology pioneers but organizational pioneers as well, seeking out and enacting new collaborative structures like Regional Technology Alliances.</P>

<h3 class="title">CTC Collaborations - Building the Timothy Smith Network in Boston, Part One</h3>

<P>The greatest challenges and opportunities facing community technology centers (CTCs) lie within their social, political and economic environment.&nbsp; Those that choose to collaborate will be in a stronger position to leverage scarce resources and capitalize on opportunities that exist. Those that don&#8217;t will struggle to effectively serve people and may find themselves unable to survive at all.</P>
<P>The CTC movement is now connected to other community economic and capacity building efforts and often finds itself in the middle of issues such as media literacy advocacy and telecommunications policy. In Boston, population and economic changes, new educational methods, changing telecommunications policies and technological advancements impact how CTC staff plan and implement programs that will meet the needs of their constituency. As a response to these challenges and opportunities, one group of close to forty CTCs decided to come together to work more closely. This is the story of that effort to build the Timothy Smith Network!</P>
<H2>Forces for Change</H2>
<P>Not long ago two forces came together in Boston. A small group of community technology leaders in the old Roxbury neighborhood formed a steering committee to plan how to collaborate more closely. This group included the Boston Neighborhood Network, Hattie B. Cooper Community Center, Casa Esperanza/Latinas y Ni&#164;os, Whittier Street Health Center, the Roxbury YMCA, and Roxbury Multi-Service Center. At roughly the same time, the Boston Foundation launched its <A href="http://www.tbf.org/current/neweconomy.html">New Economy Initiative</A>, an effort in collaboration with other funders and non-profit organizations to increase digital equity and ensure that low-income and minority populations have the skills and the support needed to participate in the &#8220;New Economy.&#8221; One of New Economy Initiative&#8217;s first grantees was the steering committee which asked us at <A href="http://www.summitcollaborative.com/">Summit Collaborative</A> to help them work with the larger group of close to forty centers in Old Roxbury to collectively develop an organizational framework and strategic plan for sustaining and enhancing the sites.</P>
<P>We guided the centers through a series of community meetings, part of the six-month strategic planning process, with task forces made up of community members working on various efforts.&nbsp; What we learned in the process validated some basic network building lessons and highlights for other CTCs as we look at what challenges lie ahead as they work to collaborate more closely.</P>
<H2>The Ying-Yang of Network Building</H2>
<P>The strategic plan developed by the community details programmatic and organizational development initiatives. Two tracks emerged to take action on: building the network institution itself while delivering services that strengthen the CTCs that are its members.&nbsp; The greatest lesson learned was that success on these two tracks is dependent on continued acknowledgement and attention to the two-way exchange of knowledge, human and financial assets between the centers themselves and the network.&nbsp; Over time this essential two-way exchange would require careful attention to leverage existing resources and knowledge that will be the lifeblood of the network's success. In addition care would need to be taken to prevent financial, human resource, and programmatic conflicts from spinning out of control and irreparably damaging the network&#8217;s survival. Responding to these needs four initiatives were identified as most important and attainable to take on in the network&#8217;s early stages of development:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Information and knowledge management activities to help all the centers learn from each other 
<LI>Coordination of all the center training and education programs to improve service delivery and efficiency 
<LI>Center staff professional development efforts to improve the technology skills of Timothy Smith computer center staff and volunteers who deliver and support programs for clients 
<LI>Building each center&#8217;s capacity by providing fundraising and strategic planning services </LI></OL>
<P>Taken collectively, this mix of programs will help the Roxbury community technology centers to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>improve their delivery of programs to clients; 
<LI>get assistance with deeper organizational development needs; and 
<LI>build a sustainable network that can serve as a hub of collaboration and leveraging between the centers over time. </LI></UL>

<h3 class="title">Closing The Resource Gap: 1-2-3 Advocacy to Improve Illinois Communities through Telecommunications, in Three Stages of Regulatory Competition, 1997-2001</h3>

<H3>Stage 1. Resources for Community Technology Centers from the regulatory process, 1997-1999</H3>
<P>In 1998, as part of the consolidation of Regional Bells, begun with SBC acquisition of PAC Tel the previous year, SBC reached an agreement to acquire Ameritech and filed a merger petition with the Illinois Commerce Commission for the Illinois part of the merger.&nbsp; Among participants in the 1998-99 merger proceeding before the ICC were several Community Intervenors, led by DSSA/Neighborhood Learning Network which had worked with community technology initiatives in low income areas of West Town and Bronzeville, especially via public housing sites and in links with schools.&nbsp; Other intervenors included the Chicago-based Community Workshop on Economic Development statewide coalition, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, the advisory committee to Chicago Housing Authority, and City Innovation, a community-business-education-public leadership support group.&nbsp; Over thirty groups endorsed and participated in the Bridging the Digital Divide Coalition's efforts, which included several public hearing on the West and South Sides of Chicago.&nbsp; These groups sought $25 to $65 million in community telecommunication program funds, along the lines of the agreement SBC had made in California to create a Community Technology Foundation.</P>
<P>The September 1999 merger order allocated $7.5 million for community and consumer initiatives, including $4.5 million for the establishment of <U><A href="http://www.ictf.org/">the Illinois Community Technology Fund</A></U> for a three year program to support community technology centers,&nbsp; and $3.0 M million for a separate telephone customer awareness program.</P>
<H3>Stage 2. Distributions from Illinois Community Technology Fund, and Enactment of Eliminate the Digital Divide Law by Illinois General Assembly, 2000-2001</H3>
<P>In early 2000, an eleven member board of the Illinois Community Technology Fund was appointed by the Illinois Commerce Commission to manage the programs and grants. ICTF issued an RFP in mid-2000 for grants up to $50,000 for community technology centers, and received over 375 applications requesting a total of $17 million.&nbsp; In the face of this major need, ICTF was able to make <U><A href="http://www.ictf.org/awardees.htm">$1.4 million in grants in spring 2001 to 42</A> <A name=_Hlt535394047></A></U>groups, and in early 2002 is expected to make another $1.6 million in grants.</P>
<P>On the legislative side, in January 2000 the now-renamed <U><A href="http://www.docChicago.net/">Digital Opportunity Coalition</A> </U>drafted a bill to provide state legislative resources for a comprehensive program of technology centers and IT training in many settings in low income and rural areas.&nbsp; Introduced by Representative Connie Howard, chair of House Computer Technology Committee, this bill passed the House, but not the Senate.&nbsp; A compromise at the end of the session allocated $1 million in the Eliminate the Digital Divide Law for a pilot program of grants to community technology centers in the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).&nbsp; With input from Digital Opportunity Coalition, the DCCA grant program was designed to supplement the ICTF grant program, and to be a part of the Bureau of Technology and Industrial Competitiveness along with other technology support and financing initiatives for small businesses, school-to-work, and manufacturing extension services.&nbsp; DCCA issued its Request for Proposals (RFP) in January 2001 and <U><A href="http://www.commerce.state.il.us/Press/pr062901.htm">made $1 million in Digital Divide grants to 24 community technology centers in June 2001</A> <A name=_Hlt535394269></A></U>, announced at the same time as Governor George Ryan signed the Telecommunications Rewrite Law which provided substantial new resources for underserved communities.&nbsp; The program is continuing and proposals in response to the <U><A href="http://www.commerce.state.il.us/digital_divide.htm">RFP for the 2002 awards</A> <A name=_Hlt535394426></A></U>were due last October.</P>
<H3>3. Expanded legislative funding through coordinated efforts and CTCNet Chicago Chapter networking, 2000-2001</H3>
<P>Many of the efforts described above were led by members of CTCNet in many capacities.&nbsp; In the summer of 2000, after the national CTCNet conference in Atlanta, several members decided to incorporate a Chicago Chapter that would include advocacy for new resources for centers as part of its mission. Led by CTCNet national board members and meetings at Charles Hayes Family Investment Center, CTCNet Chicago has 35 members, with committees on Professional Development, Resources and Advocacy, and Secretariat services housed at the <U><A href="http://www.luc.edu/depts/curl/prag/projects/technologywg/index.html">Policy Research and Action Group</A></U>, a four-university consortium, staffed at Loyola University.&nbsp; The Advocacy Committee, led by parties at Erie Neighborhood House, Chicago Jobs Council, and Metropolitan Planning Council, launched an effort in spring 2001 to increase funding for community technology centers and IT training, with a proposal for $9 million.</P>
<P>Other resources and advocacy activites developed during fall 2000-spring 2001 included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Mini-grants by DCCA, secured by Rep. Howard, to City Innovation and the Community Workshop on Economic Development, to serve as technical assistance providers during the spring 2000 legislative session. 
<LI><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol"></SPAN>Recommendations drafted by CTCNet Chicago and the Telecommunication Innovation and Access Network (successor to City Innovation) to expand IT training in underserved areas by the Chicago Jobs Council and State Agenda on Community Economic Development were introduced by Rep. Connie Howard; the bill passed the House, but not the Senate. 
<LI>Development of <U><A href="http://www.iccsonline.org/computerrecycling.html">Chicago Computer Recycling Network</A></U> to propose Computer Recycling Network legislation for the State of Illinois. 
<LI>Meetings with City of Chicago and suburban state legislators in their district offices, and CTCNet Chicago sponsorship of Tech Day in Springfield in May near the end of the legislative session. </LI></UL>
<P>As a result of these combined efforts and the overall pressures to improve telecommunication services, in May the General Assembly enacted a revised Illinois Telecommunications Act, a rewrite of the state&#8217;s basic statute on telecommunications regulation.&nbsp; The new law includes provision for payments by telephone companies of a minimum of $15 million into the DCCA Digital Divide Elimination Fund and $15 million into ICC Digital Divide Infrastructure Fund over three years, beginning in 2002.</P>
<H3>Stage 4:&nbsp; Looking Ahead</H3>
<P>Looking to 2002 and beyond, the following developments are anticipated: </P>
<UL>
<LI>The five-member Advisory Committee to the DCCA Digital Divide Elimination Fund will hold public hearings, expected February-March, on priorities for the three-year $15 million funding, with the CTCNet Chicago Advocacy Committee assisting with testimony by CTCs.&nbsp; The <U><A href="http://www.mtag.org/">Midwest Technology Access Group</A></U> has background on the fund and a survey tool for community leaders to vote on best ways to spend these funds. 
<LI><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol"></SPAN>Illinois Community Technology Fund and DCCA Computer Technology Center grant program will announce a total of $2.1 million in small grants to CTC's across the state, including afterschool centers and public agencies which have at least twelve hours per week of open public access. 
<LI>The Illinois Community Technology Fund will award a three year grant to a statewide Community Computer Center support program to assist in professional development of CTCs in urban, suburban and rural areas, and will build consortia of community technology center and community network and professional IT associations, and joint community-education-library-university community service programs.&nbsp; Many CTCs and CTC support organizations, community networks and university community service programs, including CTCNet Chicago, CTCNet national, and America Connects, have submitted consortium applications to undertake this statewide support activity. 
<LI><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol"></SPAN>A comprehensive Eliminate the Digital Divide bill, based on national model legislation developed by the IT Committee of the National Committee of Women Legislators, will be introduced in Illinois, including a major focus on workforce development.&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<P>The next three years will see statewide advocacy be integrated with calls for additional Federal support.&nbsp; For example, a proposed Digital Opportunity Information Trust includes plans for expansion of AmeriCorps and continued support from federal community technology programs.&nbsp; The agenda includes: High Tech School to Work and Computer Recycling Program development, Illinois Century Network expansion in nine service areas to include community technology centers, information infrastructure and planning initiatives in rural and urban areas (including Digital Town Halls as part of public health, and safety emergency networks), CivicNet telecommunication infrastructure deployment in the City of Chicago and near suburbs, and development of public-private community plans for parties seeking $15 million in Digital Divide Infrastructure Funds and ICC-collected universal service-related funds for near-phoneless populations.</P>
<P>This is one model of how urban, suburban and rural CTC constituencies can come together to combine program development with advocacy in the regulatory and legislative arenas, while demonstrating effective use of funds to achieve "sustainability" support from a combination of public agencies, foundations, companies, individual contributions, and revenues for services which improve the quality of life of less connected residents, often characterized in regulatory/legislative language as the "bottom third of the phone market." This goal goes back to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in which Congress sought to define "public convenience and necessity" of connecting all residential, commercial and institutional parties through state regulatory crafting of competitive markets which would serve all markets, including effective competition in the bottom third of the phone market (which includes the bottom tenth of the phoneless and near-phoneless).&nbsp; The goal is to assure that both private and cooperative private-public entities are working to provide effective and affordable information tools for every resident of the state of Illinois.</P>

<h3 class="title">Database and Directory Resources from the Organizer's Collaborative</h3>

<P><U><A href="http://organizenow.net/">The Organizers' Collaborative</A></U>, a non-profit group based in Boston, has begun to distribute a free database program for Windows PCs that is geared to the needs of membership groups (with 200-20,000 members) and grassroots organizing campaigns. ODB (Organizers' Database) was designed to be extremely accessible and easy to use, so as to reduce the support requirements typically incurred by nonprofit groups using complex software. It makes it easy to enter, sort, print, export, and import lists of people and organizations and can be shared by multiple users on a Local Area Network. ODB &nbsp;saves all data in a separate database file and automatically backs it up each month and includes a basic zip code lookup feature.&nbsp; For more information, see the <U><A href="http://organizenow.net/pdf/odb.pdf">"screen shots"</A></U> online or the <U><A href="http://organizenow.net/odbguide.pdf">full user manual</A></U>.</P>
<P>Organizers' Collaborative has a second project underway, called <U><A href="http://democracygroups.org/">Democracygroups.org</A></U>, which was developed almost entirely by <A href="http://organizenow.net/intern.html">student interns</A>. &nbsp;DemocracyGroups is a national directory of email lists that are oriented toward social change organizing.&nbsp; It is organized by issue, constituency, and geographic region. Not only is this in itself a valuable resources, but the mechanism by which the web site will be updated is also quite innovative, similiar to the <U><A href="http://dmoz.org/">Netscape Open Directory</A></U> in which dozens of editors help to keep the site up to date.&nbsp; We have about 40 editors who are helping out with screening the information that comes from the general public.&nbsp; The web site is written using Perl, and MySQL, both open source languages; a toolkit based on the source code is under preparation. &#8212; <A href="mailto:rich@organizenow.net">Rich Cowan</A></P>

<h3 class="title">On the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil</h3>

<P>Paradoxically, recent global NGO mega-events, such as the <A href="http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/">World Social Forum</A> <A name=_Hlt1100353></A>, are organized and flourish largely because of the Internet, yet fail to include in their program in depth discussions about the issues surrounding connectivity, free software, local content production for online distribution, and links to democratic initiatives. The WSF was no exception to what is becoming an unfortunate norm whereby the mainline and single issue NGOs ignore relevant IT issues that are discussed in separate events like <A href="http://www.globalcn2001.org/">GlobalCN2001</A> <A name=_Hlt1100765></A><A name=_Hlt1100824></A><A name=_Hlt1100753></A>. This suggests an "issue divide" among progressive groups.&nbsp; Only one workshop out of hundreds was devoted to these issues at the WSF (30 Jan-5 Feb 2002) in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Organized by the <A href="http://www.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/telecentros">Porto Alegre municipal government's IT office</A>&nbsp; in conjunction with <A href="http://www.procergs.com.br/">Rio Grande de Sul's impressive state government IT office</A>, a full day was devoted to the local and state experiences in policy design and concrete telecenter experiences. At the end of the day on Saturday workshop participants were bussed to the outskirts of this balmy city of 1.3 million in order to witness a new telecenter's inauguration by the tech savvy mayor, Tarso Gerno.</P>
<P>The state government IT office announced its forthcoming <U><A href="http://www.softwarelivre.rs.gov.br/">Free Software International Forum</A></U>, scheduled for 2-4 May 2002. Only one other workshop on the program, "Science and Technology: An Instrument for Peace in the 21st Century,&#8221; focused on kindred issues. The effervescence of Chomsky's inaugural address, I. Wallerstein's menu for fighting global capitalism (raise wage and service demands globally&#8230;), and the presence many international luminaries (and has-beens), plus the top leadership of Brazil's surging Partido del trabalho (PT), offered a ritual reaffirmation of the 50,000 attendees&#8217; commitment to their respective causes and reinforced networking among the multidimensional caucuses present for the six day event. While many Brazilians were pleased with the event being labelled the "Woodstock of the Left,&#8221; it was evident the global Left requires periodic mutual reassurance while struggling to focus on the strategic issues and offer concrete plans for action.

<h3 class="title">Addendum to A Mixed Picture</h3>

<P>On February 4, 2002, President Bush released his budget request. The proposal calls for eliminating two successful community technology programs -- one at the Department of Commerce, the other at the Department of Education -- and increasing a HUD program that allows funds to be used for community technology programs but does not require it. </P>
<P>Echoing the priorities for community technology laid out in the FY '02 budget proposal, the Department of Education Community Technology Centers program, which is currently funded at $32.5 million, would be eliminated, in favor of an effort under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Neighborhood Networks program, currently funded at $20 million (divided between $15 million under the Public Housing Capital Fund and $5 million under HOPE VI programs). The President's FY '03 request for Neighborhood Networks is for level funding. There has been no information available, to date, as to exactly how the program will allocate funds, or if/when funding will be available on a competitive basis for community technology center applicants.</P>
<P>The FY '03 budget also calls for level-funding of $1 billion for the Department of Education's 21st Century Learning Centers program, to establish or expand academic enrichment opportunities for students and learning opportunities for their families outside of school hours-- during the week, weekends, and summer periods-- in school districts with high concentrations of poverty and/or low-performing schools. Money would be available to the states through formula grants, which are then distributed to local school districts on a competitive basis. The Department's Educational Technology State Grants, an initiative to boost technology integration in classroom environments into which the Department's existing Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology, Technology Innovation Challenge Grants, and Technology Leadership Activities would be folded, is also be level-funded at $700.5 million. The effort would continue to provide formula grants to the states, which in turn would distribute half to all districts by formula, and the remainder to the most high-need districts, to acquire technology skills, expertise, and training resources. The President's request also includes level funding of $25 million for AmeriCorps/VISTA information technology training efforts directed towards students and teachers in low-income areas. </P>
<P>The biggest change, however, is the outright elimination of the Technology Opportunities Program under the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration, which Congress funded at $12.4 million this year. To date, the three-year old CTC program has distributed more than $100 million in matching grants&nbsp; to develop or expand community technology access points and centers for information and telecommunications technology in the context of educational services and skills training for those lacking such access at home, work or school. The seven-year old TOP program has, to date, awarded 530 grants, across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Virgin Islands, totaling $192.5 million grants leveraged by $268 million in matching funds from local sources, to support public-private efforts to develop the national advanced telecommunications and information technology infrastructure for delivery of social services -- including education, health, employment, and public safety -- to underserved rural and urban areas across the country. </P>
<P>These programs have proved extremely effective as evidenced by a new Commerce Department report, "A Nation Online" released on Feb. 5. The report found Internet use among the poorest households in 2001 increased by 25%, among blacks by 33%, and among Hispanics by 30%. Households headed by single mothers had a 29% increase in Internet usage, the highest growth rate among different types of households.<BR></P>

<h3 class="title">A Mixed Picture - Telecom Policy Update and Analysis</h3>

<IMG align=left height=190 src="/winter-spring-2002/img/RyanBW.gif" width=165><STRONG>Please Note:&nbsp; </STRONG><A href="article.php?article_id=79"><STRONG>Addendum on community technology funding status.</STRONG></A>
<P>Recently-passed FY '02 appropriations present a mixed picture for federal community technology funding. Congress may very well have approved increased funding for technology programs, at levels above what the President requested, but it&#8217;s hard to assess the nature of what actually was increased, and more importantly the rhyme and reason as to why.</P>
<P>The Bush Administration's original budget request emphasized consolidation into block grants, or outright elimination, of individual technology access and education programs across agencies-- especially those thought to be duplicating efforts and perceived as inaccessible to small, local community efforts.&nbsp; The Administration's request included zero-funding of the Education Department&#8217;s CTC program, and the subsequent establishment of a similar effort under the Department of Housing and Urban Development Neighborhood Networks program, at a funding level of $80 million. While this would have represented an increase in the amount spent for community technology overall, in keeping with his campaign pledge, it also raised concerns among supporters and current recipients of the Education Department grants. Among them were fears that support for existing projects, funded by three-year matching grants, might be at risk, as well as the America Connects Consortium, the only federally-sponsored CTC coordination, improvement, and outreach network.</P>
<P>So how did community technology fare, overall? The Department of Education's <U><A href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/ovae/ctc">Community Technology Centers program</A></U>, funded at $65 million in FY '01, will receive $32.5 million under the Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill passed by Congress in late December. The <U><A href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top">Technology Opportunities Program</A></U>, housed under the Department of Commerce's National Technology Infrastructure Administration, receives $15 million (only $12.4 million of which is actually available for new grants) under the FY '02 Commerce-Justice-State appropriations signed into law last November--down 65% from $45 million in FY '01. But the Department of Housing and Urban Development's <A href="http://www.hud.gov/nnw/nnwindex.html">Neighborhood Networks</A>&nbsp;program--an initiative which has received no funding for centers since its inception in 1995--will receive a total of $20 million in VA-HUD spending under the Public Housing Capital Fund and HOPE VI funds to revitalize severely distressed public housing.</P>
<P>In addition, there is $25 million earmarked under appropriations for the Corporation for National Service for &#8220;activities dedicated to developing computer and information technology skills for students and teachers in low-income communities&#8221;; $120 million (down from $150 million in FY &#8217;01) for the Department of Labor&#8217;s One Stop network, which coordinates federal, state, and local employment education and training resources providing both facilities and online access to job and career information and resources; and the lengthy number of specific earmarks under the Department of Education&#8217;s Fund for Improving Education which are directed, in a number of cases, for improving the technology capacity of individual schools, libraries, and educational facilities.</P>
<P>On a simple level, one could say that some programs gained or lost funding, quite possibly at the expense of one another. If this is indeed the case, the FY &#8217;02 funding picture would only underscore the piecemeal approach with which community technology has been handled across agencies, and maybe by the overall community of interests itself, over the past few years.</P>
<P>The Education Department CTC program provides matching grants to develop access points for computers, information and telecommunications technology in the context of educational services and skills training for those lacking such access at home, work or school. TOP supports public-private efforts to help develop the national advanced telecommunications and information technology infrastructure for social services delivery&#8212;including education, health, employment, and public safety&#8212;to underserved rural and urban areas across the country. Neighborhood Networks supports partnerships to establish multi-service central points utilizing information technology in areas of low- and moderate-income multi-family housing. There are technology access, training and technical assistance, and demonstration initiatives administered by a number of other federal agencies targeted towards specific audiences and the general population.</P>
<P>There have been complaints that because the funding is difficult to access, administer, or sustain, existing federal programs are not worth applying to. Obstacles include burdensome application and reporting procedures, financial and resource barriers to participation, and competition from groups with more experience, expertise, presence, and/or political influence. There have been arguments that some federal programs, a number of which were very close to being eliminated this past legislative session, are not worth advocating for, because they address complementary goals only in the abstract and programmatically serve a disparate range of competing interests&#8212;schools, libraries, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and other community institutions&#8212;in an uncoordinated manner.</P>
<P>It would be one thing if these criticisms came from voices skeptical of federal monies spent as investments in community-building and human development in an uncertain economic environment. It is surprising to hear, then, that these sentiments are coming from within the larger community technology community itself, which gets back again to the lack of sustainable coordination among its diverse members. Rather than focusing on specific issues and particular programs in the area of education technology, workforce development, information access, civic participation, specific populations, economic investment and infrastructure development, and others, some advocates feel that all of these interests need to start advocating for one another under a broader, organized, cooperative, coordinated community technology banner. Recent developments, at least within the Education Department, suggest that such an effort might actually have an incentive to be mobilized and active during the next appropriations round for fiscal year 2003 and beyond.</P>
<P>In response to the concerns that small groups and local players are shut out of federal funding and grants opportunities, the Education Department posted its final rules regarding competitive funding on November 30, 2001, allowing the Secretary of Education latitude in holding separate competitive rounds for, or assigning competitive preference to, novice applicants in discretionary grant programs.&nbsp; As others have pointed out, the recently passed Education bill will have a potentially tremendous impact on community technology programming, if not funding, in at least three ways.</P>
<P>First, there is actual authorizing language for the first time specifically for the Community Technology Centers program under the Education Department. This is important because Congress is not technically supposed to appropriate funds to programs that have no authorization (although this is often overlooked). This means that the program itself can be considered among specific appropriations items, rather than funded through another program&#8217;s authority. Paradoxically, this also means that without any political support, the program can just as easily be eliminated from the budget. Second, the bill adds authority for 150 projects and seven state efforts to receive waivers from Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) program rules in order to sign self-determined &#8220;accountability contracts&#8221; and performance goals with the Secretary of Education&#8212;thus either raising or lowering the bar for participation by diverse entrants in the educational arena to deliver on a range of educational goals. Third, the Education bill gives local school districts and states the ability to transfer up to 50% of the federal monies they receive for a specific program to a range of programs under ESEA, without requiring federal permission to do so. Thus, federal funds originally targeted for class size reduction or teacher salaries could conceivably be transferred for community-based technology educational efforts on an annual, non-permanent basis.</P>
<P>While promising to offer education efforts a higher incentive for innovation and partnership, and a greater degree of flexibility to target funds for specific needs without layers of bureaucratic obstacles, the Education bill potentially binds disparate technology and non-technology education priorities together, to be addressed at the expense of one another, without guaranteed consistency from school year to school year.</P>
<P>Add to this picture the shifting sense of post-September 11 domestic spending priorities, borne out by FY &#8217;02 appropriations, and we have the following mixed signal summary:</P>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>Slightly less money than requested is available for direct technology block grants to states; <BR>
<LI>More money for technology for education-related content; <BR>
<LI>No money requested or provided for school-based technology literacy; <BR>
<LI>No money requested or provided for technology innovation in education or community development; <BR>
<LI>Significantly more money than requested for teacher training for technology <BR>
<LI>No money for education technology leadership development; <BR>
<LI>More money than requested for community technology models to support education and lifelong learning (with a sharp bias towards school/after-school based facilities); <BR>
<LI>Less money for workforce training and development-focused technology service delivery; <BR>
<LI>Less money for critical community information and communications technology infrastructure innovation.</LI></UL>
<P>A big question in search of an answer is what exactly is the priority for community technology policy from among funding, training, capacity building, evaluation, expansion or replication of best practices, tax benefits and credits for items ranging from broadband deployment to equipment donations? The degree to which the range of federal, state, local, private, and other resources is uncoordinated and even aimed towards competing ends with other efforts is a big obstacle currently preventing a clear, effective vision of community technology policy from emerging as the term &#8220;digital divide&#8221; loses its potency in the political landscape.</P>
<P>Given the current economic uncertainty around sustainable funding for new and existing programs, there is heightened urgency thrust upon the broader community of technology access interests to articulate their needs for coordinated federal investments to help spur innovative and effective approaches to technology access, knowledge and skills, and utilization for individual and community development and participation in civic, social, and economic life. Otherwise, there is strong likelihood that complementary program interests will be pitted against one another&nbsp;in a contest for survival.</P>
<P>In late 2001, for example, as much as $390 million available under the E-Rate program&#8212;under which fees are collected from telecommunications firms by way of consumers in order to provide a range of discounted telecommunications services to schools and libraries&#8212;was slated to be funneled to support expansion of the Rural Health Care program. RHC is a universal service initiative designed by the Federal Communications Commission to provide discounts on telecommunication services to rural health care providers for telemedicine and telehealth efforts. Because the discount is limited to the difference between rates charged to urban and rural providers, the program, which only receives up to $10 million annually, has never enjoyed the popularity of E-Rate, which can collect up to $400 million annually. Post-September 11<SUP>th</SUP> fears around the inadequacy of existing public health telecommunications dissemination infrastructure prompted House Commerce Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-LA) to introduce legislation expanding the scope of RHC to that of E-Rate, but for all funds above RHC&#8217;s current floor of $10 million yet below $400 million to come from the E-Rate fund for the next two years&#8212;ensuring support for an increase in applications, without raising fees collected from telecom firms and their customers. Concerned that such an arrangement would jeopardize funding for school and library telecommunication connections and services, E-Rate supporters worked with House Commerce Ranking Member Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) on compromise language that instead would divert <B>all</B> traditional TOP funding for two years to support RHC expansion for urban, rural and Native American telemedicine projects&#8212;even though TOP currently supports a number of projects in this area. Senators Kennedy (D-MA) and Frist (R-TN) introduced a companion bill to Chairman Tauzin&#8217;s legislation that called for increasing the information and communications technology equipment capacity for health care providers, but without use of TOP or E-Rate to fund expansion or federal-state coordination of such efforts. The Tauzin-Dingell&#8217;s bio-terrorism bill passed by an overwhelming vote in the House, while the full Senate has yet to consider S.1765 as of this writing.</P>
<P>Existing federal programs have come to emphasize collaboration among important community- based and community-focused actors and institutions, to produce a body of successful and replicable program models. Much political capital and policy muscle has been expended to establish the existing set of federal opportunities available. Yet even now, the overall participant and recipient base has not been effective in sustaining widespread support and visibility on the Hill, or among the public, around broader community technology policy goals and objectives&#8212;though the number of applicants and need continues to grow in inverse proportion to the number of resources available. This has led to a shift away from rallying cries attacking the digital divide, and towards the daunting question of &#8220;access to what, by whomever is most deserving, towards what end?&#8221;</P>
<P>If there is any chance for a coordinated community technology policy effort to be actively engaged in deliberations around what resources are available and how they will be applied to meet pressing needs, there has got to be more involvement in the full continuum of activities where presence is important.&nbsp; This means identifying gaps or shortcomings with respect to current activity and resources and pushing for corrective measures within the national policy arena, by establishing early and continued contact with lawmakers and policymakers at the national and local level.&nbsp; It means encouraging and assisting groups to apply for existing funding, and serving as reviewers for grant opportunities to help nullify the potential for bias or misdirection of program focus. It means developing and utilizing expertise and technical assistance to ensure that program oversight and operations are less daunting for new and smaller players and so that innovation and promising practices can grow and replicate where they are so desperately needed. It means raising the visibility of community technology efforts across the country among citizens in every community where they exist and operate. </P>
<P>A healthy community technology policy effort means cooperating with each and every set of community technology interests in order to protect what&#8217;s available now, and to nurture what could be possible in the future.</P>

<h3 class="title">Northern New Mexico's Last Mile Technology: Wireless Service!</h3>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">With the 
  growing use of the worldwide Internet, communication companies are providing 
  high bandwidth fiber optic backbones to connect communities to the rest of the 
  world. Left behind are the small rural towns and villages that communication 
  companies cannot economically servicing. Broadband fixed wireless technology 
  is providing a competitive alternative to solve this "last mile" or in many 
  cases the last fifty miles of connectivity to bring technological equality to 
  these small communities. <a href="http://www.laplaza.org/">La Plaza Telecommunity</a>, 
  a nonprofit 501c3 community technology center and network, is located in northern 
  New Mexico's remote, rural community, Taos, NM. La Plaza has a three-fold mission:</font></p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Providing 
    Internet access with dialup email accounts and 4 free public access sites;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Education 
    and training, and;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">A virtual 
    community website. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">La Plaza 
  began services in 1994 with a T1 line and 24 modems, 1 free public access site, 
  and free classes in Introduction to Email. In 1996 La Plaza installed two 56Kbps 
  lines, a server and 5 modems in the villages of Questa (25 miles north of Taos) 
  and Penasco (26 miles southeast of Taos) for dialup access and public access 
  sites in each village, as the telecom had no plans to install fiber optic cable 
  to these areas.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Questa 
  Wireless Broadband Initiative</font></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><img name="n1128LaPlaza" src="/winter-spring-2002/img/1128LaPlaza.gif" width="270" height="196" border="0" align="right" hspace="5">In 
  1998, La Plaza collaborated with the New Mexico Dept of Communication and developed 
  a <a
href="http://www.nasca.org/awards/ppa.cfm">microwave radio wireless system with 
  T1 speed</a> for the Village of Questa. This system showcased to the New Mexico 
  State Legislature public/private partnerships in using State microwave towers 
  to develop broadband Internet services into rural areas that will never have 
  fiber optic capabilities. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Penasco 
  School District, serving 800+ students, became aware of the Questa wireless 
  model and in 1999 requested La Plaza to develop a similar wireless system for 
  their computer labs and classrooms; thus, the Penasco Project was developed. 
  The Penasco Project had some unusual demands, far from the normal WAN installations. 
  The task was to provide Internet connectivity to the rural community of Penasco, 
  located in northern New Mexico and surrounded by mountains on all sides. La 
  Plaza was the closest ISP, some 26 miles to the North, with Picuris Peak, a 
  10,800-foot peak directly in line between the two towns. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Collaboration 
  for this project required many partners including La Plaza, Penasco School District, 
  U.S. Forest Service, La Serna Land Grant (who claims ownership of the property 
  on the Picuris Peak), Integrity Networking Systems, La Jicarita Enterprises, 
  and a private snow mobile company. La Plaza applied and received permission 
  to use the U.S. Forest Service Ranger Station tower and outbuilding atop Picuris 
  Peak. </font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">One Wireless 
  Technology Solution</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><img src="/winter-spring-2002/laplaza_diagram.png" width="320" height="278" align="left" hspace="10">Wireless 
  equipment manufacturers have designed radios for specific use in Wide Area Networks, 
  WANs. These radios, designated Wireless Ethernet Bridges, are designed to be 
  fully compatible with computer networking standards. They have standard Ethernet 
  interfaces, 10baseTX or 100BaseTX, which are connected by a standard RJ-45 connector. 
  Many bandwidth options are available from several hundred Kbps to over 100 Mbps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><a
href="http://www.wmux.com/company/resource_center/app_tsunami.html">Tsunami radios</a>, 
  manufactured by Western Multiplex, were selected for the Penasco Project. These 
  Wireless Bridges operate in the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical 
  (ISM) band of 2.4 Ghz and do not require FCC licensing. The wavelength is not 
  affected by adverse weather of rain or snow. The radios have a wide temperature 
  operating range, necessary for locating at the mountain peak where extreme temperatures 
  are common. The radios operate over a wide range of DC voltage, lending themselves 
  to be powered by a solar / storage battery power supply. The radios also provide 
  the maximum RF output allowed by FCC regulation for that frequency. New wires 
  were placed on the tower to ensure proper leverage for placement of the antennas, 
  golf batteries were installed in the outbuilding and 18 solar panels were installed 
  surrounding the outbuilding to supplement the existing systems in place that 
  powered the government and private transmitters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The following 
  is an account by the Integrity engineer of the actual install: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">"The original 
    schedule called for installation during the late summer of 1999. By the time 
    all the approvals from the government agencies and the landowners were obtained 
    it was February 28, 2000 when the install was attempted. Reaching the top 
    of Picuris Peak at that time of year was a major accomplishment in itself. 
    Three snowmobiles were rented and the services of a mountain guide were obtained. 
    The trail wound around the mountain and next to shear cliffs, sometimes through 
    snowdrifts deeper than one could stand. One snowmobile pulled a large sled 
    loaded with radio gear including two large 2-ft diameter antennas. Over the 
    more than six-mile trip up the mountain the sled and pulling snowmobile tipped 
    over and got stuck several times. It took approximately 2.5 hours to reach 
    the ranger station atop the peak. It was a bright sunny day. The air was 
    clear and crisp, and you could see for miles to the horizon. The sun was 
    warming and the temperature was about 35 degrees. As we worked we noticed 
    the air was thin and we tired more quickly. We quickly got the first link 
    up and running and measured very close to the calculated signal strength. 
    The second link was installed with equal success and we started to pack up 
    our equipment as the day was waning and the temperature was dropping. As 
    we started down the mountain the snow was wet and heavy. As we approached 
    the bottom of the mountain we encountered large segments of the trail that 
    had turned to mud. The unusually warm day, which gave us some comfort at 
    the top of the mountain, had melted the shallow snow layer at the base of 
    the mountain. The snowmobile pulling the sled had a great deal of difficulty 
    traveling through the mud. Several times the sled would get bogged down and 
    the drive belt of the snowmobile slipped and burned. About a mile before 
    we reached the meadow next to the parking area, all the snow was gone and 
    an ATV had to haul personnel and equipment through the mud."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">With wireless 
  link in place, the Penasco school computer labs were able to connect to La Plaza 
  Telecommunity for Internet access. The link provided T1 bandwidth at a reasonable 
  initial cost and no recurring monthly fee. The 800+ students enjoy T1 speed, 
  as does the public access site sponsored by La Plaza. Through cooperation with 
  the school, other organizations in the Penasco area are able to have fast Internet 
  access. One such organization is the La Jicarita Enterprise Zone office based 
  in Penasco, which provides economic development and e-commerce opportunities 
  to over 9,500 native New Mexicans in three Northern New Mexico counties. The 
  entire Penasco Valley and neighboring communities now have broadband Internet 
  access that would otherwise not be available.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Bridging 
  the Digital Divide With Wireless</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This leading 
  edge technology is worthy of recognition due to the many challenges of the remote, 
  rural and mountainous location populated by a tricultural peoples. The U.S. 
  Department of Commerce measures the Digital Divide by household connectivity 
  as a means of determining which Americans are connected to the nation's telecommunications 
  and information infrastructure. In 1998, they found penetration levels differ, 
  often substantially, according to income, race, geography, education level, 
  among other demographic characteristics. The Penasco Valley has the top 4 demographic 
  characteristics of low penetration rates with respect to computers and Internet 
  access. The Penasco Project and La Plaza provides for the entire Penasco community 
  broadband T1 Internet speed, free public access to both computers and the Internet, 
  and free training classes. The Penasco Schools now offer similar educational 
  opportunities to their students as schools in urban and metroplex areas. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The previous 
  solution of the 56Kbps phone line for Internet access to this Village is far 
  surpassed with the wireless system. Penasco Schools is the only school district 
  in New Mexico that is using the existing technology of broadband fixed wireless 
  Internet access. The telecom has no plans to lay fiber now or in the future 
  and without the new wireless system, the schools, enterprise zone offices, and 
  private citizens would continue to be left behind on the information highway. 
  The technology surpasses current solutions as it is less expensive, easier to 
  install, faster and more efficient, takes one day's time of installation, and 
  accessible as a solution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The application 
  of wireless technology is making a huge contribution to this low-income, geographically 
  challenged community. The school district has in place a state-of-the-art Internet 
  access wireless system for educational purposes. La Plaza provides a Community 
  Outreach Trainer, 15 hours weekly, and has an agreement with Penasco Schools 
  to use the High School computer lab as a public access site. The students use 
  the site to complete homework and research paper assignments. During the school 
  year, there are 300 monthly visits in the site; during the summer, there are 
  350 monthly visits. A community college, 28 miles south of Penasco, offers 
  distance education courses for the Penasco teachers and these teachers often 
  visit the public access site to complete assignments. La Plaza received a grant 
  from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to train northern NM teachers how to integrate 
  the Internet into their class activities. Sixteen of the Penasco teachers were 
  trained and became trainers for the other classroom teachers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Community 
  members use the site to access email and information on the WWW. Also, La Plaza 
  received a funding from a local foundation to develop a training model for at-risk 
  youth in web design. Six Penasco students are involved in this project. They 
  use the digital equipment, located at the La Jicarita Enterprise office and 
  purchased by La Plaza, to complete their assignments in web development. La 
  Plaza plans to integrate the web development classes in the high school, for 
  not only at-risk youth, but also other interested youth in the Penasco area.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The project 
  contribution is a wired community in a remote, rural, and mountainous area. 
  The future educational and professional contribution is unknown, but we do know 
  without the wireless application this village would remain forever in the Digital 
  Divide "have-nots" of computer and Internet access.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">La Plaza 
  reports project results to the La Plaza Board of Directors, Penasco School Board, 
  and the funding sources of the special projects; i.e.; number of dialin users 
  for email accounts, number of students enrolled in Penasco schools, number of 
  visits in the Penasco public access site, and the positive outcomes of the special 
  projects available through this wireless system. To date, no one has considered 
  this project to be problematic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This project 
  can be replicated in any community, whether remote, rural or mountainous. La 
  Plaza has installed wireless systems to the Town of Taos municipal offices, 
  the county hospital, private businesses, and has a pending project for the Taos 
  Pueblo. The model is based on the geographical challenges and the lack of telecom 
  infrastructure in the area. Any community that is willing to develop partnerships 
  and collaborate with need, engineering design, finances, and solution can replicate 
  this project. A PowerPoint <a
href="http://www.laplaza.org/about_lap/network/wirelessPresentation2/pages/11.htm">presentation 
  of the project</a> is available online.</font></p>

<h3 class="title">Providing Resources to VISTA</h3>

<p><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/CropLookForward.jpg" width="133" height="224" alt="Humble Author" align="left">"What's 
  a VISTA Leader?" That's a question I get a lot when people hear what I'm doing 
  now, working in that capacity for <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">the 
  Community Technology Center (CTC) VISTA Project</a>. We are a national program 
  and currently have close to 50 AmeriCorps*VISTA members working in CTCs across 
  the US, helping people in low-income and underserved communities use computers 
  in a wide variety of ways. I work at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, 
  where the project is based. VISTA, as I explain to people who ask, is part of 
  AmeriCorps. <a
href="http://www.americorps.gov/">AmeriCorps</a> is like the Peace Corps, but 
  takes place within the US rather than in other countries, and for a term of 
  one year. VISTA and AmeriCorp members are differentiated by the type of work 
  each does. An AmeriCorps member might be teaching a Microsoft Word class. A 
  VISTA would be the one who writes the curriculum for the same class. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.realchangenews.org/"><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/RCLogo.gif" width="211" height="90" alt="Real Change" border="0" align="right"></a>VISTA 
  Leaders have successfully completed at least one year as a VISTA. This ensures 
  VISTA Leaders have some sense of what their VISTAs are going through. During 
  my first year of service, I worked as the MacWorkshop Coordinator at <i><u><a
href="http://www.realchangenews.org/">Real Change</a></u></i>, a homeless newspaper 
  (in Seattle, WA) that also has a computer lab with six Macintoshes open to the 
  public. There I recruited volunteers to be lab monitors, develop and teach 
  classes and workshops, provide general technical support, and revamp and staff 
  our computer giveaway program. The biggest difference between this year and 
  last year: last year I was so busy working with volunteers I didn't get very 
  much time to be in front of a computer to work on projects. This year I am in 
  front of a computer much of the day &#150; quite a different work dynamic!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realchangenews.org/"><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/Dec_15_00_cover.gif" width="202" height="248" border="0" alt="Real Change Cover Page" align="left"></a>I 
  am the first VISTA Leader for this project so there is a lot of new territory 
  I'm discovering. I've done some work on the project's web site, and I have 
  first contact with all the online VISTA applicants who express an interest in 
  signing up with our program, no small task since we've been told we're the most 
  popular and sought after program in <u><a href="https://recruit.cns.gov/">the 
  entire VISTA recruitment system</a></u>. I am in touch with approximately ten 
  new VISTAs each week.</p>
<p>The main responsibility of a VISTA Leader is to provide resources to VISTAs 
  and act as an advocate for them. My major focus is helping CTC VISTAs present 
  their work and experiences. We are using the web as the medium to present our 
  work because the web is an excellent way to communicate with people who are 
  geographically disperse and it's so integral to everyone's work in the project; 
  we want people to be able to present their work and their programs, and having 
  the experience of developing a web site can give people an important tool.</p>
<p>CTC VISTA technology experience varies widely. Some are already very good 
  web designers and others are learning. VISTAs who have designed their own sites 
  send me Internet links. For those who are learning or want additional tools, 
  I created <u><a
href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/users/bigchainring/rchome.htm">a site about my own 
  VISTA experience last year</a> .</u> Some VISTAs use this as an idea; some 
  cut and paste their own text and pictures into the design. Some just don't 
  have the time or the desire to learn how to make a web site; they send me some 
  text and pictures and I develop a site displaying their experience. These are 
  all gathered in one place to show <u><a
href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/directory2.html">the incredible diversity 
  of CTC VISTA work</a> </u> that's being done. </p>
<p>I like to use what I know to help other people. I'm interested in project 
  management and leadership and I like to help people learn about computers. 
  These are some of the reasons I sought out this particular opportunity. I love 
  what I do now, though it is not always easy, but I hope to learn many new things 
  along this journey as a VISTA Leader.</p>
