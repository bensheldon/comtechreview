<div class="category_title">Parks and Recreation LAPs Are "Connected" for the Future</div> <span class="posted">by Pam Earle and Cathy Matheson</span>




<p><a href="http://www.nrpa.org/"><img name="PamLAP0123" src="/winter-spring-2002/img/PamLAP0123.jpg" width="252" height="252" border="0" align="left" alt="National Parks and Recreation Association"></a>Parks 
  and Recreation Services are naturally positioned to become local technology 
  centers. Parks and Recreation department services have historically been mandated 
  to meet the social, physical, and educational needs of citizens. Through building 
  the physical structures and the opportunities to bring community together, Parks 
  and Rec has fostered community pride, and created relationships that help sustain 
  vital, healthy communities. It is here where we have established cultural, 
  social, and educational places where our community comes together. </p>
<p>Parks and Recreation departments are masters in creating successful partnerships 
  to achieve mutual gain. Be it a partnership between a non-profit and education 
  organization, a partnership between government and a corporation, leisure professionals 
  know how to develop key win-win relationships. For many years, they have struggled 
  to increase their services with fewer financial resources. Even faced with 
  the challenges of "doing more with less," Parks and Recreation departments serve 
  more children during after school hours than any other local agency. They are 
  known as the places where people "cluster." They are safe, welcoming, and nurturing 
  environments for people of all ages, cultures and abilities.</p>
<p>Parks and Recreation Department Centers are perfect sponsors for LAPs because 
  they're open long hours and provide community resources that include day-care 
  services, volunteers and volunteer infrastructure, and access to information 
  and technology that might not be available and affordable elsewhere.</p>
<p>As Andrew Cohill, President of the Association for Community Networking, put 
  it: "Just as recreation centers and parks create gathering places for community 
  residents of all ages, community-wide networks create online gathering places, 
  and the intersection of these two mediums (physical and virtual) creates great 
  opportunities &#8212; for technology centers, for learning centers, for technology fairs, 
  community networked offices, and other creative uses."</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3>The <a
href="http://www.nrpa.org/"><b>National Recreation and Park Association</b></a> 
  is taking a lead in encouraging the development of public access to technology 
  at Parks and Recreation sites. The NRPA represents over 24,000 citizens and 
  professionals in 5,000 or more communities around the country. There is great 
  opportunity for public Parks and Recreation to add value to existing services 
  through technology based programs and for the public to enjoy the added benefit 
  of connecting with their community in new ways. We are not surprised to see 
  Parks and Recreation programs and staff emerging as leaders in creating the 
  foundation for new and sustainable "local access places." </p>
<p class=MsoBodyText3>The following are some examples of Parks and Recreation 
  based programs that represent successful models, as reported by those who staff 
  and work at them.</p>
<span class="subhead">Public Recreation in Largo, Florida</span>
<p>Technology is creating a shift in the recreation programming paradigm with 
  intergenerational applications of computer training through public recreation 
  in Largo. The many requests about where senior citizens could learn to use 
  computers led our staff to develop a partnership at the Community Center with 
  the city's Recreation, Parks and Arts Department, the Pinellas County Technical 
  Education Center (PTEC), and a private computer education company (that has 
  since gone out of business.) The Community Center offered space and furniture, 
  and scheduling, accounting and advertising services as well as youth members 
  to serve as computer mentors for seniors. PTEC offered the loan and up-keep 
  of 14 state-of-the-art computer systems and trained instructors. The computer 
  education company supplied workbooks and a large collection of interactive, 
  learn-on-your-own programs for various software applications.</p>
<p>The program objectives were designed to create increased mutual esteem for 
  the generations involved through educational interaction; e-mail was actually 
  the number one reason and stimulus motivating senior citizens to learn to use 
  the computer.</p>
<p>Begun in January, 2000, the program became an immediate success because of 
  a well done human interest story published in our regional newspaper, the <i>St. 
  Petersburg Times</i>. In fact, the Largo Community Center was forced by demand 
  to triple the number of course offerings which filled up for the next six months 
  by the end of that January! </p>
<p>Currently, the Largo Community Center is developing a partnership with a local 
  medical facility to create personal home computer applications for physical 
  fitness, dietary, and other wellness management and monitoring issues for use 
  with our patrons. As our elder population has become more confident in their 
  use of new technologies they are helping to define for recreation practitioners 
  those applications best suited to their needs and abilities. The Center is 
  in the process of remodeling space in order to facilitate higher speed Internet 
  connectivity and develop digital photography, voice and digitized music programs 
  and an area for paper craft creations such as birthday cards, flyers, origami, 
  and posters.</p>
<p>Through the use of technology, the relevance of our Community Center programming 
  is being redefined to better suit the needs of today's public recreation patrons.

<p class=MsoBodyText>The City of North Miami Beach, Florida, completed the renovation 
  for youth center in July 1999 with infrastructure for a future computer lab. 
  Monies became available through a grant six months later and, with the assistance 
  of the city's Information Technology Department, 12 computers with web cameras, 
  headphones, and a full array of software were purchased and installed.</p>
<p>The lab is open daily under supervision by a computer teacher. Children do 
  homework, email friends and family, play games, take pictures, make holiday 
  theme cards, and receive one on one instruction. They line up to use the lab 
  and it is rare to see an empty seat. In fact, the children have time limits 
  when others are waiting.</p>
<p>Classes for senior citizens held in the morning have proven to be a popular 
  program, with email to their families being the number one priority interest. 
  These are highly successful programs, especially for those in the area who do 
  not have computers in their home. &#8212; <a href="mailto:harriett.orr@citynmb.fl.us">Harriett

<span class="subhead">Library and Recreation Services in Aurora, Colorado</span>
<p>When the Moorhead Recreation Center in North Aurora, Colorado, held an ice 
  cream social in 1999, participants completed a "60 second survey" identifying 
  what they would like to see in this low-income area of the city. One of the 
  top five items for both youth and adults was "library services." It was the 
  number one priority for youth.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>Based on this assessment, a branch library learning center 
  was created by renovating an old office and an adjacent closet through a Community 
  Development Block grant. Jointly developed with Recreation and Library staff, 
  the center was initially set up with three computers, providing access to the 
  library online system and the Internet, and a small collection of books and 
  tapes, some in Spanish. Patrons can check out books, request materials from 
  other libraries and pick them up at Moorehead, and they can type resumes, search 
  the web, and perform other computer activities. Last year the Colorado Library 
  Association gave the Moorhead Library Learning Center an award for "best outreach 
  to diverse populations." And thanks to a Gates Foundation grant, Moorhead was 
  the recipient of four state of the art replacement computers loaded with educational 
  software for children and adults.</p>
<p>In March of 2001, a small grant from Parks and Recreation for People was obtained 
  to support a volunteer teen library team to staff the center and encourage its 
  use, especially by youth. "LibTeens" (the name chosen by the group) take turns 
  staffing the library learning center every afternoon, check material in and 
  out and help users on the computers.</p>
<p>We have begun having preschool story and craft times at the Recreation Center 
  for parents and toddlers, scheduled immediately after parents drop off older 
  children at the school across the street. Recreation and Library staff work 
  together to set up snacks, crafts, and conduct the story time sessions. Fifteen 
  to twenty people attend them weekly. &#8212; <a href="mailto:knelson@ci.aurora.co.us">Katherine

<span class="subhead">Technology, Recreation and Learning Centers in the City 
  of New York/Parks &amp; Recreation</span>
<p class=MsoBodyText><b><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/parks"><img border=0 width=72 height=72
src="/winter-spring-2002/img/compresource.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026" alt="City of NY Parks and Recreation" align="left"></a></b>In 
  the Computer Resource Centers (CRC) Program, we incorporate technology directly into 
  recreational programming &#8212; mainly sports &#8212; building a strong recreation/education 
  partnership. Our students write stories about their favorite players and conduct 
  research on their favorite sports. Our curriculum introduces children to educational 
  technology resources in a fun and approachable way. </p>
<p>We recently began posting our most successful lesson plans on the CRC 
  electronic curricula section of <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/parks">www.nyc.gov/parks</a>. 
  Hotshot Animation is a storytelling and art project where children create a 
  "digital flip book" by stringing images together in a PowerPoint slide show, 
  an exemplary project because children learn a useful software application while 
  doing a creative activity that they enjoy. In the Partners Project, children 
  team up to represent their partners on posters, using a digital camera and design 
  tools. Displaying students' work and photographs in the classroom is a great 
  way to warm up the room and make newcomers feel welcome in the beginning of 
  any class cycle. (It is also helpful to teachers who have to memorize lots 
  of new names in the beginning of the school year.)</p>
<p>Both activities are popular because of their adaptability to various age groups. 
  Anyone can contribute to a simple slide show, and variations can be developed 
  as appropriate. I have used variations of the partners project with adults. 
  In our desktop publishing classes, adults present images that they have edited 
  next to descriptions of their individual editing processes. This reinforces 
  their skills and makes them feel proud of their new abilities. It is also an 
  easy way for adults to swap editing tricks and share new skills. &#8212; <a href="mailto:Ariel.Berhr@parks.nyc.gov">Ariel

<p>The Mesa Red Mountain Multigenerational Center, or "MG" as nicknamed by local 
  youth, is a multi-use 65,000+ square foot Parks and Recreation facility that 
  includes a gym, climbing wall, fitness center and walking track. Six classrooms 
  are programmed for special interest classes and a large dividable hall is used 
  for ongoing recreation programs as well as rentals and special events. Mesa 
  Senior Services, Inc., operates programs from 8am to 5pm weekdays. The center 
  also houses Sirrine Adult Day Health Care, a vital service for families with 
  frail elderly. </p>
<p>Along with these programs and amenities an additional, distinctive partnership 
  was developed to meet the ever-growing demand for community access to computer 
  technology. Beginning in April 1999, City Parks and Recreation staff and representatives 
  from Mesa Community College at Red Mountain (MCC) began discussing their educational 
  and recreational technology objectives and programming needs and found they 
  were very much in line with each other. MCC wanted to develop courses that would 
  appeal to the community. The classes offered would be developed based on feedback 
  from participants and public surveys. Since the partnership developed towards 
  the end of construction of the center, an existing classroom was retrofitted 
  and has 16 student workstations and an instructor station with projector and 
  screen. </p>
<p>The partnership has been operating for nearly three years with all classes 
  and activities, initially targeted for adults and seniors, filled to capacity. 
  Courses cover introduction to the Internet, basics of common desktop programs, 
  and workshops designed for first time computer users. There are 15 to 20 hours 
  per week of free lab time that are open to the public.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2001 drop-in programs were implemented for kids. An unexpected 
  intergenerational program developed from youth participant interest in digital 
  photography and desktop publishing. Senior participants have been interviewed 
  by youth and highlighted in the multigenerational center newsletter that will 
  be further developed in 2002 along with planning for specialty camps and enhanced 
  intergenerational drop-in programs. Most of the credit for the success of the 
  Red Mountain Multigenerational Center computer lab goes to staff and administrators 
  of Mesa Community College who have made a firm and positive commitment to developing 
  community education and technology access opportunities. &#8212; <a href="mailto:paul_widman@ci.mesa.az.us">Paul

<span class="subhead">The University Park CTC in Portland, Oregon</span>
<p>The University Park Computer Technology Center, located in the largest public 
  housing project in Portland, is a partnership between Portland Parks and Recreation 
  and the Intel Foundation. Our computer classes are available to everyone, regardless 
  of age or skill level. Our curriculum and programs include everything from 
  typing, Internet basics, and using educational games such as math in the real 
  world to video/audio creation, photo design, Lego robotics, computer building, 
  and web design.</p>
<p>We have a crew of youth who have been working on creating videos and music 
  to add to them. We are venturing out with web cams and live broadcasting of 
  events in the local neighborhood. We offer a variety of programs for elementary 
  and middle school students, and a laptop program for youth who are heading off 
  to college that requires them to keep up their grade point average and work 
  with the community center on a regular basis.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>At University Park we are thinking of new services to offer 
  the community, including starting a business where youth can design and offer 
  web hosting to local businesses. We are also looking for more volunteers and 
  mentors so we can accommodate more people. Please visit <a
href="http://www.universitypark.org/">www.universitypark.org</a> to keep updated
