<p>At the heart of any community there exist many small connecting points: a conversation 
  at the bus stop, a nod in the grocery store, a shared smile over youthful antics. 
  Through fostering these seemingly insignificant beginnings communities are made. 
  The Community Technology Center where I work, the Rainier Vista Technology and 
  Job Resource Center, is centrally located in a public housing community. The 
  people using our center vary widely in educational background, areas of interest, 
  and level of support needed in their interactions with technology. Some of 
  them come in groups, most come singly. Some of those who walk through the door 
  for the first time are isolated in their own communities, having lived in the 
  same place for ten years, yet not knowing their neighbors. They never attend 
  community events. Their lives revolve around work and family. Their community 
  lives elsewhere.</p>
<p>When people come in for the first time, they find a welcoming and inclusive 
  atmosphere with artwork, photographs and signs up from different language groups 
  and cultures. When I first put up a world map, no one looked at it until I 
  printed out photographs from the various countries and put them on the map; 
  now that's one of the first places people look.</p>
<p>In the orientation and assessment phase we talk a bit to find out what a person's 
  interests are. I introduce new comers around the room telling people not just 
  their name, but what they are interested in learning. We do this each time 
  they come in for a while: "You remember Ayalew, he was here last week. Would 
  you walk him through opening up the typing program?" A couple of week ago, 
  an older Vietnamese gentleman was having trouble controlling his mouse. An 
  eleven-year-old from Ethiopia working on an adjacent computer piped up. "Oh, 
  I remember how I used to do that! Here let me show you. It's really easy once 
  you understand how." It is from such moments that a community begins to come 
  together.</p>
<p><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/RAllison2.Vietnamese.JPG" width="359" height="184" align="right" alt="Vietnamese Women">I 
  liketo think of it as a subtext for everything that we do, the foundation for 
  continued learning and dispelling the myths about technology, because for me, 
  technology is really about connecting people, connecting people to resources, 
  new ideas, and each other. I believe that through technology we are able to 
  explore the larger concepts of communities that live in a wider arena than may 
  be contained in physical space. </p>
<p>But I also believe that the process must be conscious, not necessarily engineered 
  but fostered. A few ground rules for interaction are helpful. The first rule 
  is that we are a neighborhood place and we greet our neighbors when they come 
  in the center. If I am not in the room when a newer participant comes in, I 
  ask if anyone greeted them. Then I may introduce them around again. A few 
  times like this and people get the idea. The way learners demonstrate competency 
  in a task or technique is to teach that technique to someone else. I try to 
  suggest as much cross-cultural interaction as possible. If a student has a 
  homework question, I may ask if someone in the room has any information about 
  the topic or suggestions about research avenues. Or if a learner has made a 
  break through, I will announce it to the room for others to offer congratulations. 
  Learners take ownership in such an environment. They include others. They 
  learn to work together and share their experiences. And what is community, after 
  all, than sharing our lives?</p>
