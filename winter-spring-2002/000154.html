<div class="category_title">Providing Resources to VISTA</div> <span class="posted">by Matt Crichton</span>




<p><table height=224 width=160 align=left><tr><td><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/CropLookForward.jpg" width="133" height="224" alt="Humble Author" align="left"></td></tr></table>"What's 
  a VISTA Leader?" That's a question I get a lot when people hear what I'm doing 
  now, working in that capacity for <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">the 
  Community Technology Center (CTC) VISTA Project</a>. We are a national program 
  and currently have close to 50 AmeriCorps*VISTA members working in CTCs across 
  the US, helping people in low-income and underserved communities use computers 
  in a wide variety of ways. I work at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, 
  where the project is based. VISTA, as I explain to people who ask, is part of 
  AmeriCorps. <a
href="http://www.americorps.gov/">AmeriCorps</a> is like the Peace Corps, but 
  takes place within the US rather than in other countries, and for a term of 
  one year. VISTA and AmeriCorp members are differentiated by the type of work 
  each does. An AmeriCorps member might be teaching a Microsoft Word class. A 
  VISTA would be the one who writes the curriculum for the same class. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.realchangenews.org/"><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/RCLogo.gif" width="211" height="90" alt="Real Change" border="0" align="right"></a>VISTA 
  Leaders have successfully completed at least one year as a VISTA. This ensures 
  VISTA Leaders have some sense of what their VISTAs are going through. During 
  my first year of service, I worked as the MacWorkshop Coordinator at <i><u><a
href="http://www.realchangenews.org/">Real Change</a></u></i>, a homeless newspaper 
  (in Seattle, WA) that also has a computer lab with six Macintoshes open to the 
  public. There I recruited volunteers to be lab monitors, develop and teach 
  classes and workshops, provide general technical support, and revamp and staff 
  our computer giveaway program. The biggest difference between this year and 
  last year: last year I was so busy working with volunteers I didn't get very 
  much time to be in front of a computer to work on projects. This year I am in 
  front of a computer much of the day &#150; quite a different work dynamic!</p>
<p><table height=248 width=230 align=left><tr><td><a href="http://www.realchangenews.org/"><img src="/winter-spring-2002/img/Dec_15_00_cover.gif" width="202" height="248" border="0" alt="Real Change Cover Page" align="left"></a></td></tr></table></p>
<p>I am the first VISTA Leader for this project so there is a lot of new territory 
  I'm discovering. I've done some work on the project's web site, and I have 
  first contact with all the online VISTA applicants who express an interest in 
  signing up with our program, no small task since we've been told we're the most 
  popular and sought after program in <u><a href="https://recruit.cns.gov/">the 
  entire VISTA recruitment system</a></u>. I am in touch with approximately ten 
  new VISTAs each week.</p>
<p>The main responsibility of a VISTA Leader is to provide resources to VISTAs 
  and act as an advocate for them. My major focus is helping CTC VISTAs present 
  their work and experiences. We are using the web as the medium to present our 
  work because the web is an excellent way to communicate with people who are 
  geographically disperse and it's so integral to everyone's work in the project; 
  we want people to be able to present their work and their programs, and having 
  the experience of developing a web site can give people an important tool.</p>
<p>CTC VISTA technology experience varies widely. Some are already very good 
  web designers and others are learning. VISTAs who have designed their own sites 
  send me Internet links. For those who are learning or want additional tools, 
  I created a site about my own 
  VISTA experience last year. Some VISTAs use this as an idea; some 
  cut and paste their own text and pictures into the design. Some just don't 
  have the time or the desire to learn how to make a web site; they send me some 
  text and pictures and I develop a site displaying their experience. These are 
  all gathered in one place to show the incredible diversity of CTC VISTA work that's being done. </p>
<p>I like to use what I know to help other people. I'm interested in project 
  management and leadership and I like to help people learn about computers. 
  These are some of the reasons I sought out this particular opportunity. I love 
  what I do now, though it is not always easy, but I hope to learn many new things 
  along this journey as a VISTA Leader.</p>
