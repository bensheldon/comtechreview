<p>The community technology <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">CTC VISTA project</a> &mdash; the most popular project in the entire <a href="https://recruit.cns.gov/">AmeriCorps online recruitment system </a> &mdash; will be operating in the 2005-06 program year under <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista%20/projectbasics.htm">new guidelines</a> that invite participation by a wide range of community media and technology organizations involved in providing digital opportunities and resources to those who do not ordinarily have access to them. </p>
<p>Briefly, we are moving towards becoming a more proactive project with the establishment of priority areas. The project will develop resources and curriculum to support, learn from, and teach best practices in these areas: </p>
<ul>
<li> community networking </li>
<li> community organizing and development </li>
<li> technology support to non-profit organizations </li>
<li> digital media support programs for youth </li>
</ul>
<p>While organizational applications are being accepted on a rolling basis, the project will operate largely on a first-come, first-serve basis for all who submit approved plans. Final applications are sent to the appropriate Corporation for National and Community Service state offices on July 11, for the end of August PreService Orientation program start. Participant organizations should plan to have the appropriate staff attend the Supervisors Orientation and Training Program on one of two dates: the preconference June 16 th session in Cleveland prior to the CTCNet annual conference, or the September 12 th session in Boston. </p>
<p><span class="subhead">Overview/Project Priorities</span></p>
<p>Since 2000, the CTC VISTA Project has provided coordination, recruitment, training and support for a yearly cadre of approximately 40 AmeriCorps*VISTAs working in community technology centers (CTCs) and related programs across the country. Organizations interested in becoming involved should meet project priorities and other qualifications and be responsible for covering project fees and other expenses, as described in the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista%20/projectbasics.htm">project basics</a>. </p>
<p>Program changes were initiated at the urging of Corporation for National and Community Service leadership in Washington, DC, which encouraged the Project to become more directive by promoting program and resource development in targeted areas. The Project has thus defined a set of priorities that promote cutting edge work in the field that we believe will enhance the effectiveness of our VISTA members and the organizations they support and increase the impact of their work with underserved communities, thereby strengthening the Project, supporting the movement, and benefiting all parties involved. </p>
<p>Applicant organizations are free to address a variety of organizational and program needs, including the traditional AmeriCorps*VISTA ones involving volunteer program development and management, developing partnerships and program material for outreach and fundraising. The VISTA work plan should contain at least one goal that addresses the project's program priority areas that will have prominent area specialists to provide individual and group support as follows: </p>

<p>&#149;&nbsp; <em>Community networking, including wireless. </em> The recent burst of energy and initiatives around neighborhood and municipal wireless projects, as noted in recent issues of the <em>Community Technology Review </em> and elsewhere, underlines this as one of the most promising areas for community information and communications technology development in the immediate future. Experienced community networking projects as well as organizations new to the arena with promising plans that can use the capacity building resources of an AmeriCorps*VISTA member are encouraged. Special support will be provided by Frank Odasz, <a href="http://lone-eagles.com/">Lone Eagle Consulting</a>, cofounder and board member AFCN, author and online course developer with emphasis on using the Internet to build learning communities. </p>
