<div class="sidebar_right" style="margin-top:0px">Community Networking in the 21st Century: <em>The Tech Bloom – Collaborative and Emergent Technologies</em>
<p>“The <a href="http://www.scn.org/commnet/">Community Networking movement</a> has run parallel to the evolution and growth of the Internet as a way to bring access to, and meaningfully use of, computers and computer networks to underserved populations, mostly in rural and depressed urban areas within the U.S., and in developing nations. The various organizations within the movement have focused on access and training to bridge the &quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide">digital divide</a>&quot; and ensure information equity. One of the leading Community Network Organizations, the <a href="http://afcn.org/">Association for Community Networking</a>, used the <a href="http://www.tcrc.net/conference2005/default.asp">Seventh Annual Community Internet Summit</a> (formerly called the National Community Networking Conference) as a platform new thinking about where the community networking movement should be and should go, via <a href="http://www.openspaceaustin.net/">Open Space Austin</a>, &quot;an intensive two day strategy meeting, designed to spark common alignment, new alliances and individual actions for anyone passionate about community &amp; independent media, community networking, community wireless, community informatics &amp; research or community technology and the relevance of these to community and economic development.” — the beginning of <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002641.html">Jon Lebkowsky's report on the conference</a></p></div>

<p><a href="http://www.openspaceaustin.net/">Open Space Austin</a> certainly reinforced everyone's belief in the value of meeting face-to-face. We had a near perfect mix of attendees — ISP reps, rural community leaders, project directors, consultants for telecommunications and economic development, activists, academics, and many new faces representing expertise in community media, mesh wireless, as well as several of the old guard of community networking. Our only regret is that many good folks were unable to join us in these lean economic times. </p>

<p>This was the first time I've attended a conference that focused 100% on supporting the networking among attendees. Typically, most conferences are competing presentations where most presented information is missed by most attendees, and everyone struggles to network in the halls during the limited time between sessions. </p>
<p>Jon Lebkowsky's conference report noted above does a fine job covering the themes discussed and you might enjoy his <a href="http://weblogsky.com/">blog</a>, too. Michael Maranda and other participants have been posting follow-ups to generate new partners, resources, energy, and fresh ideas. The bottom line is never has there been a greater need for good people to come together to make good things happen. By working together we can build collaborative capacity that benefits everyone involved. </p>
<p>This is the core challenge for <em>all </em> community technology organizations — to come together to walk-the-talk and create an organized, if informal, advocacy consortium to jointly address national and state policy issues as a first priority as well as more efficient sharing of resources and expertise as a second priority. </p>

<p>Among the participants' work and contributions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Richard MacKinnon has sustainable venues with many organizations <a href="http://www.austinwirelesscity.org/">serving 40,000 people with wireless in Austin</a>, a model well worth further exploration—and he's working to create OrgForge.net, a project to support organizations develop into nonprofit 501c3's or the best appropriate format. </li>
  <li>Sascha Meinrath shared his community wireless innovations, which are now key listings with other <a href="http://lone-eagles.com/wireless.htm">wireless resources</a> I've gathered. </li>
  <li>Ana Sisnett impressively represented the <a href="http://austinfree.net/">Austin Free-Net</a> and the diversity issues and opportunities before us. </li>
  <li>Inspiration for future whitepapers articulating how AFCN can work more closely with the <a href="http://www.ruraltelecon.org/">Rural Telecommunications Congress</a>, <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet</a> and many other com-tech orgs can be found in essays by our colleagues in the environmental movement <a href="http://www.movementasnetwork.org/">&quot;Movement as Network&quot;</a> project. </li>
  <li>Texas telecom policy bill 789 threatens to outlaw communities installing wireless for their citizens even when the telcos refuse to deliver service. Kudos to <a href="http://savemuniwireless.org/">SaveMuniwireless.org</a> for carrying the torch of opposition on this goofy legislative pitch which is happening all across the country. </li>
  <li>Will Reed and Jim Forester represented <a href="http://www.techforall.org/">TechnologyforAll</a> and its intriguing social enterprises. </li>
  <li>Peter Miller and Paul Hansen shared the exciting <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/project_basics">new community technology VISTA project directions</a> which will have a community networking project component and other new innovations. </li>
  <li>Fred Johnson has a full-time faculty position with the UMass/Boston <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">Community Media and Technology program</a> working with the VISTA project. </li>
  <li><a href="mailto:tdickens4u@earthlink.ne">Richard Cutler</a> is working with innovative Forum 9000 “smart social networking” software systems. </li>
  <li><a href="mailto:cj@gatesfoundation.org">Christopher Jowaisas</a> represented the library projects of the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, libraries having an unshakeable role to play in community learning programs at all levels. </li>
</ul>
<p>Literally every participant has a passion and story to tell — I've encouraged everyone to share their passions and visions via the AFCN listserv and elsewhere. It was very clear that those who made the extra effort to attend were there &quot;on a mission.&quot; </p>
<p>Spring is the season of renewal and may we all renew our commitments to what we believe we can make happen together! </p>
