<h3 class="title">Using GIS Mapping to Build Community</h3>

<TABLE><IMG alt="" border=0 src="/summer-2003/BP5_3details_ArcView.jpg"></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>“Community mapping is powerful because of its capacity to democratize information—both what is recorded and who has access to it. When presented well, maps have the power to convey complicated information and relationships in a straightforward, accessible manner, enabling non-experts to participate meaningfully in community planning and advocacy.”</I>—PolicyLink</P>
<P>How can a grassroots organization or community project make use of an expensive, technical tool like GIS Mapping for community-based social action campaigns? The first step is to see GIS as more than just a shiny acronym. GIS (Geographic Information System) is a catalyst for planning, implementation, and evaluation of local initiatives. Community planners can identify problem areas, compare densities of specific issues in their city (single parents, juvenile crime, traffic accidents, etc), plan events that are central to their constituents, and share and compare local information from their community to other communities and cities. By bringing GIS into the strategic planning phase of an initiative, stakeholders can better predict the effects and success of their programs. By using GIS as an evaluative tool, planners can demonstrate program results in ways that words alone simply could not reveal.</P>
<P>The next step in demystifying GIS is to separate the technology from the process. The Geographic Information System that enables “community mapping” consists of data, software to analyze the data and produce a visual representation, and the necessary hardware to store the raw data and the resulting presentations of the data analysis. There is a broad range of manifestations these three basic components can take—from paper, markers, and human minds to a high-end mapping utility loaded onto top-of-the-line computers with high-resolution laser printers. Although these two possibilities are extreme ends of the spectrum, the underlying process remains the same: collection and analysis of data for the purpose of creating an image that reveals trends, contrasts, and gaps in resources.</P>
<P>Both <A href="http://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</A> and <A href="http://www.lff.org/">Libraries for the Future</A> (LFF) are involved in community mapping projects using GIS. PolicyLink has recently published a Community Mapping tool as part of a larger resource called the <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><A href="http://www.policylink.org/EquitableDevelopment/">Equitable Development Toolkit</A></I>. The Community Mapping section of this comprehensive toolkit identifies key information needed to assess the considerable public and private forces driving gentrification.</P>
<P>There is a “three-part recipe” for using GIS as a community building tool:</P>
<LI>Community knowledge and participation</LI>
<LI>Data by geography</LI>
<LI>Technology capacity</LI>
<P>The conference session, "Using GIS Mapping to Build Community," explores GIS from a national perspective, followed by a case study of a youth-led community development project, focusing on the potential of GIS in community development and change, the value of collaboration and partnerships, and the public library’s role in the CTC movement.</P>
<P>Libraries for the Future is working with youth in four communities in Arizona to assess the quality and quantity of after-school programs. LFF offers one case study in community mapping from this program called “Communities for Youth,” shares its experience in exposing youth to GIS mapping as a tool for social change, and reviews the curriculum used in the program.</P>

<h3 class="title">Going from Free to Fee-Based Services</h3>

<P>Many organizations that offer free programs are now finding the need to develop fee-based programming. The reasons vary from lack of funding to the maturity of the programs. Here’s how to make this transition:</P>
<P><B>Mission-based Program Planning</B></P>
<P>The ultimate goal is to find a sustainable solution that fits within your mission. You need fee-based programs that will run effectively and will not have to be rebuilt and re-implemented. Following the process outlined below will help to ensure the appropriate steps in this transition.</P>
<P>The first step is to assess your current programs. Look at what your facilities already offer, what skills staff members possess, and what makes the most sense to change. Two key elements to remember in this process are your mission and the audience you serve. It is important to define who is affected by the work of your organization and to determine if they can pay you for your services.</P>
<P>Developing fee-based programs that match your organization’s mission will guide your choices about what projects to undertake. It may be important to “reign in” some of the ideas to make sure what is suggested is practical. It is always better to have two successful programs than to have four done poorly.</P>
<P><B>Buy-in from clients and staff</B></P>
<P>It is essential to get buy-in from both your clients and staff. The best way to do this is by involving them early in the planning process. This small but important step will not only give all parties a feeling of ownership, but will also give you valuable feedback during the early stages of planning.</P>
<P><B>What should it cost?</B></P>
<P>When designing fee-based programs the budget should be driven by the ability of participants to pay and the program cost. You will have to do research to determine the amount that your constituents can realistically pay. It is also beneficial to conduct an analysis of competing services in your area served, to benchmark the current cost of similar services.</P>
<P>Remember that, although you may now be getting money for your services, your program may incur new costs. A possible new direct cost may be promotional materials. An indirect cost may be staff time for processing the fees. With clear planning your organization can anticipate most costs allowing for a realistic budget.</P>
<P>With “revised” programming comes new opportunities for fundraising and partnerships. Your program may be eligible for new funding opportunities. In some states, CTCs may qualify to be an e-partner of the Verizon Foundation. For example, the Fund for the City of New York’s Nonprofit Computer Academy receives an administrative grant and non-profit staff members are allowed to apply for vouchers to cover the cost of their training. In addition, you may be able to partner with another agency to raise funds to offer scholarships or discounted options.</P>
<P><B>Evaluation</B></P>
<P>One of the most common pitfalls is to overlook the importance of evaluation. The ability to evaluate the success of your program is the key to the continuation of services. Thorough evaluation of the impact of your programming allows for improved and possibly additional services. The evaluation process then leads your organization back into the mission-based program planning process.</P>
<P><B>Success in the field</B></P>
<P>There are numerous fee-based services CTCs have developed that have been successful. The programs range from computer training, summer camps to consulting services. Participants have been youth, schools, senior citizens, entire communities, and non-profits. In each case, the CTC started with what it could maintain and grew the programs as capacity allowed.</P>
<P>Mission-based program planning, involvement of clients and staff, and thorough program evaluation are the cornerstones on which you build successful “free to fee” programs. The true power of this model is introduced when your CTC’s creative ideas and energies are built into this framework.</P>

<h3 class="title">LEARN in Connecticut</h3>

<P>In May 2000, LEARN, a regional educational service center in Connecticut, received word that it had been awarded a three-year grant from the U.S. Dept. of Education to create four Community Technology Centers (CTCs). The primary goal of the <A href="http://www.learn.k12.ct.us/">Regional Access for Technology</A> (RAFT) program is to provide computer literacy training to adults, out-of-school technology opportunities for school-age children, early literacy for preschoolers, and professional development for teachers. <TABLE style="WIDTH: 323px; HEIGHT: 279px" cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=323 align=left border=0><TBODY><TR><TD><IMG alt="" src="/summer-2003/LM3_RAFTkidslaptops.jpg" border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><P>Based on a community needs assessment, the CTCs were created with strong community partners and were located in four towns with diverse populations and needs regarding computer literacy. The unique aspect of these centers is their school-based/non-school-based physical locations, which range from a 100-year-old elementary school building to a public library to a child care center. Balancing youth and adult programs and open to everyone, the Regional Access for Technology program offers a range of services from preschool to senior citizens.</P><P>A strong component of the Regional Access for Technology's success has been its strong partnerships. For example, a successful partnership with the Southern Illinois University, which has a branch at the military base located in Groton, CT, was formed early in the start-up phase of creating the CTCs. The university program offers a bachelor's degree program in Workforce Education. CTC managers work with interns to capitalize on their strengths and skills for job responsibilities such as teaching introductory computer classes, helping during walk-in open access times, or acting as teaching assistants. In the past two years, internships have encompassed a total of 1,950 volunteer hours for the program.</P><P>Jeffrey Walsh, a SIU intern, reported at the end of his term: "RAFT provided the best opportunity to enhance my skills as a trainer. RAFT offers services to the elderly, whose number one reason for taking computer classes is to not be left behind. I was able to spend time with individuals and watch their excitement as what they first thought was impossible became possible."</P><P>In September 2001, LEARN forged a new partnership with the Verizon Foundation. The Verizon Foundation advocates building relationships that focus on improving the lives of people through the integration of innovative technology. The Regional Access for Technology's mission integrates this goal and in turn provides the community with technology training. As an ePartner, RAFT utilizes the funding through the Verizon Foundation for eTraining by encouraging non-profit agencies to send their employees to computer training. In addition, the primary partnerships with the Groton Public Library, Stonington and Norwich Public Schools, the Boys &amp; Girls Club, and the Clinton Child Care Service have provided significant in-kind and financial support. Without their commitment our program would not be in existence today.</P><P><P><HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=3></P><P><I>Nancy Cleary (<A href="mailto:NCLEARY@LEARN.K12.CT.US">ncleary@learn.k12.ct.us</A>) Site Manager RAFT, LEARN. Paula Cymbala (<A href="mailto:pcymbala@learn.k12.ct.us">pcymbala@learn.k12.ct.us</A>) is Project Coordinator for RAFT, LEARN.</I></P>

<h3 class="title">ValleyNet in Vermont: A Model Recycling Partnership</h3>

<P><IMG alt="" border=0 src="/summer-2003/backlitman.gif">In 2002, two organizations pulled together to provide their community with a single event for handling all unwanted used computer equipment.<A href="http://www.valley.net/">ValleyNet</A>, a not-for-profit, community network and ISP in Norwich, VT that serves eastern Vermont and western New Hampshire, and <A href="http://www.guvswd.org/">the Greater Upper Valley Solid Waste Management District</A> (GUVSWD) of North Hartland, VT. Once again, in April 2003 these two non-profit organizations got together to host their annual Swap Meet and Recycling Event.</P><P>For several years, ValleyNet had offered an annual sale-and-swap community event where used computer equipment could be bought and sold. At the same time, GUVSWD organized events where old computer equipment could be accepted for recycling. The partnership drew upon the experience and assets of each organization:</P><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type=disc><LI>The Community Network (CN) used free web site advertising to get the word out to community members and to targeted population of computer users.</LI><LI>The CN secured access to a good-size program room (1600 sq. ft.) in a local museum with parking, whereas the GUVSWD has no such facility.</LI><LI>The CN&#8217;s &#8220;techies&#8221; (computer hardware/software experts) determined approximate value of equipment, if any, and whether it had any resale potential.</LI><LI>The Waste District supplied knowledge of the recycling channels available, the level of service provided by each, the costs of each, and whether they were environmentally and socially responsible companies.</LI><LI>The Waste District contracted with the chosen recycler and handled logistics.</LI><LI>Proceeds from the sale of used computers were used to offset the cost of recycling, keeping the recycling fee charged to minimal levels.</LI><LI>The entire event helped the organizations achieve their primary missions.</LI><LI>The easy, full-service event created significant good-will and exposure for both the CN and the Waste District.</LI></UL><P><B>How It Worked</B></P><P>The event was spread over two days. The opportunity for bringing computers in was on a Friday, and the sale of used equipment was on Saturday. Recycling was available both days.</P><P><B>Promotion</B></P><UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type=disc><LI>Close to $2,100 was spent on local newspaper advertising.</LI><LI>Public service announcements were run on local cable access and on local market radio stations (another benefit of having a nonprofit participate).</LI><LI>Free event calendars were contacted for postings.</LI><LI>We wrote a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, and it was published 10 days before the event.</LI><LI>Posters were printed and displayed at local food stores, libraries, and other venues.</LI><LI>Emails were sent to all 7,000 subscribers of ValleyNet reminding them of the event. The first email was sent 14 days before the event and the follow-up was sent three days before the event.</LI><LI>Local ISPs were also contacted, and they promoted the event on their web sites.</LI></UL><P><B>Day One</B></P><P>All day, computers were accepted both for sale and for recycling. Residents and organizations including schools, municipalities, and corporations with equipment to get rid of pulled up to our check-in location. There, our techies determined if the computer was saleable or not. (In Spring 2003, systems had to have a CD-ROM drive and a Pentium running Windows 98 or better. For Macs, we required a PowerPC-level processor to be considered saleable. This relatively high standard was required because even though the community is based in rural New England, there is high computer sophistication among residents.)</P><P>If a computer was deemed appropriate for resale, the owner decided to donate it to the event or to sell it on consignment. (This choice was possible because the CN is a 501(c)3 charitable corporation, and many donors could take advantage of the tax implications.) Selling donated computers increased our cash reserves for subsidizing the recycling, plus additional proceeds were allocated for a scholarship fund. If the computers were sold on a consignment basis, then 75% of the sale price was returned to the original owner.</P><P>The techies helped in determining the selling price but did not assist the donor in determining the value for donations&#8212;in accordance with IRS rules. The equipment was then brought to the community room where the sale was to be held. There, a table was staffed with several people to handle the appropriate paperwork for consignment and donation. Each computer was assigned and labeled with a number, and then each was placed with its general group (PCs in one area, Macs in another, printers another, etc).</P><P><IMG alt="" border=0 src="/summer-2003/recyclingtruck.gif">If the equipment was not saleable, the resident could decide to recycle it for a $10/system fee or to take it back home. Individual peripherals were recycled for a $5 fee. We highly recommend that the recycled equipment gets handled once and is deposited in the truck that will ultimately deliver the equipment to the recycling vendor. This &#8220;triaging&#8221; was done right at the recycling truck so that the recycled units could be placed immediately on the tractor trailer recycling truck.</P><P>At the 2003 recycling event we added a new element&#8212;free cell phone recycling. The public could drop off their unwanted cell phones at no charge. ValleyNet partnered with CollectedGood. CollectedGood is a mobile phone recycling resource that recycles cell phones in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. ValleyNet acted as a repository and will receive a small stipend as a fundraising collection program.</P><P>Also present at the recycling event in 2003 were representatives from WinCycle of Windsor, Vermont. They were able to accept as donations items that didn&#8217;t meet the Swap Meet standards but were still useful and functional. WinCycle is a non-profit organization that donates functional computers and other equipment to individuals in need, educational institutions, and non-profit charitable groups.</P><P>When time for accepting computers for sale was over, the systems were set on tables, organized, and booted up. Some testing was done, and the systems could be functional the next day for show during the sale. It was important in the pre-event publicity to warn donors that their systems should be cleaned of personal files before dropping them off. We also created &#8220;system tags&#8221; that explained the chip speed, hard drive size, and other important facts about the system for the potential buyers.</P><P><B>Day Two</B></P><P>The sale ran from 10 am to 1 pm. An admission fee of $1 was charged for possible buyers. Revenues from sales were carefully tracked. From 1-2 pm, people who had consigned equipment could return to reclaim any unsold pieces. At 2 pm, schools and non-profits who had registered in advance were allowed to scour the leftovers and take any for free on a rotating lottery basis. At 3 pm, clean-up commenced with any remaining equipment taken to the recycling truck or held for a subsequent event.</P><P>Warning: Several people who enjoy tinkering with computers showed up at the recycling trailer in attempts to find parts to scavenge. This created a safety issue with too many people around and climbing on the material, and they could have damaged some valuable equipment. It is recommended that scavengers are turned away and are told to purchase the inexpensive used equipment. This is also good environmental/public policy since those who have paid the recycling fee expect their equipment to be properly disposed.</P><P><B>Follow-up</B></P><P>Checks were prepared and sent to people who had consignment sales. Revenues included those monies, gate receipts from the event, sale from donations, and recycling revenue. After advertising and other expenses, there was still money left over for a $1,000 donation to a local scholarship fund.</P><P>The event required participation of about 30 staff members and volunteers, including a troop of Boy Scouts that did a lot of the heavy lifting for the recycling. Personalized thank-you notes were also sent to all donors, volunteers, and consignment sale participants.</P><P><B>Collection Numbers</B></P><P>The local community served represents about 30,000 households. About 250 residents and 20 organizations brought in equipment for recycling for a total of 28,500 pounds&#8212;over 14 tons! This amount of material filled a 53-foot tractor trailer. The recycler charged $0.18/ pound, plus trucking back to Massachusetts, for a total of $5,938.</P><P><B>Resale</B></P><P>About 75 computers were in the sale, as well as many peripherals including printers, modems, scanners, monitors, and FAX machines. The average price of Mac systems with basic color monitor, CD, modem, mouse and keyboard was $50. The average price for an early Pentium machine with 15&#8221; color monitor, CD-ROM, keyboard, mouse, modem, and printer was $125.</P><P>Keeping prices this low helped individuals and families that could not afford new computers have a computer. We did limit computer sales to a maximum of three systems to prevent dealers from taking advantage of the low prices. We also have considered &#8220;needs testing&#8221; for potential buyers, but have not come up with a suitable strategy.</P><P><B>Additional Notes</B></P><P>We did not accept any impact printers for sale. We require that they be recycled since there is no acceptable local market for them. We also turned over every IBM XT, AT, 386, 486, Win95, and their associated peripherals to the recycler. Many Win95 machines will be resold in other markets.</P><P>Resale prices are quite low. It is very difficult for many consumers who spent $2,500 five years ago for a computer to see it sold for just over $100. However, market conditions demand that pricing structure especially if the goal is to move the equipment in the least possible time frame.</P><P>Used color printers are difficult to sell without the driver software or functional ink cartridges. They do sell, but at the $25 price point.</P><P>Selling used software has also been a problem. Remember, our goal is to have the room totally cleaned out by 5 pm. In past years, we have been swamped with used software that eventually ended up in the landfill. We are still searching for an adequate solution for reselling this resource.</P><P>Privacy is a growing concern. Many donors wanted to drop off the equipment with the casual remark &#8220;Please wipe the hard drive.&#8221; This was not only physically impossible for us to do in the short time frame, but we have found that used computers need a working operating system for them to sell. We continually urge donors to perform their own file removal and keep some basic software on the machine such as word processing software or games.</P><P align=center><IMG alt="" border=0 src="/summer-2003/line.gif" style="HEIGHT: 151px; WIDTH: 251px"></P><P><B>Summary</B></P><P>The ValleyNet/GUVWSD Computer Sale and Recycling Event was a huge success that built on earlier efforts over the past 5 years. It takes meticulous planning and a lot of hard work from many individuals; however, the results are measurable and dramatic. Functional computer equipment ends up in the hands of needy families at below market prices, individuals with higher incomes get a tax deduction for donating equipment, and broken equipment was properly recycled according to the best known practices. Proceeds were donated to a local scholarship fund and local nonprofits and schools receive functional computers at no cost. We are already getting calls from donors of when we are having the next event.</P><HR align=center SIZE=3 width="100%"><I>Ronald Boehm (<A href="mailto:valleynet.admin@valley.net" target=_top>valleynet.admin@valley.net</A>) is the Executive Director of ValleyNet, Inc., and John Fay (<A href="mailto:guvswd@valley.net">guvswd@valley.net</A>) is the Program Director for the Greater Upper Valley Solid Waste District.</I>

<P>Less than six weeks ago, we gathered to meet with then-new CTCNet Executive Director Kavita Singh to discuss all the programs, projects, and complementary efforts being undertaken by CTCNet and the Community Media and Technology program at the College of Public and Community Service at UMass/Boston. High up on Kavita's list was the idea that we could produce a special issue of the <I>Community Technology Review</I>, designed to complement and add to all the activities that would be taking place around the annual CTCNet conference in June. This issue is the result of that discussion. As editors, we couldn't be more delighted. And we hope that you share our sense of accomplishment.</P>
<P>As editors, we can take very little credit for what is worthy here. Our delight and pride is in seeing how others have risen to the occasion. The bulk of this effort really rests with two people&#8212;Daniel Schackman at CTCNet and Melissa Daigle at the College. Both are CTC VISTAs and have been working very hard on their respective projects since their start dates last summer, making substantial contributions to the overall project by their work, their example, and their efforts to involve others.</P>
<P>For his part, on this particular project, Dan has shepherded a great deal of the content, the writing, and the organization; Melissa has worked in all these areas and has overseen most of the production work, too, for both the online and hard copy versions. Together they have achieved for the conference what the <I>Review</I> tries to do for the movement more generally&#8212;they have given it a depth and thoughtfulness that is not ordinarily associated with the busy-ness that overwhelms almost every active practitioner and activist in the community media and technology field and that all too often extends to conference workshops themselves. With articles, interviews, and resource pointers divided into sections that correspond to the conference tracks and workshops, this special issue of the <I>Review</I>, integrated with post-conference workshop links, provides a living testimony to the thoughtfulness that informs our work and guides us in developing effective practices and programs at their best and to leading a life fully rich in thought and action to challenge us in the highest way possible. We are both humble and proud in having the opportunity to offer these things to you.
<P>As the Editors' Introduction notes, this special <EM>Community Technology Review</EM> is designed to complement and add to all the activities surrounding the CTCNet Conference. The five sections in this issue correspond with the five tracks:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/CTRConf03Track4.htm">The Big Picture</A></LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/CTRConf03Track2.htm">Policy, Advocacy, and Organizing</A></LI>

<LI><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/CTRConf03Track5.htm">Technology</A></LI></UL>
<P>The Association for Community Networking is also presenting <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/CTRConf03AFCNTrack.htm">AFCN track sessions</A> as part of this year's conference. </P>
<P>The articles in these tracks were selected to enhance the tracks overall, as well as address some of the topics that will be presented in particular workshops. The contents and section headers are being linked to the sessions which will all have presentation and follow-up materials, as best as they can be organized. We welcome your comments on what we believe is a unique and dynamic conference-publication combination.&#8212;<EM>the editors</EM></P>

<h3 class="title">Local Support, National Implications</h3>

If we had a crystal ball that provided a glimpse into the future, it might show us a world where all people had access to some form of technology. But, even though we know crystal balls are not real, we can do something to equalize everyone's access to technology and to the flow of information. 
<P>More than two years ago, HP Chairman and CEO Carly Fiorina's proclaimation that HP would be a company committed to global citizenship prompted the creation of an e-inclusion vision for HP. This vision was based on the premise that technology, in conjunction with communities, could help people learn, work, and thrive.</P>
<P>The e-inclusion mission is to provide people access to greater social and economic opportunities by closing the gap between technology-empowered and technology-excluded communities, focusing on sustainability for the communities and HP. To fulfill this mission, HP has developed a number of philanthropic initiatives and forged public/private partnerships to help underserved communities fulfill their aspirations for participation in the digital age. Many of those investments have been in community technology centers.</P>
<P>Janiece Evans-Page, Director of e-inclusion and Global Solutions for HP Philanthropy and Education, noted, "CTCs are increasingly demonstrating that they are important assets in building a community's human, social, and economic capital. We've been able to leverage these rising community assets with HP's technology expertise to create positive change in many underserved communities across the U.S."</P>
<P>An example of one initiative is the HP Community Technology Centers Grant that awarded HP technology to twenty-six non-profit organizations and educational institutions for community centers targeting adults and youth in underserved communities. The awards include computer equipment and in-kind volunteer components provided by local HP employees.</P>

<TR>
<TD>Bess Stephens</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>"The CTC Grant represents a key strategy for HP Philanthropy," said Bess Stephens, Vice President of HP Philanthropy and Education. "This approach brings the best of HP&#151;HP technology and talent&#151;to communities that need it the most." By selecting organizations in underserved communities, the initiative contributes to HP's e-inclusion mission.</P>
<P>Another example is the HP and Magic Johnson Foundation (MJF) partnership. Over the past three years, HP and MJF have established 11 Magic Johnson HP Inventor centers in inner-city communities including Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Atlanta, Harlem, Chicago, Lansing, and Houston. Over the next 18 months, an additional 11 centers will be established. This partnership has enabled underserved communities to harness the benefits of the digital economy and empower youth, adults, and seniors to a new world through job skills training, computer literacy, financial and credit education, and health education. HP and MJF are developing a model that will enable future doctors, lawyers, teachers, technicians, and professionals to emerge from these centers.</P>
<P>The company's e-inclusion efforts are all about collaborating with partners and communities to create sustainable solutions that are culturally relevant and increase access to information, create new opportunities, and empower the citizens of these communities to enhance their lives.</P>
<P>HP may not have a crystal ball, but it is cognizant that a vision of technology access for all can be achieved through a collective community partnership. It is through cooperative efforts and collaboration that this vision will be shaped and realized.</P>

<h3 class="title">CTCNet: Our Journey</h3>

<P>CTCNet has had a fantastic journey over the past years, starting as a small coalition of six technology access programs on the East Coast and developing into a national network of more than <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/membership/directory/index.htm">1200 community technology centers</A>. Throughout this period of growth, we have remained committed to our mission to support community technology centers so that they can better serve their constituencies: low-income communities where people gain access to computers and computer-related technology.</P>
<P>The organization was founded in 1990—as the Playing To Win Network—by the late Antonia "Toni" Stone, a former math teacher who during the early 1980s had started a computer technology center in the basement of a housing development in Harlem. In the early 1990s, Ms. Stone cooperated with <A href="http://main.edc.org/">EDC</A> in an application to the <A href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</A> (NSF), which resulted in a five-year ($2 million) grant to support the extension of the network's services, the expansion of its membership, and its evolution into an independent, self-governing non-profit organization. The grant also supported sustained, professional evaluation of the Network and its affiliates. At the start of the grant the organization's name was changed to the Community Technology Centers' Network (CTCNet). Consistent with its NSF grant goals, CTCNet has now incorporated in Massachusetts as a non-profit, tax-exempt organization with a board of directors representing its affiliate organizations.</P>
<P>While at EDC and supported by the NSF grant, CTCNet and EDC staff produced several widely-used publications, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI><I><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/toc.htm">The Center Start-Up Manual</A></I> </LI>
<LI><I><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/evalkit.doc">The CTCNet Evaluation Toolkit</A></I> </LI>

<LI><I><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/reports/eval.htm">Community Technology Centers: Impact on Individual Participants and Their Communities</EM></A></I><EM> </EM></LI></UL>
<P>These publications have all been made freely available via the web and can be found at the <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/publications.htm">CTCNet Publications</A> web site. 
<P></P>
<P>For its blend of Internet-based activities, including web site and regional, national, and topical discussion lists, CTCNet was named the 1998 winner in the Public Access category of the <A href="http://www.giic.org>Global Information Infrastructure (GII) Awards</A>. In 1999, CTCNet received a Pioneers of Public-Private Technology Partnerships Award " <A the in partner a became CTCNet 2000, In Caucus.

Also at this time, the network was joined by 515 former PowerUP Centers.</P>
<P>Now, we are poised for growth in exciting new areas, from community development to regional organizing to international connections.</P>
<P>To the future, and beyond!</P></LI>

<h3 class="title">The CTCNet Conferences: A Look Back</h3>

<P>CTCNet’s 2003 Conference in Washington, DC, “Creating Our Future: Shaping the Agenda of Community Technology,” is the twelfth annual affiliates’ get-together. Looking back at the conferences, we can trace the upward trajectory of the organization starting with small meetings of the first Playing To Win Network affiliates to broader-based gatherings over the past few years. The new millennium has seen us really take off. In 2000, the affiliates advanced on Atlanta for Digital Bridges: Under Construction. In 2001, CTCNet surfed into San Diego for Advancing Community Technology: The Next Wave. 2002 brought the members two-stepping down to Austin for Access and Beyond: Advancing a Community Technology Agenda.</P>
<P>We asked some of our colleagues for their memories of conferences past:</P>
<P>“I recall attending the 1995 CTCNet conference at the Capital Children's Museum in Washington, DC and meeting dozens of very wonderful people. Attendance at this conference was small, but it was exciting all the same. This was my first interaction with technology access activists from other cities. I see some of those same faces at current CTCNet conferences, and they seem like family to me. I love meeting new people at CTCNet conferences, but the old-timers have a special place in my heart. They're like childhood friends. We've been through so much together. To have seen CTCNet grow to its current size and stature has been amazing. And the journey has just yet begun.”—<EM>Phil Shapiro, Educator</EM></P>
<P>”The Conference I have the most vivid memories of was the Pittsburgh Conference in 1997. The organization (now CTCNet) had grown. What was so great about that conference was that the energy of a growing grassroots organization was clearly evident. It was the last time CTCNet would have (at least for me) that feeling of being a very young baby almost able to walk, but not quite there yet. All wondrous and a bit unsettling at the same time. Contrast this with the Conference in Chicago, which was our first venture into the realm of upscale hotel venues. If Pittsburgh was CTCNet as a toddler, Chicago was our high school prom. We weren't accustomed to our new growth and the fancy duds, but we pulled it off. And Austin? It was so clear we had almost arrived. We were adults in the first real job with real responsibilities and a new family to take care of. The masses of people, the growing movement, and others were starting to look to us for guidance and support.”—<EM>Felicia Sullivan, Director, Lowell Community Technology Consortium</EM></P>
<P>“I think the most significant year for conference growth was 1999 (Chicago), when the conference was moved from the college campus environment to a spacious hotel. The number of sessions and quality of presentations increased. By 2000 (Atlanta), presentations were made available online. I find the online materials from conferences to be VERY useful resources.”—<EM>Judy Hallman, Executive Director, RTPNet</EM></P>
<P>“It was exciting and moving for me to observe the diversity present [at the] CTCNet conference in Atlanta. The racial and ethnic variety was impressive, and made a visible and dramatic statement about what is happening in CTCs around the country today. Just as exciting was the age diversity (at least one really cute baby was in attendance, and I know that Toni Stone was about to enter her eighth decade) and the "lifestyle" diversity. One friend commented that there were a surprising number of women in shoulder pads carrying big fat planners. (I was one of them, almost—this year I traded in my fat planner for a Palm Pilot that weighs about four ounces, which is a big win for the frequent traveler.) There were also representatives from city government, labor unions, religious organizations, corporations, and—of course—the Birkenstock crowd. I loved it. There aren't many opportunities for such a diverse group to come together in our society around something as positive as community technology centers. I am grateful to be part of what we are building.”—<EM>Laura Breeden, Director, America Connects Consortium</EM></P>
<P>“At the 2002 CTCNet Conference, I was particularly amazed by the amount of local regional organizing occurring across the country. Folks were sharing information on why they had organized, what they planned to do with their coalitions and discussed the possibility of forming formal CTCNet chapters. To me, this is the beauty of CTCNet conferences. Regional organizing was not established as a priority for the 2002 CTCNet Conference but when we bring together grass roots CTCs, they define their own agenda, and end up sharing the information that is important to them, and at the same time, inform the CTCNet staff and board of the issues they are facing. And the best evidence of how the CTCNet Conferences have improved over the years is the quality of the snacks. At the 2002 CTCNet Conference we were treated to ice cream bars and warm pretzels. The attendees talked about it for days and even mentioned it on their evaluation forms. The importance of yummy snacks should not be underrated!”—<EM>Angela Stuber, Executive Director, Ohio Community Computing Center Network (OCCCN)</EM></P>
<P>“I think the CTCNet national conference has evolved over the last five years into a wonderful community technology experience. In my opinion, there is not a venue like our conference that promotes genuine diversity in attendees and programs for our community initiative.”—<EM>Erroll Reese, President, CTCNet</EM></P>
<P>This year, with over 1200 affiliate members, we are sure this gathering will be a source of community building, idea sharing, and organizing for our movement. We are all looking forward to this year’s conference being the best ever, and each year’s surpassing the last!<BR></P>

<P align=center><EM>Richard Lowenberg</EM></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>The <A href="http://www.afcn.org/">Association for Community Networking</A> is an educational non-profit corporation dedicated to fostering and supporting "Community Networking"--community-based creation and provision of appropriate technology services. AFCN's mission is to improve the visibility, viability, and vitality of Community Networking by assisting and connecting people and organizations, building public awareness, identifying best practices, encouraging research, influencing policy, and developing products and services.</P>
<P>At the CTCNet Conference in Washington, DC, the AFCN Open Source Initiative and Awards will be announced. The initiative, which is promoting the creation of Open Source community networking software tools and application, is putting out a call for submissions, and will offer a financial award for best solutions.</P>
<P>Also, the organization's leadership will take the opportunity to discuss new strategies and future initiatives for the organization itself, with the input of all conference attendees who want to join in. Though initiated by early exemplars in the late 1970s and through the BBS days of the 1980s, the current version of Community Networking organizations and activities has been relatively the same for the past ten years, since around the time that the Internet went public. The times, they are a-changin'. It is time to rethink the context, needs, goals and actions that surround local community development in the "information society" to continue to give greatest relevance and effectiveness to the next generation of Community Networking initiatives. </P>
<P>AFCN is currently encouraging individuals to be candidates for Board and Officer positions. The organization needs smart, creative and influential new leadership. It's time for some of the dedicated "old guard" to rotate out of office, and for new humane energies. If you are technically skilled, or a builder of social networks, or an economic mover and shaker and are already too busy, you're the person we want. Give it some thought, then <A href="mailto:rl@dcn.org"></A>.</P>
<P>The <A href="http://www.afcn.org/">AFCN web site</A> offers information about the organization and about the many community networks that have spurred a movement, a wealth of online resources, research, lessons learned, personal contacts, and active links to site-specific experiences; and next steps to take in order to grow a community networking project where you live.</P>

<h3 class="title">Steve Wright: Community Technology Is Rarely about the Technology</h3>

<img alt="Steve Wright" border=0 src="/summer-2003/img/BP7_wright.jpg"><p>Steve Wright (<a href="mailto:swright@salesforce.com">swright@salesforce.com</a>) was a high school teacher and administrator for ten years, and has been at salesforce.com/foundation as the Program and Technical Director for a little over two years. &#8220;And I did a couple other things in between,&#8221; he says.</i></p>
<p>
<hr align=center SIZE=2 width="100%">
<b>Current Work</b> 
<p>My work with salesforce.com/foundation centers on community media. As I see it, there are two trends that make this work particularly important and immediate. First, the conglomeration of American media in the hands of a very few corporations has substantively locked individuals and communities out. The information that we get through the major corporate channels is run through an economic filter. Human stories and diverse opinions do not get heard. The second trend is the growth of technology and technology users to the point where it is now possible to produce quality media within a community for a local or a broader audience.</p>

<p>Specifically, salesforce.com/foundation has provided small community media grants to youth and community development organizations and then followed those grants with training and in person assistance to create quality, relevant media. To date, most of the work that has been produced falls in the youth media category. But, this is the easy part. The real goal of this work is to find audiences for the media. To do this we have built a web portal (<a href="http://www.youthspace.net/">www.youthspace.net</a>) where much of this media is being streamed. It is our intention for this portal to become increasingly dynamic where content can be self-published and commented on by a broad audience.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are working with a group of community organizations in San Francisco to encourage our municipal leaders to hold Comcast accountable to the residents of San Francisco. This work has taken the form of community information meetings, testimony before the board of supervisors and convening of community media organizations to plan festivals and to trade resources.</p>
<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<p><em>Political will:<br></em>Community Media is inherently political, and I am not necessarily referring to the content. The process by which an individual can be heard is a political process. To create a truly vibrant community media environment, the municipality must be involved and active in advocating this idea to the city&#8217;s cable provider. Many city leaders need to be educated about the benefit of taking this position. In many communities, cable companies are the sole or primary providers of television AND broadband. Broadband connectivity over cable is regulated in a way that gives cable companies a lot of latitude to filter or &#8220;favor&#8221; content. It is important that the community interests are reflected in the cable company&#8217;s decisions. Additionally, funders must have the vision to support community media projects even if the content is not supportive of their worldview. Democracy and free speech are perilously intertwined.</p>
<p><em>CTC role in Community Development:<br></em>While this is a challenge, it is also the most exciting part about our field right now. CTCs are growing from their foundation as public access facilities into two additional tracks that I can see: 1) technology assistance providers to other non-profits and 2) social change organizations that effectively use technology. (This is also demonstrated in the CTCs as <a href="http://www.bctpartners.com/resources/CTCs_as_Catalysts.pdf">Catalysts for Community Change</a> study done for the Ford Foundation.) Because of this development, CTCs are now finding themselves convening neighborhood residents with other public and private agencies for purposes like creating community media or other civic engagement reasons. While this is a logical extension of a CTC&#8217;s technological expertise and community trust, it is a new role for many organizations.</p>

<p>I think both of these challenges can be summed up in the idea that community technology is very rarely about the technology.</p>
<p><b>The Rewards</b></p>
<p>The opportunity to work directly with a broad range of people to help facilitate their vision for their communities is extremely rewarding.</p>
<p><b>Some Words of Advice</b></p>
<p>I guess I have different advice depending on who is asking. For intermediaries or funders, the most valuable lesson I have learned is to get out of the way. The mistakes that I have made have been around pushing too hard on my agenda and not listening well enough to the people who provide the direct services to the community. Due diligence is critical, but once you have found an organization that you trust and you believe to be effective, let them do the work.</p>
<p>For Community Technology or Community Development folks, my advice is to seek out partners that that have complimentary competencies. The technological expertise that exists in CTCs is, in my opinion, under-utilized by other social change organizations. In a world where technology is more prevalent and more powerful, CTCs can position themselves to provide a whole new level of access&#8212;access to the ability to publish, the ability to be heard. This is also a very interesting social entrepreneurship opportunity. CTCs can provide training, web hosting, technical assistance, even connectivity to other community non-profits. If not for income, these services can be provided as a way to offset the costs of broadband (T1) connectivity, high-end technology or professional development.</p>
<p><b>Looking Ahead</b></p>
<p>What the future holds is more of the same. The ability to create media will continue to be easier and the corporate media outlets will continue to work to have their content seen above all other. I see a movement within the CTC community to provide access to the ability to publish, via cable TV and the Internet. This will be achieved through civic partnership with community and city leaders, with public access cable providers and with other social change non-profits who need increased exposure.</p>

<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><IMG alt="" border=0 src="/summer-2003/BP6_map.jpg"></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Community technology centers are everywhere, or so it seems. But, sometimes our efforts to find each other, to interact, and to collaborate seem a bit haphazard. That&#8217;s why we created the <A href="http://www.c-can.org/search.asp">CTC Map and Database</A>.</P>
<P>When I began working on the Community Computer Access Network (C-CAN) project nearly two years ago, I could confidently name only a handful of CTCs in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Part of my responsibilities as an AmeriCorps*VISTA for C-CAN was to track these centers and find new ones. I am happy to report that there are now about 70 CTCs in our database.</P>
<P>The CTC Database and Map was the idea that started C-CAN and has been the foundation for all other C-CAN initiatives. When we hold networking meetings and conferences it is to place a person with the dots on the map. When we recruit and match volunteers, it is to bring volunteers to the dots that need them. When we have meetings at City Hall with the mayor and his staff, it is to advocate for all of the dots on the map. It's all about the dots.</P>
<P>C-CAN will continue to connect the dots. Resources have been secured to complete the data collection and CTC Map and Database for 2003, and to publish it in a printed directory. At this time, we are looking for donations of printing costs&#8212;if you have any good leads, <A href="mailto:jeff@c-can.org">contact us</A>!</P>

<P align=left>John Zoltner with Jane Oates, Senior Educational Advisor to Senator Ted Kennedy</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>In the last few years, CTCNet and many of our partner organizations have recognized that providing knowledge, support, and technical assistance to community technology centers (CTCs) is not enough to achieve our objective of a digitally-empowered society—without sustained governmental support, our objective will be difficult to reach. That support does not necessarily have to come in the form of new dollars—there are many ways federal, state, and local governments can support community technology without digging into their pockets—but our movement needs government cooperation. Through all of our policy activities, CTCNet reinforces the following beliefs:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Digital Divide has not been solved—in fact serious inequities of access and the ability to use technology and the Internet within the US population still exist. In order to ensure an educated and informed society in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century, it is important to provide a network of public access and training points from a variety of sources, including CTCs, schools, libraries, non-profit organizations, government offices, and private and public homes.</LI>
<LI>The United States cannot achieve equitable access among all Americans and adequate literacy for the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century if all levels of government are not focused on these goals. We advocate for local, state, and federal governments to provide leadership in the effort to connect those populations who have not yet achieved access to technology and the competency to use it.</LI>
<LI>Because CTCs represent an extraordinary array of diverse communities, they serve as laboratories for developing innovative technologies, culturally appropriate content, original ways of applying technologies, and effective training strategies that benefit all segments of society, especially those that traditionally have not had access to computers, the Internet, or the skills to use them.</LI>
<LI>Providing community access to technology is not just an option for schools, libraries, and non-profit organizations. It is a crucial element of fulfilling their goal to inform, educate, and serve the public in an equitable way. CTCs serve as a valuable partner to ensure that these organizations gain the capacity to provide access to technology that benefits the community.</LI>
<LI>Because they often have the deepest reach and greatest effect in underserved communities, small faith- and community-based organizations are strong partners in the effort to eliminate the Digital Divide. As technology becomes increasingly important to their operations, however, they are caught in an <I>organizational</I> Digital Divide. We must ensure they have sufficient access to technology and the capacity to use it effectively, so they can maximize their impact in their communities.</LI>
<LI>"E-Government" strategies should make government information and services available to the public through the Internet and other technologies. Not doing so lowers the quality of service, but doing so risks excluding residents without access to these technologies or the skills to use them confidently. Use of technology in government services must promote equal access to government and equal participation for all members of the public. The introduction of or changes in the use of technology by government must not reduce access or participation by the community and, whenever possible, should advance community access and participation.</LI>
<LI>Because they provide the training and access necessary for residents to use government services online, CTCs are vital avenues to civic participation in e-Government services. E-Government projects should actively include CTCs in their planning efforts and take advantage of the reach of CTCs into the community to ensure that e-Government programs increase democratic participation in the government rather than limit it to those with access who are already skilled in the use of technology.</LI></UL>
<P>Specific advocacy actions that CTCNet has participated in this past year include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>CTCNet was a founding partner of the Digital Empowerment Campaign, which brought together technology advocacy and civil rights organizations to advocate for sustained federal funding of the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) and the U.S. Department of Education's CTC initiative. It was this fight—which WE WON—that first activated CTCNet and our membership around policy issues.</LI>
<LI>CTCNet is working with <A href="article.php?article_id=16">Rep. Nydia Velázquez's</A>(D-NY) and Rep. John Larson's (D-CT) offices to provide background information for and help circulate a sign on letter asking Congress to raise TOP and CTC funding to their FY 2001 levels: $45 million and $65 million respectively.</LI>
<LI>Through reports and other publications written by CTCNet or our partners and members, such as <I><A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/reports/frompolicytoaction_v1.pdf">From Policy to Action: Profiles of Washington Area Programs Making Progress on the Digital Divide</A></I> a report prepared for the Washington, DC Metropolitan Council of Governments, we continue to educate the public, government, and private sector about the extent and character of the Digital Divide in the United States and the community technology programs designed to eliminate it.</LI>
<LI>Partner organizations, CTCNet chapters, and regional consortia of CTCs are coming together to educate legislators and directly advocate for support and funding for community technology centers. These efforts have been led by the efforts of the California Community Technology Policy Group, an outgrowth of the Computers In Our Future Initiative, which held its second annual community technology policy advocacy day in Sacramento on April 25<SUP>th</SUP>. "<A href="article.php?article_id=18">Sacramento Day</A>" brought 140 CTC advocates to the state capital to meet with close to 100 legislative offices. <A href="article.php?article_id=17">CTCNet-Chicago</A> hosted a similar event on May 14<SUP>th</SUP>. CTCNet affiliates in New York recently contacted CTCNet to organize a similar event. Though these efforts have been led by state and regional organizers, CTCNet hopes to take these local models and help to spread them to other areas by collecting and sharing information on events and education materials.</LI>
<LI>CTCNet is organizing a similar national event in Washington, DC on June 26, 2003—the Pre-Conference activity day. During the event we will educate attendees from CTCs on why they should be involved in advocacy, train them on how to be effective advocates, and visit Capitol Hill and federal offices in order to make scheduled visits with legislators, regulators, and their staffs.</LI>

<h3 class="title">Rep. Nydia Vel&#225;zquez--Congressional Support for Community Technology</h3>

<TABLE style="WIDTH: 256px; HEIGHT: 314px" cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=256 align=left border=1><TBODY><TR><TD><IMG alt="" src="/summer-2003/PAT3_NV_Official_03.jpg" border=0></TD></TR><TR><TD><P align=center>Rep. Nydia Vel&#225;zquez</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><IMG height=0 alt="" src="/summer-2003/PAT3_NV_Official_03.jpg" width=0 align=left border=0>Though gaining support for community technology amid steep budget cuts in the current Congress has been a challenge, CTCNet has found champions in Rep. Nydia Vel&#225;zquez (D-NY) and Rep. John B. Larson (D-CT), among others. Rep. Vel&#225;zquez and Rep. Larson coordinated sign-on letters this May to the Appropriations Committees of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary in support of increased funding for the Community Technology Centers (CTC) initiative and the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP), both of which are once again slated for elimination in the Administration's FY 2004 proposed budget. These letters have been signed by 48 Congressional Democrats.</P><P>We recently spoke with Rep. Vel&#225;zquez to learn more about this exciting initiative.</P><P><B>CTR:</B> Why did you draft these letters?<BR><B>Rep. Vel&#225;zquez:</B>Even though technology literacy has become a basic life skill that is vital to educational, economic, social, and civic achievement, the Bush administration is seeking to eliminate federal programs, like TOP and CTC, which aim to build these skills, especially in underserved populations. I didn't want this to happen, so I drafted these letters to ensure that funding for TOP and CTC is restored.</P><P><B>CTR:</B> Why invest in TOP and CTC during a tight budget year?<BR><B>Rep. Vel&#225;zquez:</B>Now is exactly the time we should be investing in these programs. Both programs require such a small investment up-front, and they yield a big return in the future. TOP and CTC are critical to community development and are an important contributing factor to our nation's economic prosperity. But these programs, along with others focusing on health care, housing, education, and small business, are being cut in favor of tax cuts for big business and the wealthiest Americans.</P><P><B>CTR:</B> What was the reaction of colleagues when asked for signatures?<BR><B>Rep. Vel&#225;zquez: </B>Given that these programs serve people in communities across the nation, there was widespread support among my colleagues for this letter. Members of Congress who signed our letter represent both rural and urban districts and serve a diverse constituency, including seniors and minorities. We succeeded in getting TOP and CTC funded last year, despite the fact that the President tried to eliminate them, and we are confident that we will succeed again this year.</P><BR></font>

<h3 class="title">Regional Policy Action: CTCNet Chicago/Illinois Tech Day</h3>

<IMG alt="" src="/summer-2003/PAT4_IL_group_picture.jpg" border=0>In the wee hours of the morning of May 14, 2003, a group of CTCNet Chicago service providers and program participants boarded a coach bus headed for the Illinois State Capitol. Springfield bound, our mission was to educate state legislators on the importance of the work of CTCs in their communities and to highlight the impact on community residents. We were all on our way to participate in what has become known as Illinois Community Technology Day (Tech Day).</P><P>Tech Day grew out of an effort that began two years ago as an advocacy strategy for CTCNet Chicago to inform legislators of the work of community technology centers and to help influence legislation and direct resources for community technology centers in Chicago area communities.</P><P>As with most collaborative activities, Tech Day required intensive activity coordination among participating affiliates, which meant it was a "roll up our sleeves" production. In addition to CTCNet Chicago affiliates, our partners for the event included the Illinois Community Technology Consortium, Prairienet in Champaign and East St. Louis, Lincoln Land Community College in Springfield, Northern Illinois Center for Adaptive Technology in Rockford, and Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.</P><P>We developed an informational package to leave with legislators that included information about CTCNet Chicago, talking points, our legislative agenda, and a DVD produced by IIT Digital Media Center that highlighted the work of various CTCNet Chicago affiliates. Team leaders were recruited from among our members. Their duty was to recruit Tech Day participants, set appointments with key legislators, and serve as a point person for their group of participants. Team leaders also participated in a special training on "how to talk to legislators" to prepare them for the day's activities. As a result, we more than tripled our previous years' number of tech day participants.</P><P>CTCNet Chicago members arrived in Springfield around 10 am, where we were joined by other Illinois CTCNet affiliates. This year's Tech Day began with a Community Technology Centers' Forum designed to introduce attendees to Illinois CTCs and to highlight the work we do. Legislators and state agency representatives were invited to attend. Two key members of the state's Computer Technology Committee, Reps. Constance Howard and Ruth Munson, were in attendance. Rep. Howard provided us with an official welcome and thanked us for our work on Illinois technology issues.</P><P>In addition to chairing the Computer Technology Committee, Rep. Howard also serves on the state's Digital Divide Elimination Advisory Committee. She extended an invitation for our group to join her in the house gallery after the forum, so that she could introduce us to her fellow representatives, since they were in session that afternoon.</P><P>Panelist from various organizations gave presentations on their work in the community and program participants from each group spoke about the impact the services they received from the CTC had on their lives. Participants included service providers and participants from:</P><UL><LI>Youth programs&#151;Street Level Youth Media</LI><LI>Multilingual and assistive tech programs&#151;Erie Neighborhood House, Northern Illinois Center for Adaptive Technology, Coalition of African, Asian, European, and Latino Immigrants of Illinois (CAAELII)</LI><LI>Connection and community linkages&#151;Illinois Institute for Technology (IIT) Digital Media Center, IT Resource Center, PrairieNet</LI><LI>Workforce Development&#151;Charles Hayes Family Investment Center, Lincoln Land Community College</LI></UL><P>The most riveting part of the forum was the compelling stories we heard from CTC users. Three examples of these testimonies:</P><P>Zonetta Watts, a single mother of five, stated that she didn't know much about computers applications until her participation in a program for public housing residents at the Charles A. Hayes Family Investment Center program. After completing the program, Zonetta decided to go back to school to obtain her associates degree in computer engineering. She says, "The Hayes center program has helped me gain skills to obtain my A+, MCP, Network+ certifications." Now four years later not only is she an instructor at the Center's technology learning at the center, but she recently purchased her own home.</P><P>Elva Serna completed a program at Erie Neighborhood House that led to her obtaining a job as a supervisor for a food service company. She soon began utilizing the computer skills she received from her Erie House training to translate company materials from English to Spanish information. 90% of the company's workers spoke Spanish. Soon afterwards, she began volunteering with Erie House and then teaching classes. Her sister was one of her first students. Elva stated, "I love working for the community. My participation in the Erie House program changed my life." Elva currently works as Erie's Technology Project Coordinator.<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Times; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;<?xml:namespace prefix = o /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P><P>Christopher, a high school senior said, "Working with StreetLevel Youth Media gave an idea of what I want to do when I grow up."</P><P>All of the CTC users' stories were awesome! They really brought home the importance of our work and reinforced our value to the communities that we serve.</P><P>The forum was followed by a lunch meeting with various state agency representatives, who had been invited to talk to us about their work and how these agencies support the work of Illinois CTCs. After lunch we were escorted to the gallery of the IL House of Representatives, where we were formally introduced to the House by Rep. Connie Howard and received a warm welcome from the Illinois legislators.</P><P>We left the House with legislative packets in tow, off for team meetings with individual legislators. Each team met with the senator and representative in their district to share their stories and invite them to visit their center. After our legislative meetings, we held a debriefing session. Everyone committed to participating in next year's event and recruiting even more people to participate. We also made connections with other representatives to help coordinate next years' Tech Day.</P><P>After a long day, it was time to head home. It was agreed that this year's Illinios Community Technology Day was an exciting and educational event for all.</P><DIV><HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2><I>Debra Walker Johnson (<A href="mailto:dwjohnson@ctcnet.org">dwjohnson@ctcnet.org</A>) is the first full-time director of CTCNet Chicago.</I></DIV><BR></font>

<h3 class="title">Yellow Shirt Alert! California Communities Get Their Policy On</h3>

<IMG alt="" border=0 src="/summer-2003/yellowshirt.gif">On March 25, 2003, over 100 energetic individuals clad in bright yellow shirts descended on the California state capital as participants in Community Technology Sacramento Day. These yellow-shirted activists were community technology leaders and supporters of all ages, who came from all over the state to take part in the exciting policy making-process. As part of an effort to rally underserved communities to be active participants in the digital revolution, the California Community Technology Policy Group (CCTPG) organized this successful second annual Sacramento Day event.</P><P>The day&#8217;s goals were to: (1) raise participants&#8217; awareness of the need and opportunity for them to become involved in policy-making; (2) help participants to be comfortable with the idea that they are often the <I>best</I> advocates for their communities; and (3) teach participants how to be strong advocates for their organizations and their communities.</P><P>The day began with an informative training session that taught participants about the policy-making process and how to effectively communicate with their legislators to advocate for their issues. Some of the issues participants raised included: increasing access to technology, particularly for new and/or inexperienced users; getting funding and other resources to provide technology programs and services in their communities; and getting youth involved in using technology for job training purposes.</P><P>CCTPG was also honored to have other guests in attendance, including State Senator Debra Bowen, to whom CCTPG presented an award for her legislative leadership in the area of community technology. Sen. Bowen has sponsored several community technology bills for which CCTPG played an active advocacy role. <A href="http://www.cctpg.org/legislation/sb1863/sb1683factsheet.htm">SB 1863</A>, which was signed into law last year, allows the utilization of a special fund, the California Teleconnect Fund (CTF), to provide discounted telecommunication services to schools, hospitals, and community-based organizations.</P><P>In addition, Commissioner Loretta Lynch from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) joined the day&#8217;s activities. The CPUC is a state agency that regulates privately-owned telecommunication companies and, as such, is a critical player in all telecommunications policy decisions in California. Commissioner Lynch reviewed three key ways the CPUC planned to modify the CTF. According to Lynch, community-based organizations will be eligible for a 50% discount on their telecommunications expenses, the application process will be streamlined, and it will be unnecessary for users of the CTF to reapply.</P><P>On a related topic, Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh spoke to the group about <A href="http://www.cctpg.org/legislation/">Assembly Bill 855</A>, which would develop a digital divide fund by taking 15% of revenue generated from leasing state-owned property to telecommunication companies.</P><P>Armed with this knowledge of the latest updates in the telecommunication policy scene, participants had the opportunity to brush up their advocacy skills as they role-played their upcoming legislative visits. Once participants got the opportunity to practice their new skills with their assigned teams, they spent the afternoon visiting their legislators. By the end of the day, participants had visited 80 State Senators and Assembly members&#8212;over one-third of the State legislators&#8212;twice as many visits as last year.</P><P>The community technology contingent was especially visible walking through the State Capitol building. Passersby could be overheard commenting on the bright yellow t-shirts. At the end of the day, the yellow shirted crews were tired but excited at the day&#8217;s activities. One participant commented, &#8220;It was nice to find that there are people actively involved in pursuing the issues of accessible technology.&#8221;</P><P>While CCTPG&#8217;s efforts will continue throughout the year, Sacramento Day participants are all looking forward to Sacramento Day 2004 when they can regroup and keep advocating for equitable access to technology so that all of our communities can take part in the digital revolution. "We visited our representative&#8217;s office, and he remembered us from last year,&#8221; said a participant. &#8220;We are looking forward to delivering our message again next year.&#8221;</P><DIV><HR align=center SIZE=2 width="100%"><I>Maricela Carlos (<A href="mailto:mcarlos@communitypartners.org">mcarlos@communitypartners.org</A>) is a Program Associate at Community Partners and is an active member of the California Community Technology Policy Group (CCTPG).

<h3 class="title">Norris Dickard: Striving for Tech Equity</h3>

<TR>
<TD>
<P align=center>Norris Dickard</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>Norris Dickard&#8217;s (<A href="mailto:norris@benton.org">norris@benton.org</A>) policy work at the <A href="http://www.benton.org/">Benton Foundation</A> focuses on educational technology, universal service, and bridging the digital divide. From 1992 to 2001, Dickard worked as a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Department of Education, where he was instrumental in launching key components of former President Clinton's Digital Opportunity Initiative. From 1989 to 1991, Dickard worked as an administrator at Harvard&#8217;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.</I></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<HR align=center SIZE=3 width="100%">
<B>Current Work</B> 
<P>In early 2002, I was part of the steering committee that launched the Digital Empowerment campaign; as part of this effort, I sought to use &#8220;the power of my pen,&#8221; through op-eds and various articles that were published, to engage thought leaders around why it was critical to preserve the TOP and CTC programs, as well as to ensure that all children had access to digital learning opportunities (in their homes, communities, and schools).</P>
<P>As project manager of the Joyce Foundation funded &#8220;Ed-Tech Sustainability Project&#8221; I was proud that on December 11, 2002, our findings from the project were released in the form of a publication, <I><A href="http://www.benton.org/Library/sustainability/sus_challenge.pdf">The Sustainability Challenge: Taking Educational Technology to the Next Level</A></I>. The venue was a well-attended national policy forum at the National Press Club. It has a number of recommendations related to the digital divide. We are interested in doing a similar project in the community technology access space, building on our recent work in the launching of <A href="http://www.benton.org/webjunction.html">Webjunction</A>.</P>
<P>For the last six months, I&#8217;ve been actively working on the debate over the nation&#8217;s media <A href="http://www.benton.org/ownership/">media ownership rules</A> which unfortunately have been made less restrictive by the FCC, impacting local control and the diversity of voices so necessary in a democracy.</P>
<P><B>Challenges</B></P>
<P>It&#8217;s disheartening to see the Bush Administration continue not to request funding for direct federal support for CTCs but instead point to the ed-tech block grant as the source of funds. I am shocked about the huge cuts to the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century Learning Centers Program. Early on, Peter Miller, other community technology proponents, and I worked to get folks to apply for these funds and use school facilities for community technology access. Now it is just being judged on whether student test scores went up, when the Congressional mandate for this program was much broader.</P>
<P><B>Rewards</B></P>
<P>The biggest reward for me is working on such an important issue as technology equity and ensuring that everyone thrives in the digital age. My work energizes me. I just spoke at a Pan-African Conference that was held in Botswana and which focused on school and community technology. Hopefully I provided some good advice for them to consider in writing their telecommunications laws and related regulations.</P>
<P><B>Some Words of Advice</B></P>
<P>In a time when federal leadership is woefully lacking it is so important to look at policy innovations on the state and local levels&#8212;and for others to emulate these innovators. Models like the <A href="http://zerodivide.org/">Community Technology Foundation Programs in California</A>, in crafting state universal service policies, and <A href="http://www.one-economy.com/">One Economy</A>, in the housing arena, are good examples. There are many others.</P>
<P><B>A Look Ahead</B></P>
<P>As to the future, the Benton Foundation sees a profound opportunity today: an opportunity to help approximately 13 million underserved young adults ages 16-28 develop and apply the "21st Century skills" necessary to improve their lives. The foundation and its partners are embarking on a multi-year initiative to identify, develop and promote successful community-based strategies to use media and communications tools to empower youth. The campaign will unite community leaders, decision-makers, the business sector, researchers and practitioners nationally, and in partnering cities, to tackle this challenge. We believe that strategic community interventions, using media and technology, can make a substantial difference in the lives of young people who have fallen through the cracks in the educational system, creating new pathways to economic success and social inclusion.

<h3 class="title">Doreen Thomas -- Technological Literacy Toward Technological Fluency</h3>

<I>This article is part three of a three-part series that shares case studies from the Creating Community Connections Project, an ongoing effort at Camfield Estates, a predominantly African-American, low- to moderate-income housing development in Roxbury, MA, since 1999. As part of this project, MIT researchers have worked with residents to establish a technological infrastructure by offering every family a new computer, software, and high-speed Internet connection, along with comprehensive course and a web-based community building system. The project combines these elements in an effort to achieve a social and cultural resonance that integrates both community technology and community building by leveraging indigenous assets.</P>
<P>The first article in this series, "<A href="article.php?article_id=113">Edna Jackson, Technology and Community Building: From Staunchest Opponent to Greatest Proponent</A>,&#8221; profiled Edna Jackson, a senior citizen and survivor of emphysema, and demonstrated the positive influence a community can exert on its members. The second installment portrayed the experiences of the resident project leader <A href="article.php?article_id=37">Rodney Williams</A>, a college student, and his evolution throughout the initiative. This third and final narrative shares the story of Doreen Thomas, and provides a deeper context for understanding what it means to move from technological literacy toward technological fluency as an entrepreneur.</I></P>
<HR align=center SIZE=3 width="100%">
<B>The Story of Doreen Thomas</B> 
<P>The year was 1986 and Doreen Thomas, a single mother of three, was unemployed and in search of her next position. One year earlier she left her job working on the bar scene to pursue a family day care operation run out of her home. When she became dissatisfied with childcare as a long-term career move, she worked an interim job. During that time Doreen, a graduate of hairdressing school, was reminded of her degree in cosmetology that she had successfully completed a few years ago. This prompted her to take an open position at a local hair salon.</P>
<P>Unimpressed with their level of service and professionalism, she quickly came to the conclusion that she could a run a better hair salon herself. After only eight weeks of employment. she quit this job, convinced two of her close friends to contribute the $1,100 she needed as a deposit, along with an additional $5,000 to purchase equipment and furniture, and secured a storefront on Tremont St. in Roxbury. As a result, on August 19, 1986, A-1 Concepts of Hair Gallery, Inc. was founded.</P>
<P>Doreen, a resident at Camfield since 1972 and long-time member of the adjacent People&#8217;s Baptist Church, is one of a number of small business owners at the development. An extremely confident and outspoken woman, she is also one of the founding members of the Camfield Tenants Association where she remains active to this day, along with her youngest daughter.</P>
<P><B>Preparing for the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century</B></P>
<P>When the Camfield Estates-MIT project arrived, Dorreen was one of the first to sign up for the program. She had been using computers and the Internet for a number of years as a result of using a computer to manage A-1&#8217;s operations, including general record keeping, a customer tracking database, and a web site. However, she had not previously enrolled in a computer course, which limited her use primarily to sending/receiving e-mail and browsing the web.</P>
<P>"I had already purchased about three computers&#8230; but I had very limited skills on the computer. I knew how to put my data in at the salon,&#8221; said Dorreen. &#8220;What other kinds of things was I doing? Personal. No work. Like, my girlfriend lives in Connecticut. She was e-mailing me and stuff. Yeah, that was about it. Susan would e-mail, too, and that was it. Then go on different web sites when you see them on TV and go see what they have. You know, get information.&#8221;</P>
<P>In addition to the prospects of a new computer and high-speed Internet access, one of the attractive features of the project was the opportunity to augment her skills. She completed the ten-week course along with the other participants in Round I, and received her computer on November 15, 2000. However, what was perhaps of greater benefit than any specific skill she acquired during the course was a completely new attitude toward learning. &#8220;I&#8217;m more confident now,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I can do more. I didn&#8217;t know before, now I do now.&#8221;</P>
<P>Armed with a new set of competencies and a new perspective, in January 2001, Doreen happened upon a booklet in her mailbox from an independent distributor for the Herbalife company. &#8220;Sometimes you look at stuff, and it looks good to you [and] you read it. And sometimes you get stuff that doesn&#8217;t look good and you just throw it way, right? So this day I happened to look at the book, and I said, &#8216;Oh.&#8217; So I read it. I read the whole book, [and] being I had a computer I went, and I pulled up the stuff&#8230; I read all the information, and it sounded good to me.&#8221; It sounded so good, in fact, that Doreen decided to contact the distributor, a woman named Chris.</P>
<P><B>Sowing the Seeds of Entreprenership, Again</B></P>
<P>Doreen, intrigued by the product offering and the prospect of earning some additional money from home, purchased an initial information packet from Chris. After a follow-up telephone conversation, Doreen was sold on the opportunity. She then purchased a complete set of marketing materials and Herbalife products, making her an independent distributor for the company.</P>
<P>With the company&#8217;s assistance, Doreen then registered the domain and assembled a fully-functioning web site complete with online marketing information, credit card billing, usage statistics, and a web-based request form that automatically notifies her of potentially interested customers via e-mail. She has also sought ways to integrate technology into other aspects of her business.</P>
<P>"Since I&#8217;ve gotten the computer I have been able to print out my envelopes for my new business in the different formats. Also, I communicate everyday by email with the Herbalife system. I&#8217;m currently being mentored by the Herbalife system through email and faxes. This allows me to run my business from home.</P>
<P>"I also communicate via touch phone (conference calls). That&#8217;s how they talk to us. We get our reports as well as product reports, and if we need to find out some information on [anything]&#8230; if somebody has some kind of ailment, we put it out on touch phone and the people that are listening to us, whoever their clients are or customers are that have had positive results on this&#8230; talk to us back. And then we get our faxes from Herbalife through there. And my upline sends me faxes or things to help."</P>
<P>In addition to the items mentioned above, Doreen expressed a strong interest in learning more about Microsoft Word to design flyers and other marketing materials, and about Microsoft Excel, to track inventory and expenses for her new business. She has also made use of the Camfield Estates web site to seek advice and further her marketing efforts. For example, when searching for recommendations on a good book about Microsoft Word, she posted her question to the &#8220;Help&#8221; discussion forum. Furthermore, her Herbalife business is listed in the resident directory and also on her resident profile. Lastly, shortly after completing the courses at Camfield Technology Center, she and her daughter entered A-1 into the Camfield online business directory database.</P>
<P><B>Toward Greater Technological Fluency</B></P>
<P>A-1 Concepts of Hair Gallery, Inc., has been a profitable and rewarding endeavor for Doreen and her family for more than fifteen years now. There is every reason to believe that this success will continue well into the future. Doreen&#8217;s Herbalife business is still in its infancy. Her current plan is to assemble the time and resources she needs to grow her second entrepreneurial venture into another viable and lucrative entity.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that alongside Doreen&#8217;s personal and professional evolution has existed a parallel and interrelated path toward greater technological literacy. She has steadily moved from record keeping and data entry to e-mail and web-browsing to strategic use of the Internet for business. While she has not taken an active role in building either of her two web sites, she has a very clear understanding of how to make productive use of these sites as well as other digital technologies (i.e., computer, fax, etc).</P>
<P>This suggests that her trajectory is now in the direction of achieving greater technological fluency, or knowing how to construct things of significance with technological tools. The evidence for this claim is found in her articulated desire to create flyers and brochures and even birthday cards. Such creative activities lie at the very core of the notion of being an active creator and producer. First, they facilitate expression and require a &#8220;product&#8221; from the end-user. Second, they are social endeavors, meaning there is an implicit audience for whom they are targeted such as family members, friends, or neighbors. Doreen can be expected to be engaged in a number of more fluent activities in the future.</P>
<P>Finally, what stands out from Doreen&#8217;s story is not the fact that she has started two business, although that is a laudable accomplishment in its own right. What is most impressive is the way she has leveraged local resources (family, friends, Technology Center staff, etc) and fashioned technology to achieve these goals while advancing a community-minded agenda. For Doreen, perhaps more important than being fluent, she has demonstrated a capacity to get there.</P>

<TABLE align=left border=0 cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0 style="HEIGHT: 249px; WIDTH: 227px" width=227>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><IMG alt="" border=0 src="/summer-2003/LM5_Jemeul.jpg"></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>&#8220;My loves in life are people and technology, the arts and sciences,&#8221; says Jemeul Johnson (<A href="mailto:jjohnson@sciencelinkages.org">jjohnson@sciencelinkages.org</A>), Program Coordinator for <A href="http://www.sciencelinkages.org/ccrpage.htm">Community Computers for Rochester</A>, NY, a Science Linkages in the Community (SLIC) project. After graduating with a B.S. in Communications in 1994, Johnson began working as a technical and instructional consultant in the <A href="http://www.rcsdk12.org/schools/middle/ftlc.htm">Dr. Freddie Thomas Learning Center</A>, a school that stresses computer and media technology&#8217;s importance in the development of students, families, and the community. And when an opportunity arose at SLIC, Jemeul was eager to continue his work building and strengthening Rochester&#8217;s computer access programs.</I></P>
<HR align=center SIZE=3 width="100%">
<B>Current Work</B> 
<P>For the past two and a half years, I&#8217;ve been the Project Coordinator for the Community Computers for Rochester project which received a three-year grant to establish 30 community technology centers in the Rochester area, in organizations that wanted CTCs or wanted help with the CTCs that were already running. My job is to carry the baton in a way, to be the drum major.</P>
<P>Each CTC works with us for two years. The first year is for setting up centers&#8212;for overseeing the design and building of the center, for developing staff, and for creating the CTC environment. This sometimes involved work with architects, engineers, overall vision. During the second year, each center creates a tech plan.</P>
<P>What we provide to the CTC during this time are three things: technology, human resources, and curriculum development. With the technology, we help them with their networking, with installation, with connecting their center to the larger community network. We provide encouragement for management, staff, and volunteers. We help them coordinate their team and develop problem-solving and other leadership skills. We give them a resource CD with operations, curriculum (we don&#8217;t dictate curriculum&#8212;they create curriculum that fits their community&#8217;s needs), instructions for developing a tech plan, and free software and tools&#8212;needs that are common among all centers.</P>
<P>Community-wide, I&#8217;ve been working with the City of Rochester and with the Academy for Career Development on the virtual help desk, CommuniTech. No tech support? Call into the Help Desk. Our goal is to have 45 CTCs and non-profits connected so we can fix computers remotely. Fifteen are connected now, and 30 more will be connected by the close of 2003.</P>
<P>Another exciting thing is that we&#8217;re launching a Marketing Campaign with the Ad Council of Rochester and a private marketing company. CTCNet worked to bring CTCs up to this level of national marketing, and we&#8217;re working on this with the intent that this can become a replicable program. With our program, CTCs can utilize opt-in branding and become a &#8220;Cyberlink&#8221; center (to debut in November 2003).We&#8217;ll have a poster campaign that drives home the message &#8220;Computer Skills Matter.&#8221;</P>
<P><B>Challenges</B></P>
<P>One thing that comes to mind is staff capacity. It&#8217;s not so much that people are often coming and going&#8212;that&#8217;s a challenge, but we have ways to solve that right out. When I talk about staff capacity, I mean it takes a lot of people to run, manage, carry, and develop wonderful CTCs.</P>
<P>Another thing is getting the boards and directors of some organizations to really take their tech centers seriously from the beginning. After the set up year, the CTCs still face a lot of work. Directors are often shocked to see the tech plans, so that&#8217;s why we require a memorandum of understanding, so they plan for collaborations, for monthly meetings, for some time before the community really starts coming around to the idea of their new CTC.</P>
<P><B>The Rewards</B></P>
<P>I&#8217;m happy to be part of the CTC behind the CTC.</P>
<P><B>Some Words of Advice</B></P>
<P>See the big picture first, and then work backwards. Make what you are doing sustainable.</P>
<P><B>Looking Ahead</B></P>
<P>Community technology is rapidly becoming not just about community access. It&#8217;s worked its way into all aspects of community development and building the utopia that people have been talking about.</P>

<h3 class="title">Closing the Content Gap: a Content Evaluation and Creation Starter Kit</h3>

<P>Anyone who works at a community technology program knows that helping clients find the very best online resources is a challenging task but one of critical importance.</P>
<P>In March of 2000, The Children's Partnership published "<A href="http://www.contentbank.org/research.asp">Online Content for Low-income and Underserved Americans</A>," the result of a year-long study that identified a lack of Internet content (especially in such crucial areas as education, employment, housing, and health) that was accessible to low-income and other underserved Americans. Users with limited-literacy or English skills encountered significant barriers to being able to fully benefit from online information, which often was written at an average or advanced literacy level or was available in English exclusively. Additionally, we identified a lack of content addressing the unique interests of cultural and ethnic communities as well as local content with neighborhood-level information.</P>
<P>Since the release of the report three years ago, The Children's Partnership has been pleased to learn how this report has served as a catalyst for on-the-ground efforts in online content development. We have heard from numerous organizations that used that March 2000 report, combined with a large dose of their own expertise, to guide them in either finding or creating resources to meet the unique needs of their clients.</P>
<P>The Children's Partnership is now taking the next step, from identifying the content gap to identifying strategies to begin to close it&#151;developing recommendations to shape both content evaluation and production. In the summer of 2003, The Children's Partnership will present the results of our research in this area. In the meantime, we are including examples of two pioneering efforts in the New York City area that began by creating their own criteria for evaluating and selecting online resources for their clients, and then used those very same criteria to develop web sites that meet the unique needs of the people they serve&#151;FirstFind, a project of area libraries, and Computer Corner, a project of Computers for Youth.</P>
<P>In addition, we have provided the following "starter tools" that you can begin to use immediately in your work:</P>
<LI>A sampling of articles and research that come from a variety of fields and offer a range of perspectives on the issue of content evaluation.</LI>
<LI>Links to guidelines that have been created in some of the fields that are leading the way in content evaluation, including health, education, and literacy.<BR></LI>
<TABLE>

<TD vAlign=top width=738><IMG alt="" src="/summer-2003/PC1_firstfind_masthead.gif" border=0> 
<P>Public libraries are often the first point of contact for individuals seeking access to online resources, and librarians are all too familiar with the barriers many patrons face in finding resources they can understand and use. For example many library patrons, especially those in low-income neighborhoods, encounter primarily web sites that assume a higher level of reading skills than they have.</P>
<P>It is with a deep understanding of this problem that the Westchester Library System, New York Public Library, Brooklyn Public Library, Queens Borough Public Library, and the American Library Association's Office of Literacy and Outreach Services, with funding from the New York State Library, developed. <A href="http://www.firstfind.info/">FirstFind</A>. FirstFind is a virtual library that provides information to low-level readers and adults with limited English skills. The general and local information on the web site has been evaluated, annotated, and systematically organized by librarians.</P>
<P>The developers of FirstFind were guided by the principle that individuals, regardless of their reading skills or English language proficiency, need and want information on a full range of subjects. However, the site's developers took into account the types of questions commonly asked in libraries when prioritizing the topics to include on FirstFind, such as health, education, employment, parenting, and citizenship.</P>
<P>During the first year of the project, FirstFind had two major goals:</P>
<OL>
<LI>To train librarians to identify and evaluate informational web sites appropriate for adults learning English and acquiring basic skills proficiency; and</LI>
<LI>To construct a virtual library of these web sites, organized by subject area.</LI></OL>
<P>The development of FirstFind consisted of several steps, including convening a planning committee to steer the project, training twenty-nine librarians as web site evaluators, and evaluating hundreds of web sites. A vital part of the project was the development of evaluation criteria for both selecting resources for inclusion on the FirstFind web site and guiding the development of the web site itself.</P>
<P>Since the launch of FirstFind, 10,000 people have visited the site. The most popular topics have been education, technology, health, and government. Several public libraries in the New York City area provide a link to FirstFind on their homepages; The National Cancer Institute uses FirstFind as a tool to teach seniors to find information on the Internet; a community technology center in Yonkers features FirstFind as an important resource for grandparents who are raising their grandchildren; and an ESL instructor in Washington uses FirstFind with students because the language level of the resources has been assessed in advance.</P>
<P>FirstFind is an exciting and important model. The guidelines the FirstFind team developed include the following criteria:</P>
<P>The web site:</P>
<LI>Has content which is of high interest and suitable for adults </LI>
<LI>Provides accurate, complete, reliable, current information</LI>
<LI>Is easy and efficient to navigate </LI>
<LI>Is easy to read</LI>
<LI>Has good graphic design for adults </LI>
<LI>Makes its bias clear if it has one, or is fair in presentation of points of view </LI>
<LI>Does not have as its primary purpose advertising commercial products </LI>
<LI>Loads reasonably fast </LI>
<LI>Takes into consideration the needs of differently-abled students </LI>
<P>Currently, the FirstFind team is expanding the online library and revising its structure to encourage the submission of geographically specific resources that meet these same criteria. Find full guidelines and additional information about the project <A href="http://www.contentbank.org/research.asp">on the FirstFind Info web site</A>.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<H1>Community Corner</H1>
<P><A href="http://www.communitycorner.org/">Community Corner</A> is a project of <A href="http://www.cfy.org/">Computers for Youth</A>&nbsp;(CFY), an organization that helps low-income students become engaged learners by using technology to improve their learning environment. CFY works with public middle schools in poor neighborhoods in the New York metropolitan area and offers each family and teacher a home computer and other services, including training, email accounts, Internet access, technical support, and tailored web content at their Community Corner web site.</P>
<P>Community Corner contains content in both English and Spanish that is geared toward the community it serves&#151;low-income youth and adults who are first-time computer and Internet users. The Community Corner site includes the following sections: Home, School, Playground, Money Center, Health Center, Job Center, Community Center, Tech Support Center, and Internet Safety.</P>
<P>To ensure that Community Corner is useful to its intended audience, CFY involves community members in all aspects of its design and construction. The site is developed and maintained by low-income and minority interns, who are chosen to design graphics and content that reflect their communities. For instance, thanks to a suggestion from Sindy Rivera&#151;a web design intern and mother on public assistance&#151;CFY's web design team is developing a section on Community Corner devoted to preparing people for both the emotional and academic sides of the GED, based in part on Sindy's own experience.</P>
<P>In its selection of resources for Community Corner and its development of the site itself, CFY takes into account barriers that typically prevent individuals with low-income levels and limited literacy skills from engaging with existing material on the web. In particular, they follow the guidelines below:</P>
<LI>Design content around topics that are culturally and economically relevant;</LI>
<LI>Present information in both English and Spanish;</LI>
<LI>Develop content that is visually appealing and inviting (e.g., colors, characters, and visual metaphors that engage the target audience);</LI>
<LI>Create text at a middle school reading level (6th-8th grade) that is appropriately "chunked" and is in a large font size so as not to intimidate fledgling readers;</LI>
<LI>Supplement text explanations with visuals when possible.</LI>
<LI>Offer remediation opportunities around concepts that might be particularly difficult to grasp (e.g., percentages in the Money Center); and</LI>
<LI>Create content that loads easily on low-end computers that are connected to the Internet with 56k modems.</LI>
<P>CFY also conducts user tests of the Community Corner web site at least fifteen times per year. They observe how members of their target audience interact with the site and assess its appeal, comprehensibility, and usability. They modify the site's design and content based on that feedback. For example, after watching children struggle with financial literacy concepts, CFY created the Money Center that features characters of different ages engaging in practices of saving, budgeting, and building credit.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<h3 class="title">Nyvia Col&#243;n: Real-Life Assignments, Real-Life Lessons</h3>

<I>Nyvia Col&#151;n (<A href="mailto:ncolon@madison-park.org">ncolon@madison-park.org</A>) grew up in Boston in the early 1970s when things were tough for the minority community immigrating to the area. Her parents&#151;illiterate themselves&#151;were not aware of the importance of becoming involved in their children's education. Due to the lack of parental support and peer pressure, Col&#151;n dropped out of high school in 1982, at age seventeen. Twenty-plus years and many hurdles later, Col&#151;n is truly happy that she chose go on to higher education, to secure and excel in her position as IT Director for the Lower Roxbury Technology Goes Home program.</I></P><HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=3><B>Current Work</B> <P>At the Lower Roxbury TGH, Nyvia Col&#151;n is an innovator, coordinator, and instructor. She has taken basic computer curriculum and has modified it to include real-life practical assignments. Col&#151;n uses fact sheets that explain the high numbers of teenage pregnancies and people with credit card debt in the Roxbury area. She includes stories about programs developed to help people get out of debt and other topics that elicit dialogue. Students type from these fact sheets as they learn how to navigate and utilize Microsoft Word.</P><P>In order for families to learn Excel, she has them understand the importance of financial planning. She has them create a list that indicates the amount owed to credit card companies, the amount of interest being paid, and the credit card company phone numbers. The assignment then is to create a simple spreadsheet that provides them with the fundamentals for working in Excel. The next assignment is to create a budget that they must update weekly.</P><P>For children, Col&#151;n promotes the positive self-fulfilling prophecy. She has students identify their dream job as they write a story in MSWord. The children create resume-like documents that identify what they want to be when they grow up and provide a space to keep track of all the successes they have had throughout their years leading up to college.</P><P>"As a technology program instructor and an inspirational speaker, I have drawn from my own life experience to deliver effective life-changing workshops and seminars. I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn in their comfort zone, meaning whether they learn best by seeing, hearing, or doing, I'm going to make sure that whatever I'm teaching is interactive and leaves space for sharing ideas."</P><P><B>Challenges</B></P><P>The challenges I have faced are that many instructors are comfortable with a certain way to teaching (lecture) and provide our residents a negative experience when it comes to learning. Learning should be fun and interactive, conducted in an environment that encourages group participation, critical thinking, and problem solving.</P><P><B>The Rewards</B></P><P>The most rewarding thing for me is to see all the positive changes families are making. They are receiving better paying jobs, better grades, better parent/child relationships, and more thirst for knowledge. They're taking pride in their neighborhoods, sharing ideas and information with their neighbors, fulfilling their civic duty as a way of giving back with the understanding that others have the same opportunity they did by going through the program.</P><P><B>Some Words of Advice</B></P><P>Developing a need assessment for your clients is the most important step in helping you develop a comprehensive plan to help them. If many of your clients are having issues with depression, then you must help them work that out before trying to move forward with any other programs. Many of our clients' negative attitudes towards the institutions that are set up to help them are passed down from generation to generation. Therefore we must gain the trust and respect for what we are doing before people in our neighborhood begin to knock on our doors again.</P><P>Remember to respect all individuals as you would like to be respected and most important: don't be judgmental. People who are poverty-stricken have a lot more issues than that of not having money. Empowerment is the key.</P><P><B>Looking Ahead</B></P><P>I see an opportunity for CTCs to become hands-on training institutions that provide graduates real life opportunities to work as a contractor or in a developed business within the CTC as a way to gain experience. It will also help the CTCs with funding if they can develop a for-profit entity within their non-profit organization.</P><P><HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=3><I>This interview builds upon and expands the sidebar piece on Nyvia in the <A href="http://www.convergemag.com/"><FONT face=Times>convergmag.com</FONT></A><FONT face=Times>'s October 2002 story, "<A href="http://www.convergemag.com/magazine/story.phtml?id=29346">Going to Scale with Boston's Revolution</A>."</I>

<h3 class="title">CTCs and Social Change: Success Story Contest Winners</h3>

We all know how incredibly valuable our work is to our community, but we also know that's not enough. Everyone else has to know it, too. One of the most important things we can do right now, given these uncertain budget times, is to develop and disseminate a compelling case for community technology centers.</P>
<P>CTCNet is working on a number of strategies to demonstrate and document the success and importance of our work. Sharing success stories that help put a face on the issues and challenges is one strategy that we introduced last year. And it is having an impact. We have collected thirty-six stories from CTCs around the U.S.</P>
<P>This year we have selected several topics of focus for the <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/stories/v4/index.htm">CTC Success Stories</A>. The first topic was “CTCs and Social Change.” The work so many CTCs are doing to provide communities that are digitally disenfranchised with access to computers and the Internet is about creating social change. CTCs ensure that lack of economic resources does not prohibit people from engaging in technology enhanced learning opportunities. They provide individuals and communities that otherwise cannot afford it with opportunities to use technology to participate in an increasingly connected society.</P>
<P>Several CTCNet affiliates sent in stories about how they are helping community members to access and inform government services, promote civic participation, participate in the democratic process, and advocate to improve their communities.</P>
<P>CTCNet is pleased to announce the results of the Fourth CTC Success Story Contest. All of the entries were strong and it was difficult to choose the top three stories. After much deliberation, we have selected three winners:</P>
<LI>"And We All SHiNE On…" relates the experience of a group of teens at the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky who participated in a video conference with teens in Philadelphia and New York City. Eighth grader Aaron Harris said, "We learned about each others' different communities, about diversity, segregation, racism, and discrimination." The video conference also served to stimulate and motivate the youth to take action and tackle the issues in their own communities.</LI>
<LI>"SPiCYAM" is a personal success story about a young man, Rocky Myers, who walked a mile or so to attend digital video classes in Shawnee, OH. Through his participation in the center, Rocky produced video projects that have been shown at the Athens International Film Festival, Appalachian Film Festival, and the Buckeye Ranch Film Festival. A high school student who had poor grades, Rocky has since raised his GPA to 3.7 and plans to attend college to study filmmaking.</LI>
<LI>"Media Bridges' Success Story," exemplifies how various citizens in Cincinnati, OH are using television, radio, and the Internet to voice their concerns, to find solutions and share them.</LI>
<P>The next success story contest will be announced at the annual conference in June. Future CTC Success Story Topics will include: (1) Success with Content Development, (2) Using Multi-Media and Digital Graphic Tools, (3) Intergenerational Activities in your CTCs, (4) Serving People with Special Abilities. Winners receive their choice of either free CTCNet conference registration or a one year extension on their current CTCNet membership.</P>

<h3 class="title">Computer Recycling/Refurbishing in Rural Washington State and at the CTCNet Conference</h3>

<I>The conference session on computer recycling and refurbishing for beginners covers successful programs, where to get hardware/software, and what to do with it when you get it. Advice will be offered on designing assessments of what equipment and hardware both organizations and individuals need versus what they think they want.</I></P>
<P>By developing a model program for the effective use of recycled computers, the <A href="http://www.tcfn.org/cbpin/recycle.htm">RECA Foundation</A> has been working to meet the technology needs of the Tri-Cities community since 1992. It has helped establish 10 technology centers, built and run the <A href="http://www.tcfn.org/">Columbia Free-Net,</A> recycled computer equipment to low income families, and helped to build the technology capacity of our local non-profit organizations through low-cost, recycled hardware, and technology planning and training. Supporters and collaborators of RECA and CBPIN include Webbworks, Meier Enterprises, Boss Internet, the Human Services Coalition, the Kennewick School District, and the Mid-Columbia Library.</P>
<P>RECA offers recycled computers at reduced cost to low-income and disabled community members in the Tri-Cities-area. The beginning computer, sold for $100, is designed to help a new user learn to type, read, do math, learn geography, paint, write, and learn basic computer skills. This computer allows users to explore without concern about damage to the computer—an ideal setup for young children, non-English speakers, people with learning disabilities, and adults with no computer experience. The security system, which doesn't allow one to add, delete, or modify system software, protects the computer from costly repairs and maintenance. These refurbished computers include over 20 educational software programs such as: Reader Rabbit, Math Rabbit , The Oregon Trail, Where in Space is Carmen San Diego, Merlin’s Math, Dino Geography, Dino Add/Subtract, Alge-Blaster (Algebra program), Treasure Cove, Letter Chase Typing Tutor, Hoyle’s Book of Games, Paintbrush, and MS Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Notepad).</P>
<P>RECA also offers an Internet-ready computer for $250. This computer provides word processing software and other programs to assist in study and work related activities. Donated Internet accounts are available for eligible students and low income families. Additionally, RECA offers accessibility assistance and computer maintenance and training at reduced rates.</P>
<P><I>The <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/conf/2003/at_conference/program_detail.asp?SessionID=47">session</A> complements the Birds of a Feather session for techie-to-techie discussion.</I></P>
<HR align=center SIZE=3 width="100%">
<I>Ronda Evans (<A href="mailto:revans@tcfe.org">revans@tcfn.org</A>) is President, Co-Founder, and Co-Manager of the RECA Foundation.</I>

<h3 class="title">Technology Scout and Digital Storyteller</h3>

<TABLE style="WIDTH: 216px; HEIGHT: 262px" cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=216 align=left border=0><TBODY><TR><TD><IMG alt="" src="/summer-2003/T4_phil2003-1.jpg" border=0></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>If you're on any community technology-related listservs, you likely recognize the name Phil Shapiro. CTCNet considers him their "technology scout," and he consistently comes through for the rest of us with technology updates, fun links, and other technology tips.</EM></P><P><EM>After finishing law school at</EM> <EM>Howard University School of Law</EM> <EM>in 1986, Phil Shapiro went exploring non-law careers. He was heading in the direction of becoming a journalist until a day in May, 1988, when he went to the public library near his house, picked up a copy of</EM> Ms. Magazine<I> and read about a community technology center that Toni Stone helped create in Harlem. "That magazine article knocked me over," says Shapiro. "I was already attuned to educational disparities from volunteering at the East Harlem Tutorial Program when I was in high school. In the summer of 1988, I visited Playing To Win and decided that working to expand technology access would be a worthy way to spend a life." </I></P><P><I>Shapiro was teaching himself how to program computers at that time and decided to donate some logic puzzles he designed to Playing To Win. "Imagine my surprise and delight a month later to receive a detailed written review of the software I had donated. This software review had been written by youth and adults at Playing To Win&#151;printed out on their new laser printer. Clearly, something very right was going on at that center."</I></P><HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2><B>Current Work</B> <P>I currently work for myself as a freelance computer consultant, while I'm looking for my next job.</P><P>I'm currently exploring how blogs (web logs) can be used for personal journalism and to knit together communities. I'm also fascinated with community-produced audio and video that's distributed over the Internet and with digital storytelling in all its forms&#151;especially digital storytelling created with low-cost and free software tools. For those who might be interested, the current address of my blog is near the top of my <A href="http://www.his.com/pshapiro/">personal web site</A>.</P><P>I'm also exploring various free software tools, such as OpenOffice.org and GIMP (Gnu Image Manipulation Program.) I've been working on some pro bono Flash projects with a Flash expert who I know only via email. If you've never worked on creative projects with others online, it's something you ought to experience sometime. There's nothing quite like different people contributing their complementary talents to create something unique and valuable. As a career goal, I'd like to be doing more of this.</P><P><B>Challenges</B></P><P>My largest challenge has been in finding a new job after having left my last one a year ago.</P><P><B>The Rewards</B></P><P>It's hard to say precisely what the most rewarding thing is, but meeting people who are "social innovators" and "community builders" is a big kick. I find a lot of inspiration with colleagues here in town and in other cities. I am awed by the community-spirit of the open source software movement. I hope to contribute in small ways to moving this great concept forward. I am also actively involved in several computer clubs in the Washington DC-area and strive to connect the user group community with the CTC community.</P><P>I also stay in touch with some of the families that I've taken donated computers to. It's heartwarming watching the kids grow up and saying to them, "Hey, do you remember when... ?" These kids know that I generally won't help them with specific homework assignments, but I am there to answer questions like, "Why did you choose the career you did?" and "Which persons do you admire in history?" The kids know I'm nuts about the Wright Brothers. They've heard more Wright Brothers stories than they ever cared to know&#151;with each story illustrating an important life lesson. There are others in history I admire, and the kids get an earful when they ask me.</P><P><B>Some Words of Advice</B></P><P>There are a lot of opportunities to learn from one's peers. At the same time, there is "strength in numbers," in being unified. If technology access activists are to make a dent, they need to be more willing to join forces to deliver a unified voice to the public. If we're not banded together, then we're easy to ignore.</P><P>I'd also like to pass along some friendly advice to folks involved in computer recycling projects. Be careful not to drop computers and monitors on your feet. The first time I did this I cursed under my breath, the second time I cursed a bit louder and the fifth time I said to myself, "I can't continue dropping computers and monitors on my feet. It's just unfair to a decent and hardworking appendage of my body."</P><P><B>Looking Ahead</B></P><P>As I see it, the only way for community technology centers to become an established fixture in our society is for this new institution to be funded on par with public libraries and other essential institutions. We don't ask firefighters to write grant proposals, do we? Or ambulance workers, we don't ask them to write reports explaining why their work is needed, do we? Their work is essential, and everbody knows it. The work of CTC's is essential, too. So then how can we establish fixed, non-fluctuating funding for CTCs? Easy. Tax every new computer sold 50 cents. No one will ever notice the difference between a $1250 computer and a $1250.50 computer. Bingo. Steady revenue stream.</P><P>There's a legislative answer to the funding issue, if only our legislators had better foresight of the dividends such legislation would create. I haven't seen much leadership on this issue at the legislative level, although to be sure there are supporters of the CTC movement in Congress. These supporters need to be introducing legislation that deals with the CTC funding issue at the national level. CTCs also need to be paying more of their own way. They cannot survive using an "everything we offer to the community is free" model. That's a recipe for rapid extinction.
