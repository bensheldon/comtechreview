Since 1993 the Computer Museum in Boston, MA has housed the Computer
Clubhouse, an innovative after-school learning center where young
people from Boston's underserved communities can explore their
own interests and become confident learners through the use of
technology.  In 1996 the Computer Museum is launching satellite
versions of the Computer Clubhouse in two Boston communities,
enabling hundreds more inner-city youths to get their hands on
powerful computer tools and create their own projects.

The Computer Museum is providing expertise, training, and support
for Clubhouse satellites at Roxbury's John A. Shelburne Community
Center and United South End Settlements, both opening in early
1996.  Crystal Houston, Shelburne's program director, says that
young people at Shelburne are eager to explore the latest software
and computers.  &quot;Above everything else, having a Clubhouse
here in Roxbury will expand their creativity and tap into resources
they didn't know they had,&quot; she predicts.

The Computer Museum founded the Computer Clubhouse three years
ago in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab.  The Clubhouse has
enabled more than 1,000 young people from Boston's underserved
communities to be introduced to sophisticated professional software
and computer technology.  Guided by adult mentors, youths aged
10-18 work in a community of their peers on their own creations-from
a computer-controlled laser light show to robots and computer
games.  They experiment with scientific simulations, mix music
in the Clubhouse sound studio, and create multimedia presentations.

Setting up satellite Clubhouses in Boston communities is the first
step in the Museum's broader plan to establish a network of Clubhouses
around the country and the world.  The Computer Museum Clubhouse
is developing workshop and consulting materials to offer to museums
and other organizations around the world interested in serving
as Clubhouse &quot;hosts.&quot; These &quot;hosts&quot; in turn
would then set up their own Clubhouse satellites.

&quot;The Clubhouse is a new kind of learning community, where
young people develop new skills and new ways of thinking about
learning and themselves,&quot; noted Clubhouse Advisor Mitch Resnick,
assistant professor, MIT Media Lab.  &quot;The best way to develop
the skills and attitudes needed to succeed in a digital world
is to live in a 'digital community,' interacting not only with
computers but with people who know how to explore and express
themselves with the technology.&quot;
