<h3>Science and Math in Queens at Reap and Keep</h3>
Reap &amp; Keep Educational Services has for the past ten months
been involved in developing and using handson science, math, engineering
and technology (SMET) activities.  The idea was first suggested
by Andrea KimmichKeyser, CTCNet's NY Coordinator.  At that time
I was not even aware of handson anything!  So to acquaint myself
with this phenomenon, I started a research journey that was informative
and stimulating and which included a visit to the NY Hall of Science
that was phenomenal!

<p>At last June's AllAffiliate Network meeting,
the handson science and math sessions provided me with insight
into a variety of activities that promote youth's interest in
science, math, engineering and technology.   Thanks to the Network's
handson science and math grant and to Kelly Wedding, the Network's
online activities consultant, we developed a series of eight workshops
on the theme of electricity and magnetism.  Kelly helped us engage
youth in developing their own projects, allowing them to be active
in the learning process.

<p>The Electricity and Magnetism workshops
were given in two different sites during the summer of 1995 and,
in October, at three new sites:  an afterschool program at the
Beacon Independent School (IS) 8, another at a Saturday program
at IS 92, and the third at a homework helptutorial program at
Walton's Pond, a local community agency developed by Senator Walton.

<p>The
IS 8 group was very diverse, first through six graders.  We found
that Kelly's recommendation to try to work with a more homogeneous
group was a good one, but despite our difficulties with the age
range, the group did give a direct affirmation of how good, challenging,
and fun handson activities can be.

<p>At first the IS 8 group was
not at all enthusiastic about doing science.   They had been in
school all day and prior to my arriving were in a homework help
and tutoring class.  Did I mention that I began at 4:30?  &quot;Wow!
what a day,&quot; (this is what their facial expressions and body
language were communicating), &quot;and now science! You gotta
be nuts!!&quot;  Under these conditions especially, &quot;fun&quot;
is key to learning.  The simple project I introduced &#190; making
a miniature light bulb light with battery and wire &#190; fascinated
them and totally captured their attention.

<p>The goal of Reap &amp;
Keep's SMET workshops is to stimulate interest and awareness of
science, math, engineering and technology in the context of everyday
life.  What can be more stimulating than doing something and having
fun doing it? We try to involve our youth in &quot;doing&quot;
and &quot;exploring.&quot;  In our workshops, based upon discovery
and investigation, youth formulate their own questions and answers,
and engage in critical thinking and problem solving.   Reap &amp;
Keep has always been more concerned with what a child can do than
with what a child knows.   Although telecommunications was not
an integral part of the workshop content (in fact, the yoth didn't
use computers at all), the series could not have been developed
and implemented without the CTCNet telecommunications support,
so I see this as a real benefit of being in this network.

<p>The work
that we undertook with help from Kelly and CTCNet is continuing.
 By early March we hope to have developed more sets of thematic
materials, each consisting of eight workshop sessions.  All workshops
are handson and in the great majority of them, young people make
something that they can take home.  We expect to be reporting
on the SMET project at the CTCNet AllAffiliates Conference in
June, and will be happy to share our materials with any other
affiliates interested.  The themes are:

<p>SOUND  To investigate and
understand sound, youth make a loudspeaker, hearing aid, model
eardrum and vocal cords.  Grades 3-6.

<p>FOOD CHEMISTY  Using physical
and chemical tests, participants determine some of the major nutrients
found in eight familiar foods.  They test for starch, glucose,
fat and protein.  Grades 4-6.

<p>LIFE CYCLE OF BUTTERFLIES  Participants
observe how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly and learn how
transformation is a characteristic of living things.  Grades 2-4.

<p>LIGHT,
VISUAL OPTICS, KALEIDOSCOPE  Youth explore the properties of light,
its relationship to color, and learn to shape light.  Grades 3-6.

<p>GLOBE
KIT  Using an 8&quot; globe, students calculate Earth measurements,
solve astronomy problems, and investigate seismology.  Grades
4 and up.

<p>BALLOON PHYSICS  Balloon activities demonstrate gravity,
density, static electricity, propulsion, sound, friction and air
pressure.  Children use straws to make bridges, spaceships, vehicles.
 Grades K-4.

<p>TECHNOLOGY  Activities designed by the Children's Museum
of Boston use common materials for designing and building amazing
structures.  Children experience force, inertia, and gravity.
 Grades 5-8.

<p>LOGIC CIRCUITS  Logic circuits are built and embedded
in a range of toys.  Kids use materials such as aluminum foil,
batteries, and an LED (Light Emitted Diode).  Grades K-6.
