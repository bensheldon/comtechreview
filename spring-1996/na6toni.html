<h3>Discovering Learning in Solitaire</h3>
<P>
For many of us, there comes a time when we need a timepasser.
Games and puzzles are good for this. Games, the good ones anyway,
spark concentration and engagement. Developing strategies and
plotting moves require thinking, often so much thinking that there
is no room in our heads for more worrisome or scary thoughts about
our real lives. Learning to play a game, too, is more fun than
learning to do arithmetic, yet it calls forth the same sort of
analytic skills.
<P>
Still, I've always harbored private doubts about,
for example, a game like solitaire. I've seen people in computer
centers (and in offices) play it by the hour. &quot;This,&quot;
I think privately, &quot;is a time waster, not even a time passer.
Perhaps we ought to take this game off all the computers.&quot;

<P>A
recent experience in Greensboro, NC, has altered my thinking.
I was visiting for the first time the Triad Minority Development
Corporation (TMDC) affiliate. This impressive program is working
toward economic development for its community by giving young
people and adults the opportunity to develop computer skills that
will open up new ways of learning and new career paths.
<P>

It was
an informal occasion and, as I walked into the computer lab, I
noticed that one boy was playing solitaire. You can imagine the
thoughts that went through my head. I continued back in the lab
to where a kid of about three or four was struggling to get into
a chair in front of a computer, her mother standing anxiously
by. It turned out the kid wanted the solitaire game&#190;not that
she'd ever played it, but she wanted what she'd seen on the other
boy's screen. 

<P>
As kids will, she put her hand over the mouse and
started clicking. The game shrank, and almost disappeared. I helped
her find the corner of the game screen and guided her hand to
pull it back to full size. Well, she pulled it back and forth,
to large and then to small, again and again, but finally tired,
and then she started clicking on the card shapes on the screen.
Sometimes something happened, sometimes not. It didn't seem to
matter. She was all clicks.
<P>

&quot;Slow down,&quot; I suggested.
&quot;Try to figure out what's going on. What is the computer
doing when you click?&quot; She had a red eight. I suggested she
move it to a black nine. She did, and it stayed there. I cheered.
After trying to move virtually every other card on the screen
and with me asking &quot;Why did it stay there?&quot; or &quot;Why
didn't it stay?&quot; she eventually got the idea: numbers go
down, black goes on red or red on black. The big thrill came when
she found she could move a whole stack if only she could place
the cursor on the top card in the stack. That was a problem!

<P>
The
computer room closed before she could finish the game. On the
way out, her mother confided to me that she hadn't realized the
child even knew her numbers, much less had any understanding of
sequence. She'd been afraid the game would be way beyond the girl's
ability and would simply be a frustration. She was delighted!

<P>I,
on the other hand, was reflecting on lost opportunities. I had
thoroughly enjoyed working with this girl. She had shown me solitaire
as a vehicle for develping number recognition, sequencing skills,
and for strategizing, to say nothing of increasing handeye coordination
and acquiring computer manipulation skills. But I had missed the
chance to go back to the older boy who had also been playing the
game. Missed the chance to talk with him about his strategies,
about how he'd learned to play it, about how he was thinking;
missed the chance to find out what it was that intrigued him&#190;the
challenge, the passing of time, something else? And I was mindful
of all the similarly missed chances in my past and hopeful that
I would not let any future opportunities glide by me so easily.
<P>
Don't
misunderstand. I'm not advocating universal acceptance of endless
amounts of time spent by individuals playing solitaire on the
computer&#190;or any other game that seems, once learned, to demand
little in the way of skill or strategy. Rather, what I learned
in Greensboro is that it's important, before condemning such involvement
outofhand, to raise questions, to engage the player in human dialogue,
to make sure that solitaire, or any similar activity, is not a
solitary pursuit.
