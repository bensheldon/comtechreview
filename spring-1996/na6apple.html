<h2>CTCNet/Apple Partnership Leads Industry Collaborations</h2>
<P>


In partnership with CTCNet, Apple awarded
<a href="apple.html">a major equipment grant</a> in 1996 to 18 CTCNet 
member centers and, <a href="ap97pr.html">in 1997, Apple 
awarded equipment to 26 centers.</a>
They responded to a <a href="apple97.html">Request for 
Proposals</a> that was issued in December 1996. 

The basic award package in 1997 consisted of five Macintosh Performas
6400/180 with CD-ROMs and modems, LaserWriter, Apple ColorOne
Scanner, and QuickTake digital camera. Each computer came with
a variety of software, including ClarisWorks, an Internet
connection kit, Adobe PhotoDeluxe, the American Heritage
Children's Dictionary, and Click Art Performa Collection. CD-ROM
software titles included the Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia,
Amazing Writing Machine, 3D Atlas, etc.  

<p> In 1996, a similar package was awarded to 12 CTCNet
affiliates and partial packages to another six affiliates. CTCNet
Advisory Board members, EDC volunteers, and Apple Computer
employees reviewed the proposals. 

<P> According to Fred Silverman, Senior Manager for Apple's
Worldwide Community Affairs,

<P> &quot;Apple Computer is pleased to partner with CTCNet in
Expanding Technology Access. This effort builds on our
long-standing commitment to provide Apple technology to
community-based organizations through our grants programs.&quot; 

<P> Apple Computer has supported groups like CTCNet over the
years and, in fact, previously awarded systems to six affiliates.
&quot;Expanding Technology Access,&quot; is &quot;a natural
extension of this commitment.&quot; In a letter to CTCNet
affiliates, Silverman wrote, &quot;Since CTCNet exists to support
groups like yours in enabling people to use and benefit from
computer technology, we feel that by partnering with this
organization, our donations will be enhanced both by its mission
and by its expertise.&quot; 

<!--In related developments, donated site licensing agreements
have been arranged through the Lotus Philanthropy Program;
substantial software donations from Tom Snyder/TorStar through
Peter Elarde and Lisa Heaney; Microsoft CD's through Debra
Pollard at Microsoft and Karen Thomson of the Children's Defense
Fund.-->
