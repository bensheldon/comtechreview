<h1>Public Utility Commissions and Sustainable Funding
for Community Technology</h1> <font size=+2><i>by Ellis Jacobs</i></font><p>

While attention has been focused on legislative developments
in Washington, much of the future of telecommunications and how
that future will impact low income people is being worked out
right now in proceedings in front of state public utility commissions.
<P>
Those proceedings, which involve existing phone companies
seeking to change the way they have historically been regulated
and new competitors submitting to state regulation for the first
time, provide an opportunity for low income advocates to address
both lack of access to basic phone service and lack of access
to computer and telecommunications technology and related educational
opportunities.[1]<BR>

<h2>
The Problem
</h2>
Lack of a telephone is common problem for American
low income families.
<P>
While 94% of all American households have a phone,
31% of all families receiving food stamps have no telephone and
43.5 of households completely dependant on public assistance lack
telephones.[2] African American and Hispanic households are more
than three times as likely as white households to not have phones.[3]
In households headed by women in any of these categories, the
likelihood of not having a telephone is even greater.[4]
<P>
Not having a telephone poses significant problems.
It creates a barrier to getting timely medical attention and makes
it difficult to report other emergencies such as fire or crime.
One study has shown that the inability to contact agencies by
phone is one important factor in keeping people from getting benefits
for which they qualified. It is a barrier to employment: jobs
are frequently offered and accepted via telephone.[5]
<P>
It has a serious impact on the ability of a household
to keep gas and electric service. Lack of phone service makes
it more difficult for a household to enter into utility payment
plans, make contact with social service agencies and otherwise
respond to an impending shut-off. One study conducted by the National
Consumer Law Center for the Maine Public Utilities Commission
showed that 80% of disconnected households had no telephone and
that people without a phone were under-represented in utility
payment plans.
<P>
Today phone lines are used for far more than just
voice communications. Phone lines make possible data transmission,
computer networking and the use of the developing &quot;information
superhighway.&quot;
<P>
Many jobs in the future will call for people who
are well educated in the use of telecommunications and computer
technology. Already a working person who is able to use a computer
earns 10-15% more than someone in a similar job who cannot.[6]
Computer networks offer their users access to communities of people
who share interests, make possible communication around the globe
and already provide access to much of the world's information
resources. Public data is becoming available on line and the expectation
of access has taken root. Those with access have a distinct and
growing advantage. Those without access will fall behind. 
<P>
Obviously, the many low income families without phones
are missing out on these developments but the problem extends
to those with phones as well.
<P>
According to 1993 census data the wealthier the family,
the more likely it is to own a computer. 74% of families making
over $75,000 own at least one. By contrast only 15% of families
with incomes under $20,000 own a computer. The census revealed
a racial disparity as well. White families are three times as
likely as African American or hispanic families to have a computer.
<P>
As computer networking becomes more prevalent, the
division of society into information haves and have nots looms
very large.<BR>

<h2>
An Opportunity - The Ohio Ameritech Case</h2>
During much of 1993 and 1994, the Legal Aid
Society of Dayton and Cleveland, Ohio represented clients in a
case in front of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO).
That case provided the opportunity to address many of these issues.
The result of that case includes some important steps forward
for low income communities and points to opportunities for low
income advocates.
<P>
On March 23, 1993, Ameritech Ohio (The Ohio Bell
Telephone Company) began the process of seeking alternative regulation
from the PUCO. On April 6, 1993 the Office of Consumers' Counsel,
the statutory legal representative of Ameritech Ohio's residential
customers, filed a complaint against Ameritech alleging that their
current rates were unjust and unreasonable and should be reduced
to a just and reasonable level. By entry dated September 2, 1993,
the PUCO consolidated the two cases for purposes of hearing. 
<P>
Twenty-five parties filed for and were granted intervention
in both of these cases. The intervenors included long distance
carriers, cable operators, other telecommunication providers and
a variety of entities representing consumer interest. The consumer
parties included the American Association of Retired Persons,
the Greater Cleveland Welfare Rights Organization, the Edgemont
Neighborhood Coalition of Dayton, the Cities of Cleveland, Columbus,
and Toledo, and the Ohio Departments of Education and of Administrative
Services. These groups coalesced during the course of the case
into the &quot;Consumers' Coalition.&quot;
<P>
Ameritech's application for alternative regulation
was part of the company's effort to change the way it was regulated
in the State of Ohio. Previously Ameritech, like most utilities,
was subject to &quot;rate of return&quot; regulation. The rate
of return regulation examines the cost of providing service, the
amount of investment, the fair rate of return in comparative settings,
and sets rates based upon those factors. Ameritech was seeking
the alternative of &quot;price cap&quot; regulation which commits
the company to providing services at certain set rates but eliminates
all regulation of the amount of profit the company is making.
Ameritech, along with just about every other player in the telecommunications
field, wanted to enter new areas of service provision and claimed
that Alternative Regulation was a prerequisite to being able to
do that. 
<P>
The Ameritech case took place within an evolving
regulatory context which provides that the PUCO can grant Alternative
Regulation where it finds that it would be &quot;in the public
interest.&quot;[7]
<P>
In rules adopted by the PUCO in 1993 an applicant
for Alternative Regulation is required to show that the proposed
plan is in the public interest. They need to show, among other
things, &quot;how the plan might impact the goal of universal
service...&quot; Each Alternative Regulation proposal must also
include &quot;commitments,&quot; expenditures beyond what is needed
to meet minimum service standards. The company must demonstrate
how those commitments are consistent with the policy goals of
the Ohio Revised Codes.[8]
<P>
Ameritech's application included a number of commitments
to make general infrastructure improvements and it including a
commitment to create a broad band interactive network connecting
Ohio's schools. The company widely promoted this educational commitment
as their primary way of trying to win public support for their
proposal.
<P>
On March 25, 1994 the staff of the PUCO filed its
staff report of investigation which concluded that indeed the
company had been overcharging its customers and the &quot;commitments&quot;
made by Ameritech in its Alternative Regulation application were
not sufficient to justify the regulatory relief Ameritech was
seeking. Staff reports are not dispositive of any issues but do
provide a look at where the Commission might end up with a case.
<P>
It was in this context that almost three months of
evidentiary hearings on the consolidated case commenced on June
22, 1994. Through the cross examination of Ameritech's witnesses
and through presenting their own witnesses, the Consumer Coalition
developed a record showing, among other things, that Ameritech
had been overcharging its customers, that the company's education
commitments were hollow and somewhat illusory, and that the existing
low income telephone program was ineffective leaving a great many
low income Ohioans without phones.
<P>
Ameritech had claimed that its educational network
would lessen the inequality between wealthy and poor school districts.
The evidence at hearing showed that the equipment each school
would have to provide to connect to the network would cost between
$35,000 and $50,000 per classroom. There was testimony that because
of these cost barriers it was likely that only wealthy school
districts would take advantage of this new technology. The effect
would be to increase rather than decrease the disparity in educational
opportunity between wealthy and poor school districts. 
<P>
In addition, cross examination established that,
where students did have access to computers and networks at school,
those students who also had access to similar technology at home
would derive far more benefit than students who didn't have after
school access.
<P>
Further, an expert witness sponsored by low income
advocates, Nancy Brockway from the National Consumer Law Center[9],
also testified that access to and knowledge about computer networks
was becoming more and more important to participation in the economic
and political life of the country and that low income communities
had virtually no access to those networks. Without some affirmative
corrective action, she testified, it was likely that the proliferation
of this technology would reinforce and exacerbate existing economic
and racial inequality. 
<P>
With regard to basic phone access the evidence showed
that service for low income people was far from &quot;universal&quot;
and that the existing low income telephone programs with their
very limited eligibility and benefits were not helping to correct
the problem in any meaningful way.<BR>

<h2>
The Agreement
</h2>
While the evidentiary hearings were going on, Ameritech
and the Consumer Coalition began to negotiate in earnest. The
Consumer Coalition was able to fashion a joint negotiating position
and strategy. The Edgemont Neighborhood Coalition pressed for
community computer centers and the education technology fund.
Other Coalition members pushed other issues. The Consumer Coalition's
position included funds for low-income community computer centers
as well as the school technology fund, general rate reductions
for all residential customers, and the establishment of a Universal
Service Assistant (USA) program which would allow low income people
to get reduced rate phone service without having to pay a deposit
and connection charge. The Consumer Coalition stayed together
throughout the negotiations and continued to support these positions,
all of which ended up in the final agreement with Ameritech. The
staff of the PUCO also joined the negotiations and ended up signing
the agreement.
<h2>
Another Step Towards Universal Telephone Service
</h2>
The Universal Service Assistance program has broad
eligibility. Recipients of HEAP, Ohio Energy Credits, AFDC, SSI
(Blind, Disabled &amp; Aged) General Assistance, Disability Assistance,
and/or Medicaid will be eligible for USA. Approximately 100,000
households which do not presently have a telephone will receive
new benefits.
<P>
Benefits include a $8 per month discount from standard
prices with free touch tone so that monthly rates will be reduced
(flat rate to $10.87; minute line to $2.32). Non-flat rate customers
will be capped at the flat rate for the first six months and be
able to switch to flat rate at anytime for free. No deposit is
required. No service connection is charged. Free toll restriction
and 900 &amp; 976 blocking are available if requested. The company
must enter into arrearage payment arrangements with those who
have been or who are in danger of being disconnected.

<h2>
Internet and Technology Access

</h2>
Low income high technology needs are addressed in
two ways. 
<P>
The settlement provides for 14 Community Computer
Centers to be created in seven Ohio cities in the Ameritech service
territory: Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo, Akron, Youngstown,
and Marietta. Each center will receive $150,000 over three years
for staff and equipment. The total expenditure on centers will
be $2.2 million. 
<P>
Community Computer Centers are designed to make computer
technology and networks available in low income neighborhoods.
The centers will generally be located in storefronts. They will
bring together hardware, software and network access in a tutorial,
workshop, and drop-in atmosphere; they will be staffed by experts
and volunteers in community outreach and computer technology;
they will be open in the evening.
<P>
In this respect the result of this Ameritech Alternative
Regulation case is precedent setting. This is the first time that
Community Computer Centers have been included in the settlement
of a case in front of a state public utility commission.
<P>
An 18 million dollar school technology fund was also
established, to be administered by the State Department of Education.
Low income school districts are given a preference in accessing
these funds which can be used to purchase &quot;consumer premises
equipment&quot; for use with computer and distance learning networks.


<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
It was a combination of factors which made the settlement
possible:
<OL>
<LI>the leverage which came from a case showing excess profit
by Ameritech and a PUCO staff report which supported that position
and which alleged that the company's commitments were insufficient,

<LI>state regulations which use &quot;the public interest&quot;
and &quot;universal service&quot; as touchstones, 
<LI>an evidentiary record which supported the need for computer
centers and an education fund in order for alternative regulation
to be in the public interest and which supported further efforts
at overcoming affordability barriers to having a phone, 
<LI>a developing competitive environment where Ameritech and several
other large companies were competing for pieces of an expanding
telecommunications pie, 
<LI>a low income position that had a realistic price tag and,

<LI>a consumer coalition which included low income interests,
attempted to address the needs of all its members, and stuck together
in negotiating with the Company.
</OL>

<P>
On November 23, 1994 the PUCO approved the settlement
because the parties represented a broad spectrum of interests,
because the concerns of its staff were satisfied in the agreement,
and because the record developed in the hearing supported the
settlement terms.
<P>
Throughout the country other &quot;baby bells&quot;
will be seeking regulatory relief from public utility commissions.
Each such case will present the opportunity to raise many of the
issues raised in the Ameritech Ohio case. In addition, cable and
long distance companies want to begin providing local phone service
in competition with the existing phone companies. These would-be
competitors will be seeking the blessing of state regulators and
there will be opportunities to further low income interests in
those proceedings as well. <BR>

<LI>Ohio Rev. Code 4927.04. In 1989 the State of Ohio adopted
a new chapter of the Ohio Revised Code which provided for Alternative
Regulation of telecommunications companies under certain circumstances.
That chapter established that it was the telecommunications policy
of the state to: 1) ensure the availability of adequate basic
local exchange service to citizens throughout the state; 2) maintain
just and reasonable rates, rentals, tolls and charges for public
telecommunications service; 3) encourage innovation in the telecommunications
industry; 4) promote diversity and options in the supply of public
telecommunications services and equipment throughout this state;
and 5) recognize the continuing emergence of a competitive telecommunications
environment through flexible regulatory treatment of public telecommunications
services where appropriate.

isn't just an Ohio policy. The Communication Act of 1934, which
created the Federal Communication Commission, proclaimed that
the goal of telecommunication regulation was: &quot; . . . to
make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United
States, a rapid, efficient, nationwide and worldwide. . . communication
service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges. . . for
the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the
use of . . . communications.&quot; 47 U.S.C. Section 151.
