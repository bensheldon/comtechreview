<h3>Report on NTIA's "Falling Through the Net"</h3>
You won't read Falling Through the Net: A Survey of the &quot;Have
Nots&quot; in Rural and Urban America for its prose.  But you
will want to keep it on hand for its reference value.  Falling
Through the Net, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce
in July 1995, is a collection of statistics recounting the discouraging
numbers of who does - and who doesn't - have access to computer
technology and the Internet.

<p>For those working in community computing,
it provides valuable information needed to make the case that
the technology gap exists. It also recognizes the role community
access centers need to play in addressing the information and
technology gap.

<p>The principal source for the statistics is the
Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS).  Responses were
crosstabulated in the areas of income, race, age, education and
region, and by three geographic categories&#190;rural, urban and
center city.  The questions included looking at the percent of
U.S. households with a telephone, with a computer, with a computer
and a modem, and using online services.

<p>The survey numbers support
what many already know:  that information havenots are disproportionately
found in our country's rural areas and central cities.  Income
is a clear indicator as to whether a household has a computer.
 7.6% of central city residents and 4.5% of rural residents with
a household income of less than $10,000 have computers.  Almost
twothirds of all households earning $75,000 annually have computers.
 Other findings include:

&#183; 
<ul>
<li>On the basis of race, black households
in central cities and rural areas have the lowest percentage of
computers in the home. Asian and white households have the highest.&#183;
On the basis of age, the youngest and most senior households are
least likely to have computers in the home, especially those living
in rural areas.

<li>In general, the fewer the years of education,
the lower the telephone, computer and computermodem household
penetration.

<li>Many of the groups least likely to have computers
and modems at home are as enthusiastic about using online services
as others when technology is there.  

<p>The findings here will help
identify those who should be targeted in policies designed to
narrow the information gap.  The report also identifies the &quot;pivotal
role to be assumed in the new electronic age by the traditional
providers of information access for the general public
the
public schools, and libraries... and other community access centers...&quot;
