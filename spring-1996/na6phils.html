<h3>On the Capital Children's Museum's Web Pages</h3>
In my free time I do some volunteering at the Capital Children's
Museum in Washington, DC.  This particular children's museum happens
to be much more than a museum.  It takes seriously its mission
to celebrate human culture and creative expression.  It excels
at helping young minds awaken to the wonders of the world.  It
supports programs to involve youth actively in creative projects
including the creation of video documentaries.  Teens have access
to a full video production facility.  They plan, shoot and edit
their own documentaries &#190; sometime even adding their own
computer generated animations. 

<P>To help you picture the Capital
Children's Museum, imagine a huge three storey red brick structure
with dozens of exhibit rooms and oodles of nooks and cranies.
 Soon after the doors open each moring the sound of children's
laughter and giggling fills the air.  Almost all the exhibits
include discovery based learning activities. 

<P>And now this museum
is going on the World Wide Web.  What will result?  

<P>In some respects,
a web page is an ongoing, evergrowing newsletter.  Announcements
of events and happenings can be disseminated.  Solicitations for
volunteer help can be posted.  If the museum needs specific expertise,
say with a project involving desktop publishing, the web page
can contain an appeal for such help.  Chances are good that some
kind soul in the greater metropolitan community will step forward.
 Even better, the museum can express publicly its appreciation
of volunteers &#190; right on the web &#190; for all to see. 

<P>For
families and schools in the metro area, the museum's web page
is sure to be a treasure.  People will be able to plan their visits
to the various exhibits at the museum, whetting children's appetites
even before they arrive. 

<P>Do you think local businesses might take
a greater interest in supporting the museum if they can see their
names listed on the museum's web page.  I suspect they might.

<P>
The most important potential of the web site to me, though, is
that the museum can now exhibit the creative work of local youth
to a worldwide audience.  It would not be at all difficult for
school art teachers to submit the best of their students' graphic
work or music teachers of students' compositions.  The museum's
web page can add to its own brick building limitless wall space
celebrating the creative spirit of the city's youth. 

<P>To be sure,
it's a bit scary to contemplate how much incoming email this web
page might generate.  The museum's staff already put in long hours.
 Answering 3040 email messages per day is no small additional
task, and the volume could easily grow to 8090 messages per day
within just a few months. 

<P>I admire the leadership of the museum
for their foresight and courage.  The very existence of a home
page will let the metropolitan community know that the museum
is comfortable extending its presence into cyberspace.  And the
page will be an implicit invitiation to support the mission of
the Children's Museum.  

<P>The social ramifications of having a museum
on the web are just beginning to be understood.  I'm quite sure
that many positive things will be happening soon.  The musum's
original mission, which it has succeeded so well in fulfilling
thus far, is going to explode into a whole new dimension.
