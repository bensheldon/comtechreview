CTCNet Mission Statement
</FONT></B><br>
<P>
Community Technology Centers' Network (CTCNet) envisions a 
society in which all people are equitably empowered by 
technology skills and usage. CTCNet is committed to achieving 
this end.
<P>
CTCNet shares with Playing To Win, its founding organization, a 
recognition that, in an increasingly technologically dominated 
society, people who are socially and/or economically 
disadvantaged will become further disadvantaged if they lack 
access to computers and computer-related technologies.
<P>
CTCNet brings together agencies and programs that provide 
opportunities whereby people of all ages who typically lack 
access to computers and related technologies can learn to use 
these technologies in an environment that encourages exploration 
and discovery and, through this experience, develop personal 
skills and self-confidence.
<P>
CTCNet offers resources to enhance each affiliated 
agency/program's capacity to provide technology access and 
education to its constituency and to help and nurture other 
like-minded programs in its area. CTCNet will facilitate 
telecommunications, print, and in-person linkages enabling 
members to benefit from shared experience and expertise.
<P>
CTCNet will be a leading advocate of equitable access to 
computers and related technologies; it will invite, initiate, 
and actively encourage partnerships and collaborations with 
other individuals and organizations that offer resources in 
support of its mission; and it will strive, in every arena, to 
bring about universal technological enfranchisement.
