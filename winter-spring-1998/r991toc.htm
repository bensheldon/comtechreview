We want to invite your contributions for this 
collaborative publication on "Communications Policy on the Front 
Lines: Ideas for Change."<P> <blockquote>
Why do Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) need to be engaged 
in the contest over communications policy? The short answer is 
that this contest will determine who gets the resources and who 
does not. There is an old saying that the burden of a compromise 
is borne by the party who was not at the table. 
<p>
Community Based Organizations represent a powerful alternative 
vision for the digital age. Yours is a vision that focuses on 
serving the real needs of ordinary people, and it is expressed 
in a thousand practical ways... In church basements and 
recreational centers and AIDs clinics, CBOs offer a real bridge 
to the 21st Century for the have-nots and even the 
have-a-little's. This work deserves support, as much as the work 
of libraries and schools and rural health care facilities.
<p> 
Community Based Organizations have a powerful vision and an 
important practical approach to technology, but your political 
power is only an enormous potential. This potential exists not 
because of the amount of money you can devote to lobbying, but 
because you can reach out and touch and motivate hundreds of 
thousands of real people. You can show them what communications 
technology can do to improve their lives. You can make the 
promise of the digital age real. To awaken this political power, 
you must begin to articulate a set of policies, and organize 
support around them. You might be surprised how many friends you 
have in high places willing to take up your cause. <p>
-- from "Community-Based Organizations and the Contest Over 
Communications Policy," Mark Lloyd, Executive Director, Civil 
Rights Forum on Communications Policy 
(<a href="http://www.civilrightsforum.org/cbocontest.htm">http://www.civilrightsforum.org/cbocontest.htm</a>)
</blockquote>
<p>
Mark Lloyd's challenge is an opportunity to marshall our forces 
and move forward together.  The upcoming joint issue of <i>The CTC 
Review</i> and the AFCN newsletter--with contributions from local 
projects and some of the other major associations of grassroots 
community technology projects and resource organizations--gives us 
a triple opportunity:
<ul>
<li> to hear stories about grassroots organizations grappling 
with policy in their community media work;
<li> to present and learn about the specific policy 
preoccupations and issues of major national community technology 
organizations in a context that brings us all together and tries 
to provide some common voice;
<li> to see the range of policy support resources we have to 
work with.
</ul>
We're planning to publish the hard copy issue in May, to be 
supplemented with a more extensive online version.  We welcome 
your contributions--both stories from the field and, from 
appropriate sources, financial contributions to help us 
distribute our work as widely as possible.  Contact us, too, if 
you'd like to arrange for getting bulk quantities of this special issue.
We look forward to hearing from you and spreading the word.
