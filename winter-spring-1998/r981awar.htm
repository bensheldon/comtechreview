     The Computer Clubhouse at the Computer Museum in Boston has won 
     the 1997 Peter Drucker Award for Nonprofit Innovation. The Award 
     is given each year to an innovative program that has made a 
     difference in the lives of the people it serves, has measurable 
     outcomes, and serves as a model that can be replicated by others. 
     The Award was named for and inspired by Peter Drucker, the 
     renowned management authority, and is highly competitive. In 
     addition to presenting the Award, the Foundation will produce a 
     10-minute video about the Clubhouse, featuring the stories of 
     some of the Clubhouse youth whose lives have been changed by the
     Clubhouse.

as 1997 Awardee of<br>
Innovative Initiative Award<br></FONT></B><P>
     </center>
<p>
Josh Merrow was the 1997 winner of the
CTCNet Innovative Initiative Award, which is accompanied by $1,000 from a trust
established by Tim Barclay. The following are extracts from Josh's nomination:
Josh "has endeavored to make the center accessible not only to the El Puente students, but also to the 
wider community.<p>
In terms of the high school, Josh has made the center much more popular with students with programs like 
a UNIX programming club, 
a student-run after-school website design business, and forums on fun things like image manipulation and 
graphic design.<p>

"The focus of most of Josh's work is that to make technology useful, one has to look at it critically and 
determine how to use it as a tool. 
This requires that one question the claims made by manufacturers that their technology makes one's life 
better by virtue of itself.
<p>
"In terms of his outreach to the community, Josh has built bridges benefiting not only the technology 
center but the entire
El Puente organization. As a result of his vision, creativity, and unbounded energy he has expanded the 
services of the center 
to reach people of all ages and backgrounds, and enabled El Puente to meet diverse and urgent local needs 
- 
from career training, to creative arts, to community organizing..."
