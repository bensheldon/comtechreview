During the summer, the CTCNet Research and Evaluation Team conducted
a small community mapping or, as we decided to call it, resource
mapping project in the Boston area. Executed by our summer fellow,
Elizabeth Goodsell, the project resulted in the report, <I>Forging
Links for Community Building: A Guide to Resource Mapping for
CTCNet Affiliates. </I>(To obtain a hard copy or the electronic
version of the full report, see details below.
<P>
The purposes of the project were to:
<UL>
<LI>introduce the concept of resource mapping to affiliates; 
<LI>try out the process of resource mapping for technology access
at two affiliates in the Boston area; 
<LI>assess the benefits or resource mapping, based on the information
gathered and reflections on the process; and, 
<LI>provide a process for affiliates who want to conduct their
own mapping projects. 
</UL>

<P>
This report is just the beginning of the Research and Evaluation
Team's work with community mapping. As work in this area continues,
watch for other reports and an eventual &quot;how-to&quot;
manual for community mapping that will expand on the tips 
given in the CTCNet 
<a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/toc.htm"><I>Center Start-Up Manual</I></a>.
<P>
Resource, or community, mapping is a way to think about communities
and community development. Most community-based organizations
conduct needs assessments in the areas where they work. These
approaches highlight what communities lack and the problems they
face. Communities then are seen as needing &quot;help&quot;
or to be &quot;fixed,&quot; often by an outside agent. <I>Alternately,
resource mapping focuses on what communities have to offer by
identifying their existing assets and resources that can be used
for building communities<B>. </B></I>The process is outlined very
well in <I>Building Communities from the Inside Out: A Path Toward
Finding and Mobilizing a Community's Assets </I>by John
Kretzmann and John McKnight. They call this approach &quot;capacity-focused
development.&quot; (p. 5)
<P>
To do a resource mapping study, organizations complete a &quot;capacity
inventory&quot; (p. 16) to assess the potential of citizens,
organizations and associations, and to help &quot;capture local
institutions for community building&quot; (p. 171). The inventory
collects data through a series of brief questions. It can be used
in a one-on-one interview or a group setting, or can be designed
as a survey for individuals to complete on their own. When completed,
the inventory is used to create a picture, or <I><B>map</B></I>,
of the capacities or assets existing in the community. 
<P>
The word &quot;community&quot; can mean different things to
different people. It can be defined using geographic, cultural
or economic terms. For a resource mapping study, in addition to
being known as a geographic area, &quot;community&quot; is
best defined by including citizens, as well as informal organizations
of people, such as neighborhood associations and local institutions
like schools and libraries.
<P>
The assets these groups can provide include knowledge, skills,
personal and professional relationships and more traditional donations
of money, time and supplies. 
<P>
Resource mapping is most useful when used to facilitate community
action from inside the community. As Kretzmann and McKnight point
out, community resources should not be collected just for the
sake of study by outsiders, but must be matched or linked for
real community development. For example, a CTCNet affiliate may
undertake a resource mapping process and discover that they have
many links to pre-school programs. The affiliate may then decide
to work with a local pre-school to provide computing time for
youngsters who normally wouldn't have access to the technology.

<B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#000080>Potential Benefits of Resource Mapping</FONT></B>
<P>
Most of us use maps frequently. Road maps help us with geography;
site maps help us navigate web sites. Resource mapping, if focused
on an organization's links to others, results in a comprehensive
picture of how the organization interacts with its community.
<P>
This picture, or <B>resource map</B>, can be useful to affiliates
and other community-based organizations by:
<UL>
<LI>mining the valuable information on community links from people's
heads so that it can be displayed to all staff, volunteers, visitors
and board members. 
<LI>allowing staff and others to see potential new links within
groups in their existing network which can help program development;

<LI>helping an organization think about its interactions with
other community-based organizations and how to capitalize on those
relationships;
<LI>supplying a way to find new sources for volunteers, board
members or referrals to programs; 
<LI>being combined with other data, such as housing information
and a geographic map of your area from a commercial GIS program,
to give a comprehensive picture of the community;
<LI>providing insight into the organization's goals, projects
and structure for strategic planning purposes;
<LI>orienting new staff to the center's relationship with
the community; 
<LI>providing a visual representation of the community context
of your work, and;
<LI>supplying the means to create a resource database for you
center, as suggested in the <I>CTCNet Start-Up Manual</I>.
</UL>

<P>
Surely there are other beneficial ways to use the resource maps;
CTCNet affiliates may have more to add to the list, depending
upon their perspectives in communities.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#000080>The Process:</FONT></B>
<P>
Based on our experience, here's how to get started. 
<P>
First, define the <B>purpose</B> of the study. This is a critical
step in the resource mapping process. <I>What do you want to map
and how do you want to do it? What do you want to get out of the
process and the map?</I>
<P>
Next, you should define the scope of the project. This is another
important step in order to keep the research manageable and to
ensure that the study will be completed. The project can be as
large or as small as you need. For example, do you want to map
resources only for technology access or for any community development
activity? Do you want to map only your immediate geographic community
or your entire city? Also, think about whether you want this to
be an exhaustive study listing every current link or just enough
so you get a general idea of what links exist. 
<P>
Data from the interviews accumulates quickly. The scope should
take into account the staff and other resources you can dedicate
to the project.
<P>
Although it is helpful to have someone with a research background
conduct the study, it is not necessary. The critical skills are
communication for interviewing and analytical skills for developing
the maps. A person who is familiar with the community and has
relationships with some of the existing partners may have an easier
time collecting data and therefore will reduce the amount of time
needed for the project. An outsider will need time to understand
the community and build trust with the interview subjects. Paid
staff, volunteers, or interns from a nearby college or high school
can conduct (with appropriate guidance) a resource mapping study.
<P>
The most useful informational will be gleaned from interviews
with staff, volunteers, board members, visitors, local businesses
and organizations, collaborators/partners and funders. Depending
on your needs this list should be reduced or expanded.
<P>
Questions for the interviews should be tailored to the types of
people with whom you are speaking. Examples of the interview questions
used in this study can be found as appendices to the report. Feel
free to use/modify these tools as appropriate for your needs.
Field notes are another useful tool for resource mapping. Essentially,
field notes are a log of activities, impressions, and observations
taken during the course of the study. Information from field notes
can be analyzed and included in the final product and actions
taken as a result of the resource map. Field notes should include
transcripts of interviews with subjects.
<P>
At any time during the information gathering process, the actual
resource map can be started. Simply start by putting the affiliate
in the center of a blank page, and then begin to add links to
information about the assets a community has to offer. More than
one map may be necessary to get an understanding of all the information
gathered. Our study was limited to mapping links to organizations,
not individual assets, and was organized by type of institution.
For example, we categorized groups as: community-based organizations/nonprofits,
individuals, business, government, schools/universities and associations.
The use of color and different types of lines may also help with
this process.
<P>
After you've successfully mapped your resources, how should
you use the map? <I>The power of resource mapping comes with what
happens after the resources have been identified. </I>As Kretzmann
and McKnight point out, the information gained by resource mapping
should not be collected as an end in itself; it should be used
to create new partnerships for community building. How you use
the information to benefit your center will differ depending upon
the purpose of your study, and your perspective. <BR>

<U><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#000080>2. GIS Software</FONT></B></U>
<P>
At the June 1997 CTCNet All-Affiliates Conference, Susan Aceti
from the Coalition for Low-Income Community Development demonstrated
new desktop GIS software, called <I>Community 2020</I>. The Federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is developing
this GIS software and exploring its use by community organizations.
This software allows a user to select a geographic area and then
retrieve data such as HUD programs, census tracts and block groups,
empowerment zones and enterprise communities and detailed census
demographic information. The Coalition for Low-Income Community
Development is drafting a &quot;citizens manual&quot; to accompany
the <I>Community 2020 </I>software.
<P>
<I>Community 2020</I> requires a 486 PC or higher (Pentium, etc.);
Windows 3.1 or higher; minimum of 12 MB RAM; minimum of 16MB of
free space on the hard drive and a CD-ROM drive. The Coalition
for Low-Income Community Development is working with HUD on a
&quot;citizen manual&quot; to help community groups learn how
to use Community 2020 software in their work. The basic software
package will be sold for $249.00. Call Community Connections at
1-800-998-9999 and ask for the Order Desk. 
<P>
A listserv exists to provide a discussion on all aspects of GIS
use by communities. The forum is sponsored by Project SCOPE Inc.,
a Boston-based nonprofit public service organization, and is intended
to serve the needs of community-based organizations, GIS users
and supporters of GIS in the community. To subscribe: send an
e-mail message to majordomo@igc.org with the words &quot;subscribe
ppgis-scope&quot; in the message area. Leave the subject line
blank, and don't include the quotes around the words.
<P>
Also available are many, many GIS web sites showing all different
kinds of information. The U.S. Geological Survey at the Department
of the Interior has one site that provides information on how
they have used GIS software. The URL is: http://www.usgs.gov/research/gis/title.html.
