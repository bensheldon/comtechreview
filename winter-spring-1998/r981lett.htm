<b>Making Use of the CTCNet Evaluation Report</b>
<p>
Hi CTCNet,
<p>
We received our order of 15 copies of "Community Technology 
Centers: Impacts on Individuals and Their Communities."  The 
copies are very popular and I am going to need to order some 
more, if possible. The first batch I am using (starting 
tomorrow) with settlement house program staff who will be 
learning ways to access the impact of their technology programs. 
The new batch I would like to order (10) I want to give to the 
executive directors of the settlement houses which run the 
family room technology programs. The purpose is to educate them 
on a broad scale as to what community technology centers are 
doing, their potential, their impact to date and the importance 
of supporting them.
<p>
I would therefore like to order an additional 10 copies of the 
study. I am having a meeting of those executive directors next 
week and figured the meeting would be a good opportunity to get 
it into their hands.
<p>
Thanks for everything. I hope the New England fall season is 
treating you well.
<p>

<b>Sharing Networks for the People</b>
<p>
In the Spring of 1996, Peter Miller called the Loka Institue to
ask about our Community Research Network.  He suggested Loka and 
CTCNet learn from each other and share our experiences building 
networks.  This seemed like a good idea at the time.  I didn't 
realize just how good an idea until I attended the 1997 CTCNet 
All Affiliates Conference in Pittsburgh.  A cause one believes 
in is certainly a strong motive for building a network.  

<p>However, networking for the people involved in addition to the 
cause, makes the entire process more meaningful as well as more enjoyable.
Similar to CTCNet, the Community Research Network (CRN) is based
on the understanding that human interaction is a crucial element 
of sustainable community.  The community center&s#8212;revolving 
around technology, research or books&#8212;all have people at the 
core who bring warmth to the center and life to the 
information.  In subsequent conversations to our initial 
conversation last spring, CTCNet and the CRN have explored ways 
that our networks might more actively collaborate.

<p>The CRN's premise is that communities need information and support
to solve social and environmental problems. Complementary to 
CTCNet's mission to provide access to technology for use by 
communities, the CRN is providing access to good science for communities.
In the United States the public does not have access to research
to answer fundamental public questions regarding community 
health, economic viability, environmental quality, and social 
well-being.  Access to information that may be useful in solving 
community problems is largely produced, stored and organized in 
ways that favor exclusionary corporate, military and academic 
interests.  As a result, the nation's research agenda is 
controlled by these interests--not by the public.  Consequently 
the public--and even some governmental organizations--have 
little or no direct access to researchers or problem-solving 
strategies.  Even though the public pays for a large part of the 
science, the public have little say about what is studied and 
bear the brunt of corporatized science without receiving much benefit.
Many of the problems faced by municipalities, non-profit
organizations and communities, need solutions which science can 
provide. Government agencies need support to develop 
information, knowledge and wisdom to address social, 
environmental, economic and political problems. The public needs 
more access to information, and research capacity that responds 
to their needs and enables them to participate in decisions 
affecting their lives.
<p>
The mission of the CRN is to create a system of public interest
science that enables the public to establish the agenda, control 
the results, receive the benefits of research and find solutions 
to social and environmental problems through science.  The CRN 
is modeled after a 25-year-old Dutch network of 50 
university-based "Science Shops" which are dedicated to serving 
the public interest by answering the questions of community 
organizations, public interest groups, workers and local 
governments.  CRN affiliates in the U.S. have established models 
for researchers to share their expertise and collaborate with 
community members to identify community needs, design and 
conduct research, and use information to strengthen the 
community. 
<p>
A public interest scientist can help communities overcome major
obstacles: define the problem they face, define the information 
needed to address this problem, achieve a working knowledge of a 
complex issue, and gather and analyze information.  In cases 
where existing knowledge is limited, the researcher and 
community can work together to design and implement a research 
project that will gather data relevant to the problem.  Finally, 
collaborative efforts are an efficient way to plan an 
appropriate course of action that will address the problem once 
their results are attained.
<p>
Members of the CRN have identified ways in which the CRN will:
<p>
Strengthen the efficacy of over 40 nonprofit and publicly-funded 
community research centers and programs in the U.S.;
<p>
Increase the number of community research centers in the U.S. and
the commitment of publicly-funded and nonprofit science 
institutions (universities, national labs, grassroots 
organizations) to participate in public interest science;
<p>
Identify grassroots community organizations in need of information
and research to address problems in their communities, and link 
them with researchers and centers who will respond to their needs;
<p>
Facilitate translocal/transnational research collaboration.
<p>
In working toward these goals, members of the network will make
referrals and exchange information, as well as receive 
inspiration from colleagues doing similar work throughout the 
country.  Components of this short term goal include:  building 
existing community researchers' understanding of how they can 
work together through the CRN to offer significant research 
capacity to public interest causes; encouraging researchers to 
participate in the CRN and shape its goals, thus making the CRN 
their organization; strengthening the efficacy of individual 
centers and programs (e.g., by helping them learn from one and 
other); building their visibility, accessibility and legitimacy; 
developing a systematic network capacity for the CRN to document 
and evaluate network performance; and, over time, helping 
centers to find additional funding to support their work.
One of our early activities of the CRN has been to establish a
database.  The CRN database will be a World Wide Web directory 
of researchers, both university and community-based, willing to 
participate in public interest and community-initiated research 
activities.  The Loka Institute has contracted with the Unison 
Institute, a non-profit organization committed to providing 
information technology in the public interest, to design and 
develop the database.  The database will identify researchers by 
the following categories: name, location, type of research and 
principal research methods.  It will also provide data on each 
researcher's background, groups they have worked with, criteria 
for working with groups, and fees if any.    It will include an 
"auto-E-mail responder" and printing capability for those who do 
not have web access but do have E-mail.  The database will also 
offer organizations an opportunity to add their own information 
to the database.  
<p>
It is our understanding that the database will be useful for
organizations and individuals in need of public interest 
researchers.  For example, ACORN, the largest constituency based 
organization serving low-and-moderate income communities across 
the country finds it very difficult to find public interest 
researchers to help them gather data for campaigns.  With a 
database of researchers at their fingertips, they can connect 
directly with hundreds of researchers across the country willing 
to help them on, for example, gathering and analyzing data on 
environmental justice cases, welfare reform, distribution of 
public services, etc.  This database, however, will also be 
helpful for smaller community organizations and individuals 
providing they have access to the database.  Ideally, however, 
they would not only have access to the database, but to their 
own local community research center.  Center staff would bring 
community members in personal contact with local experts in the 
particular field of interest to pursue through research collaboration.
<p>
Our targeted end-users of the database are the growing group of
disenfranchised citizens:  for example, workers whose jobs are 
changing without their involvement; people of diverse racial and 
ethnic backgrounds (whose neighborhoods have a disproportionate 
number of hazardous waste treatment plants and disposal sites); 
and low income neighborhoods. CTCNet has demonstrated that when 
these citizens receive information technology training and 
access others take for granted, job possibilities and organizing 
opportunities become available.  Access to the CRN database will 
help communities acquire the knowledge needed to take action on 
critical issues.  Not only does this enable people to resolve 
some of their most pressing problems, but it reinvigorates their 
faith in their ability to make the system work for them.
CTCNet and the CRN are networks of people working for people.  I
am happy to work with CTCNet for the purpose of building 
community.
