<P>
At the time of the last issue of the <I>CTCNet Review</I>, the
CTCNet research and evaluation team had completed the first phase
of our research. Thanks to the support of affiliates, the initial
phase of our work was very successful.
<P>
During the first phase, we worked intensively with five sites
to find out more about the impact of technology access on individuals.
Our research consisted primarily of interviews with participants
at the centers. We spoke with a very diverse group of individuals
who participated in a variety of program offerings at the five
centers. From these interviews, we have begun to develop a better
understanding of how technology access is changing people's lives.
(More detailed information on the report can be found in the Spring/Summer
issue of the <I>CTCNet Review</I> or from the report, <A HREF="http://www.ctcnet.org/eval.html"><I>Community Technology Centers: Impact on Individuals and their Communities</I></A>.)
The information in this report already been used by several affiliates
in grant proposals.

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#000080">Quantitative Participant Impact 
Study</font></b><br>

In the second phase of research, we are concentrating
on developing a better understanding of impacts across CTCNet
as a whole. Work on a national survey to collect data on the impact of
technology center access on participants began in mid 1997.  In
June a copy of the initial draft of the survey was circulated at
the All-Affiliates conference.  Feedback from the conference led
to revisions of the survey, which was then pilot-tested at two
Boston area CTCNet computing centers.  Results from the
pilot-test, together with review and reconsideration of the goals
of the evaluation and the findings from the qualitative study
were incorporated into subsequent revisions.  Feedback from
CTCNet staff and the research advisors was also solicited. 
<p>
The survey seeks to collect information from participants (a)
about the individuals' reasons for coming to a community
technology center, (b) about the learning goals which they may
have brought to the center and the extent to which participants
perceive that these goals are being met, (c) about their
satisfaction level with services and outcomes, and (d) about
their demographic background. 

All 266 affiliates in the network were invited to participate in
the study, and representatives at 70 sites responded.  Of the 70
affiliates who expressed interest in the study 23 were not in a
position to participate because computer centers at those
locations were not yet in operation.  Therefore, the directors at
the 47 remaining sites were asked to estimate the number of
surveys they could administer in a three week period.  Based on
these estimates three mailings totaling 3,180 surveys were sent
out. 

Affiliates in the study were asked to seek responses from as many
adult and teen participants as possible.  Presently, these
surveys are being conducted in both paper and electronic format. 
One of the affiliates, an assistive center, has arranged for the
survey to be administered to the visually handicapped exclusively
through a computer application format.  Data entry is underway,
and analysis is expected to begin in February.  Each
participating center will receive a summary of the data collected
from their site, along with a copy of the final report from the
national study. 
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#000080">Longitudinal Impact Study</FONT></b>
<br>
The final design plan for the longitudinal study of impact on
individual users was undertaken in the fall of 1997.  Interview
data collected in 1996 for the qualitative study were reviewed
and prospective subjects selected.  At the present time, the team
has constructed parameters and methods to ensure a good level of
representation by a diverse set of participants in the study.  We
have evaluated candidate participants from previous pilot studies
at the centers and from the qualitative study interview group for
suitability for inclusion in the longitudinal study.  We will
choose a set of participants whose stories are representative of
a variety of compelling experiences and goals, e.g. a senior who
uses e-mail to affordably maintain community with family and
friends, a middle-aged man out of work and trying to gain new job
skills, and a teenager earning money by creating World Wide Web
versions of jobseekers' resumes.  In each case that we choose, we
will also collect information about the entire scope of the
participant's interaction with the center, about the impact of
that relationship on other parts of the participant's community,
and about the center's community itself, to try to build a full
picture of what the center means in that person's life. 
<p>

Directors of centers from which candidates will be drawn have
been contacted in order to solicit their help and cooperation. 
During the coming month the team will finalize choices of
participants and concurrently will be creating a protocol to
guide the semi-structured interview.  Interviews will begin in
late February or early March. 
<p>

The longitudinal study will include approximately 12 subjects,
with a projection that it will be possible to follow half of
those original 12 through the full three years of the study. 
Subjects will be drawn from participants at the Somerville
Community Computing Center in Somerville, MA and the United South
End Settlement in Boston, MA, and perhaps from other sites, such
as the Brooklyn Public Library Literacy Program in Brooklyn, NY,
Virtually Wired in Boston, MA, the Hard Disk Cafe in Gloucester,
MA, and Malden Access Television in Malden, MA.

<b><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#000080">Community Resource Mapping</font></b><br>
Community resource mapping is a process by which certain assets
within a community are inventoried.  Such assets could be, for
example, sources of funding, equipment, or other materials;
individuals with useful knowledge and skills; and organizations
with actual or potential interest in supporting efforts to
strengthen conditions and relationships within a neighborhood or
community.  During the summer, a pilot mapping study was
conducted by Elizabeth Goodsell, the CTCNet evaluation team's
summer fellow, with the intent of developing materials to
encourage interested affiliates to conduct their own community
resource mapping project. 
<p>
As a result of the pilot study, a guide, entitled 
<a href="http://WWW.CTCNET.ORG/mapping.html">
<i>Forging
Community Links: A Resource Mapping Guide for CTCNet Affiliates,</i></a>
was produced to help affiliates carry out a similar resource
mapping process on their own.  Drawing upon strategies described
in <i>Building Communities from the Inside Out: A Path Toward
Finding and Mobilizing a Community's Assets,</i> by John Kretzmann
and John McKnight, a member of the research team identified
community connections that had been developed by two Boston area
affiliates:  the Dorchester Family YMCA and the Asian-American
Civic Association.  These connections were identified by
interviewing staff and volunteers, board members, visitors, and
students at both sites, local businesses and passersby in the
community, as well as funders and other partner organizations. 
For both affiliates, a map was constructed to show actual and
potential linkages to other community-based or nonprofit
organizations, government agencies, businesses, and individuals. 
Some benefits of community resource mapping mentioned in the
guide are that it makes relationships between a center and a
community visible for staff to use in the following ways: 
planning programs, seeking volunteers and other forms of support,
and reflecting on the role of the center as a community-building
agent. 
<p>
The guide details practical procedures and tools useful in
carrying out such a project.  It, along with other CTCNet
publications, can be accessed on the Internet at
<a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/publics.html">
http://www.ctcnet.org/publics.html.</a> Research staff members
presented findings from the report to center directors and other
participants at the 1997 CTCNet All-Affiliates meeting in
Pittsburgh, PA.  We continue to seek additional ways for our
findings to be useful to the community technology community,
including staff at affiliate centers, volunteers, and users, as
well as the broader research and funding community which supports
this work. 
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#000080">Projected Research Activities for 
Year 4</font></b>
<br> 
One component of the evaluation team's work
for Year 4 will continue to revolve around the quantitative
research effort.  Each affiliate that participated in the
national survey will receive a summary of the data submitted by
individuals who access the technology offered at their site. 
These summaries will be helpful for affiliates to use in seeking
funding and other forms of support, evaluating their impact
locally, and developing press releases and other promotional
materials. 
<p>
A second component of the work will be the continuation of the longitudinal 
study, as described elsewhere in this report.
<p>
In addition to the dual research efforts, a tool kit will be created in Year 
4 to help affiliates carry out their own needs assessments, impact 
evaluations, and mapping of community resources.  This tool kit will contain 
a variety of instruments, such as interview protocols, observation 
protocols, staff questionnaires, participant questionnaires, and 
sign-in/tracking procedures.  Several tools will be based on instruments 
used in this current project, while others may be ones that have been tested 
and recommended by staff at CTCNet or at CTCNet affiliates or they may be 
adaptations of instruments used by other community-based organizations and 
informal education programs.  Considering the technology focus of CTCNet 
centers, computer-based tools will be included in the tool kit, in the form 
of spreadsheet or database templates for PCs and Macintoshes.  In addition 
to these electronic tools, certain software applications such as 
survey-processing programs will also be described.  The tool kit will be 
designed to help affiliates make informed choices about what tools to use 
and how to use them.
<p>
A final component of next year's research and evaluation research work will 
be to disseminate the results of the national survey in a variety of ways: 
through reports that will be posted on the CTCNet web site, presentations to 
be offered at regional and annual affiliate meetings, and publications and 
presentations offered to the broader community of those interested in 
informal learning, technology and education, and programs that bring 
opportunities to disadvantaged populations.
