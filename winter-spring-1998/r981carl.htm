      </I></A><BR>A blatant plug from Carl Kucharski, who authored the Toolkit: 
      <BR>Useful, relevant information and accessible resources are keys to the 
      success of any planning process. The OTFC created the Oregon 
      Telecommunications Planning Toolkit to assist others in developing their 
      local and regional telecommunications plans and projects. This Toolkit is 
      intended to provide ideas to inspire community mobilization, guidance in 
      the local planning process, examples of projects, and links to resources, 
      information, and other communities of interest. Although much of the 
      Toolkit refers to under-served, high-cost rural areas, the planning 
      principles, examples and implementation techniques are applicable to most 
      situations. As a living document, a work in progress, the Toolkit will 
      continue to grow as local and regional plans and projects are added to the 
      kit. <BR><BR><B><FONT color=#000080 size=4>TELECOMMUNICATIONS

      that the Net will ultimately become much more than just another multimedia 
      tool in the learning process. In an attempt to measure the impact 
      of the Internet on the American educational system, we gathered a panel 
      of top educators. 10 teachers, administrators, and policy makers from 
      across the United States and asked them to assess the Internet in five 
      major respects: The pace of wiring the nation's schools. The pace of 
      training the nation's teachers. The general effect on student performance. 
      The specific effect on student performance in individual subjects. The

      <BR>America's New Deficit: The Shortage of Information Technology Workers, 
      a new US Commerce Department Office of Technology Policy study (available 
      in Adobe Acrobat [.pdf] format only, suggests that the United States 
      "could face a growing shortage of information technology workers that 
      would have severe consequences for U.S. competitiveness, economic growth, 
      and job creation." It provides evidence that fast growing companies have 
      trouble finding enough information technology workers for their 
      operations. As a solution to this problem, the study recommends that the 
      United States develop its labor force skills to maintain its lead in 
      productivity and competitiveness.

      <BR></B>The Conservation Technology Support Program (CTSP) is an annual

      organizations to build their Geographic Information Systems (GIS) 
      capacity. GIS makes possible truly interactive collaborations among 
      resource managers, policy setters, scientists and stakeholders enabling 
      both the technical and the social resolution of natural resource issues. 
      CTSP has provided close to $3 million in inkind grants to 150 conservation 
      and environmental groups. CTSP requests letters of inquiry from nonprofit 
      groups that need to initiate or upgrade their geographic information 
      systems (GIS) to address conservation and environmental issues. Letters of 
      inquiry for awards announced in April 1998 were due January 2, 1998. For
