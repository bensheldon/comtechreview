<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#000080">by Mark Lloyd</FONT></B>

<P>
This essay is about the relationship between civil rights and
communications policy, the interplay between that set of rights
we hold because we are citizens and the rules our representatives
create which direct the activity of communications companies such
as AT&amp;T, TimeWarner/Turner, and Disney/ABC. It is also an
argument that communications policy is of central importance to
all Americans, that it touches on our fundamental rights, that
communications policy is a civil rights issue. 
<P>
The historical relationship between the civil rights movement
and communications policy provides a useful perspective to present
and future challenges. Indeed, it is those challenges which make
the ideas and passions of the civil rights movement so necessary
in the debate over communications policy today, for this is the
arena in which so many of our basic rights appear and are given
meaning&#8212;the right to speak, the right to know, the right to
information, the right to privacy, the right to equal economic
opportunity, the right to equal educational opportunity, and the
right to meaningful participation in the political process. The
historic struggle to preserve and defend these rights is the prelude
to our future.
<P>
<B>The Past is Prologue</B>
<P>
Fifty years ago, as Jackie Robinson began his historic sojourn
across the for-whites-only baseball playgrounds, the modern civil
rights movement was on the verge of critical victories, although
public attention and interest was not immediately apparent. The
nation was prosperous and heady with its new position of leadership
after World War II. If the leaders of the nation agreed about
which issues of the day required attention, that attention was
focused on imagined internal and external threats posed by communism.
The pages of <i>Time Magazine,</I> the <i>New York Times,</I> and the radio
and television newscasts paid rare attention to what was then
called &quot;the Negro problem.&quot; Television sets went on
sale only a year earlier, and black Americans were viewed through
the voices and images of white Americans through popular programs
such as &quot;Amos and Andy&quot; and &quot;The Jack Benny Show,&quot;
featuring Rochester. The first black-owned radio station, WERD
in Atlanta, was not on the air until 1949. Few cameras ventured
south to capture the violence of the non-violent civil rights
movement. When the networks did produce documentaries about what
was going on down south, those programs were not shown in the
south. 
<P>
The civil rights leader, the Reverend Everett C. Parker, the head
of the United Church of Christ, decided something had to be done
about television's treatment of blacks. He started an office of
communications at the church and in March of 1964 began tape recording
the broadcasts of the two television stations in Jackson, Mississippi,
WLBT&#8212;the NBC affiliate, and WJTV&#8212;the ABC affiliate. You
know what he found. Though blacks comprised 45 percent of the
audience, the stations ignored them, and eliminated any of the
networks' coverage of blacks. The White Citizens Council could
express its opinion but local black ministers were not allowed
on the air. Most black folk in Jackson, Mississippi never complained
about this, they took it for granted that that's the way things
were. The United Church of Christ along with local NAACP officials
confronted the Federal Communications Commission with a long list
of violations, and by a four to two decision, the FCC renewed
the licenses of the Jackson stations for one year&#8212;pending good
behavior. Reverend Parker was not satisfied. The church challenged
the FCC in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia. The church
argued that the white-only programming of the stations violated
the Fairness Doctrine, and was not &quot;in the public interest&quot;
of either black or white viewers in Jackson, Mississippi. The
court overruled the FCC. That ruling ultimately led to the loss
of WLBT's license.
<P>
Because it recognized the power of viewers to petition the FCC
and take it to court, the United Church of Christ decision has
been aptly characterized as the &quot;Magna Carta for active public
participation in broadcast regulation.&quot; This newly recognized
power spurred citizen engagement with communications policy, and
led to a process whereby stations were required to ascertain the
issues of interest to the community they were licensed to serve
by interviewing a wide range of local leaders. The station then
had to report to the FCC, showing both the results of its ascertainment
survey and how the community interests were reflected in programming.
This ascertainment process clarified the political relationship
between community and broadcast station, and it empowered local
activists. Stations were forced to respond to local concerns about
news and public affairs coverage, and to some extent even prime
time entertainment programming. The FCC was finally hearing from
the communities the licensees were obligated to serve. The result
was more news and public affairs programming, more diversity of
views expressed, and arguably better television and radio service&#8212;an
outcome the market failed to create.
<P>
The civil rights movement continued to work in the vineyard of
communications policy, and continued to have success. Protests
over the lack of minorities on staff at the broadcast stations
led the Kerner Commission to examine the role of media in exacerbating
the racial tensions that ultimately resulted in the widespread
urban rioting in the late 1960's. The Kerner Commission warned
that newspapers and television &quot;have not communicated to
whites a feeling for the difficulties and frustrations of being
a Negro in the United States... The world that television and
newspapers offer to their black audience is almost totally white...&quot; 
Protests by civil rights groups and the Kerner report
led to FCC adoption of equal employment opportunity provisions.
Those provisions called for an accounting of minorities employed
at the stations and asked the stations to compare the numbers
of minorities and women on staff to the number of minorities and
women in the station's service area. The FCC also asked stations
to send job announcements to places where likely candidates might
be found. Many of those places were the offices of the local NAACP
or Urban League. 
<P>
In the late Seventies, in recognition of the lack of progress
made with these employment policies, the FCC ruled that minority
ownership was essential to create a diverse range of messages
over the public's airwaves. Once again, civil rights leaders were
at the forefront of the battle for rules to promote minority ownership.
Among those testifying before Congress in support of such rules
in 1974 were Ron Brown, on behalf of the National Urban League,
and Joseph Rauh, Jr., on behalf of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights. Policies promoting minority ownership were established
by the FCC, and reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the Metro Broadcasting
decision of 1990.
<P>
But now, the great progress made by the civil rights communities
in the communications policy arena has been rolled back. The Reagan-dominated
FCC destroyed the ascertainment process, arguing that it was too
much of an administrative burden on the stations and on the FCC.

<P>
Licensing renewal now can be accomplished with a postcard, certifying
that the station can meet some stringent financial requirements,
but that is about it. The Reagan-Bush FCC tried to destroy the
affirmative action/EEO guidelines and the ownership diversity
programs, but the Democrats in Congress prevented FCC action.

<P>
In April 1995, however, the Republican Congress teamed up with
President Clinton to kill the most effective method for increasing
minority ownership, the tax certificate. With minority-owned broadcast
licenses stuck at around 3 percent, loss of the tax certificate
makes any progress beyond that invisible ceiling impossible. And
in June 1995, in reaction to the Supreme Court's Adarand decision,
the FCC rescinded rules designed to help women and minorities
participate effectively in the spectrum auctions for PCS licenses.
<P>
<B>Then Came the Telecommunications Act of 1996 or Show Me the
Money</B> 
<P>
On February 8, 1996, a week after extended support in the House
and Senate was vocalized, President Clinton signed the Telecommunications
Act of 1996. While touted as a landmark bill updating the sixty-year-old
Communications Act for the benefit of U.S. consumers, the T96
Act was created by and for a communications industry dominated
by global conglomerates. The influence of this global industry
over the national legislative process was hinted at in the scandal
over the Speaker of the House's much publicized book deal with
the international media magnate Rupert Murdoch. But the book deal
was the tip of the iceberg. According to Charles Lewis of the
Center for Public Integrity, Senate Leader Bob Dole received hundreds
of thousands of dollars before the T96 Act from communications
companies such as TCI and Time/Warner in direct contributions
and through support of Dole fronts such as the Better America
Foundation. As Ken Auletta reported in the <i>New Yorker,</i> AT&amp;T
spent nearly $1.3 million in soft-money contributions to both
parties in 1994 alone. And the political action committees of
the broadcasting industry, long considered the most powerful special
interest group in the country, contributed over $1.3 million during
the 1995-96 election cycle. For the first six months of 1996,
the broadcast industry spent at least $10.7 million dollars in
lobbying Congress, the Clinton Administration, and the FCC.
<P>
The question must be asked: Whose interests were our representatives
representing when they passed this legislation? In the absence
of a strong public interest presence, the money spent by private
industry in the political process reflected major distortion in
the public debate. A good example of this distortion can be seen
in the statements of the Clinton administration's point man on
communications issues, Vice-President Gore. 
<P>
In 1992, while campaigning for office, Senator Al Gore introduced
the idea of the &quot;information superhighway.&quot; Perhaps
as a defense of public investment, Gore said the information highway
&quot;ought to be built by the federal government&quot; much like
the interstate highway system. In fact, the high-risk and hard
work of research and development of the high-capacity data link
between academic institutions and military bases was made possible
through federal funding. This link later became known as the Internet.
The development of the Internet is a good example of government
generating benefits for the public at large; a rich story for
public interest advocates to tell. However, a year after extolling
the federal government's role in building the information superhighway,
and many campaign contributions later with, no doubt, hopes of more
to come, the 
Vice-President announced that &quot;unlike the interstates, the
information highways will be built, paid for, and funded by the
private sector.&quot; He announced the administration's support
of removal of &quot;judicial and legislative restrictions on all
types of telecommunications companies: cable, telephone, utilities,
television, and satellite.&quot;
<P>
The Vice-President's representatives denied any connection between
the financial largess of the communications industry and the Vice-President's
180-degree turnaround on the role of private industry, but he
now ignores past and present public and government support (i.e.,
the tax dollars of ordinary citizens) in favor of making private
industry's contribution seem dominant and therefore controlling.
As private industry is given credit for building the road, so
private industry dominates discussion about the rules of that
road. While citizens are blinded to the government support that
makes the road possible, they remain blind to their right to benefit
from their contribution.
<P>
The industry compromise that became the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 was sold to the American public as a great consumer victory.
Competition, it was reported, would reduce prices and provide
more services. Despite the promise of greater competition, the
effect of the Act has been an unprecedented wave of consolidation
and partnerships of mutual interest among potential competitors.
Less than a half-dozen communications corporations now control
more than 90 percent of the communications companies in the U.S.,
because of the record-setting mergers and acquisitions, and the
destruction of regulations that once encouraged new market entrants.
Local telephone companies were allowed to combine and provide
long distance service. National broadcast ownership limits were
increased to 35 percent. Prohibitions limiting the ownership of
radio, television, and newspapers by one company in the same market
were lifted, thus encouraging media consolidation and the crowding
out of independent voices. Broadcast license periods were increased,
making it virtually impossible for local communities to exercise
any control over the stations licensed to serve them. And only
existing broadcasters will be given additional spectrum to broadcast
high definition digital signals, creating a further barrier to
competition and new voices. The early promises of competition
and reduced prices have failed to materialize, as has the promise
of new jobs. Prices, particularly cable prices, have gone up.
Employment growth is negligible and wages are depressed, particularly
in the telephone industry. And something even more fundamental
and dangerous has occurred. 
<P>
Far more troubling than the broken promises to consumers has been
the shift in the public debate. That shift began during the Reagan
years of the 1980's, with the crude pronouncements of Chairman
Mark Fowler, when the FCC moved quickly to merge the concept of
the public interest with the myth of the market. This shift in
the public interest standard peaked in the 90's, perhaps best
demonstrated by the essays of Nicholas Negroponte in <i>Wired</i> magazine
(who asserted &quot;there will be no information have nots, only
information want-nots&quot;) and a manifesto funded by Newt Gingrich's
Progress and Freedom Foundation, &quot;Cyberspace and the American
Dream: A Magna Carta for the Knowledge Age.&quot; Under the signatures
of Esther Dyson, Alvin Toffler, George Keyworth, and George Gilder,
the &quot;Magna Carta&quot; is a relentlessly upbeat stew of cyberspeak,
utopian fantasy, and laissez-faire economics. Unlike the Magna
Carta-like United Church of Christ case, this new &quot;Magna
Carta&quot; left the determination of the public interest to the
not-so-invisible hand of a market dominated by international conglomerates,
not the direct engagement of the local community. 
<P>
Those voices that once called for equality and public responsibility
in the communications arena were unprepared for the strategic
shift in the terms of the communications debate. That shift asserted
that something new was happening around digital technologies and
fiber optics, and the old problems of monopolistic behavior and
the market's inability to correct human bigotry somehow did not
matter anymore. And the civil rights community was largely silent.
As a result, the conversation is now centered on the citizen as
&quot;consumer,&quot; who will be provided cheap costs, and dazzling
choices in entertainment services and technology. The civil rights
agenda has given way to the agenda of the commercial market. The
stirring call to community is no longer &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;
but &quot;Show Me The Money.&quot;
<P>
The work of the civil rights community has suffered through a
sustained assault by the right. The core of that assault is to
deny funding to civil rights work, silence liberal voices, and
set the agenda of public debate by an opposition that is better
funded, more organized, and more savvy about strategic communications.
The assault on affirmative action, welfare, multi-cultural studies,
immigration, and foundations supporting progressive causes has
been carefully orchestrated. Combined with this assault is a relentless
marketing of the failed dogma of laissez-faire economics. 
<P>
Long removed from the experience of the Great Depression, America's
latest romance with the neat theories of unfettered markets has
infiltrated every discussion of national policy with disastrous
consequences in nearly every field including law, health care,
and communications. This &quot;market&quot; or &quot;laissez-faire&quot;
capitalist vision of society holds that the common good is best
understood as an unchecked individual pursuit of economic self-interest.
This &quot;market&quot; vision has a particularly invidious effect
on communications policy where commercial communications interests
have long been formidable adversaries, adept at co-opting government
and, more important, shaping public opinion.
<P>
<B>A Civil Rights Vision of America</B>
<P>
The failure of laissez-faire economics as a foundation for communications
policy is made most clear in the arena of children's programming.
Despite countless studies demonstrating that people mimic behaviors
shown on television, despite the 1972 Surgeon General's report,
&quot;Television and Growing Up: the Impact of Televised Violence,&quot;
the Reagan FCC effectively destroyed regulations that called for
educational programming for children and limited the number of
commercials that could run during children's shows. Not content
with jettisoning the government's public interest standard, the
Reagan Justice Department forced the National Association of Broadcasters
to eliminate its own code of conduct in 1982. The result, of course,
was an unfettered market, and a dramatic increase in the level
of violence and sexual behavior and commercials children were
exposed to on television. So upset about the result of this free
market mania, Congress passed, without President Bush's signature
and after an earlier veto by President Reagan, the Children's
Television Act of 1990. The commercial television industry made
a mockery of that Act, as has been made clear by the work of the
Center for Media Education which, in 1992, showed that dozens
of broadcasters had listed cartoons such as <&quot;>The Jetsons<&quot;> 
as educational children's programming. Clearly, the market 
fails to provide for children's needs. Media activists
and children's rights advocates and ordinary concerned parents
joined to battle for enforceable rules based upon an alternative
vision of what should drive policy, a vision based upon the needs
of children, a vision that puts a healthy community before the
avarice of broadcasters. 
<P>
For the far right to argue that getting out of the business of
regulation is the only constructive role for government to play
is as blind as it is disingenuous. The challenge is to create
a set of rules that reflects the best nature of our society. As
Newton Minow makes clear in <i>Abandoned in the Wasteland,</I>
the issue is not really whether the market provides good choices,
but whether citizens have a real say in what those choices are.
The issue is whether the parent must let his child be a consumer,
or, more to the point, a product to be sold to advertisers, or
whether the parent has a right as a citizen to demand more. As
demonstrated above, one of the few actors influential enough to
overcome the prerogatives of the commercial interests and assert
the needs of communities in the field of communications policy
has been the civil rights groups. 
<P>
The civil rights community has been in the vanguard of progressive
action in the U.S. for many years. The work of the NAACP, the
Urban League, the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights, and
others have demonstrated effective strategies for civil action
to other minorities, women's groups, children's advocates, environmentalists,
and gays. Undergirding those strategies has been an articulate
vision of a society of decent people who understand that we make
a nation together. This vision lives in the work of thousands
of community organizations, full of smart and talented people
who are paid a relative pittance to help create better neighborhoods.
It lives in the new &quot;volunteer&quot; movement. 
<P>
Moreover, the civil rights vision of America, the dream, as King
argued, is deeply rooted in the American dream. It is the dream
of America as a principled democratic community embodying the
spirit of brotherhood and equality. It is a vision of America
as a place of sanctuary and celebration of that portion of humanity
cast off from less-closed societies. As King argued in his famous
Letter from the Birmingham Jail, the civil rights movement is
not the creator of tension, but seeks &quot;to bring to the surface
the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the
open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can
never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened
with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light,
injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates,
to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion
before it can be cured.&quot;
<P>
And the cure was only that America live up to &quot;the real promise
of democracy.&quot; The philosopher Karl Popper called this promise
an &quot;open society,&quot; a society where all boils could be
exposed to the crucible of public discussion and debate. In a
similar vein, Robert McChesney and others make the point that
a critical factor in the rise and success of democratic movements
is the existence of a public sphere for democratic deliberation.
The public sphere is a place where citizens can interact, study,
and debate the issues of the day, a place dominated by neither
government nor corporate interests. This shining civil rights
vision of a democratic helping community is untarnished by conservative
business propaganda.
<P>
The language of equality and citizenship rights and community
needs, about which civil rights advocates speak so potently, is
embedded in the 
concepts of public trusteeship and diversity of expression made
explicit in the 1934 Communications Act and the subsequent amendments
to that Act. Broadcasters (to whom the public airwaves are licensed),
telephone and cable and satellite oligopolies (which benefit from
government regulation, support, and public rights-of-way) are
all responsible for acting in &quot;the public interest, convenience,
and necessity.&quot; The failure of our representatives (and the
expert regulators they appoint) in federal and state offices is
not a failure of the public interest standard as such, but a failure
of the public to demand a public-oriented definition of that standard
and its enforcement. Just as the poor black and white folk of
Jackson, Mississippi had no idea they had a right to service from
their local television stations, most Americans have no idea they
have rights with respect to the commercial communications companies
that dominate their environment. Just as the civil rights community
stepped in in Jackson, the civil rights community needs to step
in today.
<P>
History shows that civil rights advocates have been effective
actors in the communications policy debates. Former FCC Commissioners
Ben Hooks, Tyrone Brown, Henry Rivera, and Andrew Barrett especially,
successfully linked civil rights interests to communications policies.
Though communications policy has been reduced and marginalized
to a debate over the proper mechanisms to induce competition,
and hype about which new gadgets will create the new consumer
utopia, the civil rights community has shown that communications
policy is really about determining those rules that will establish
equality in a free, plural, and democratic society. The civil
rights community has demonstrated that the communications policy
debate is really about free speech and equality of voice in the
public debate, the right to know and equality of access to public
information and resources, equality of economic and educational
opportunity and the right to meaningful democratic participation
in the political process.
