Peace and blessings to the members of this highly esteemed sorority,
honored guests, family members, and friends gathered this afternoon.
I first give all thanks and praise to God, who is the great Architect
of my life.  For I am nothing, I can do nothing without His power
and His energy working in and through me.  And the joy of my life
comes in rendering service to others as if rendering service unto
God.  The honor given truly goes to Him, for without His compelling
energy propelling me over the past ten years, the Institute for
Academics After School Tutorial Program and anything else I've
been able to do would not have taken place.
<P>
 Marvelous things happen in this program for seemingly 
everyone&#8212;children,
parents, elder, and volunteers&#8212;all involved in a life-changing,
very often inwardly transforming process.  To have my name mentioned
with the name of Dorothy I. Height, someone I have revered all
of my adult life, is very humbling to me.  I feel as though I
fall short when it comes to her outstanding life's work that is
worthy of emulation.  I keep saying, &quot;Wow, this is what the
letter said,&quot; and I have read it quietly many, many times.
De oko kahn, I do pray that, a kurole, my sisters, in the
words of our forefathers, &quot;from my heart to yours, I thank
you this evening, my sisters.&quot;
<P>
 There are many thanks I must give this afternoon.  I stand here
not alone, for I am the sum total of those who have gone before.
 I thank God for allowing me to have two beautiful parents with
kind, generous, and loving spirits, both of whom knew my weaknesses
but highlighted and encouraged my strengths.  Igbae baye tonu, God
rest their souls.  They taught me to see the good in people, and
without too much commotion or talk, go on and do something to
assist the situation and move on.  I thank the energy of my ancestor,
Nannie Helen Burroughs, an honored member of Delta Sigma Theta,
a school builder whose vision, capabilities, and know-how have
been shared with this descendant.  I thank my Aunt &quot;Vi&quot;,
who is here with me today, for being a volunteer in the After
School Program for over six years, and being the wonderful octogenarian
plus, being the kind of role model and support she has been throughout
my life.  I thank God's divine intervention that opened up the
way for me to meet and work with such wonderful people as Dr.
G.R. Coleman, who knew in 1985 that our children were in trouble,
and that something extra had to be done to help improve their
lives; Phil Shapiro, a committed supporter, friend, and volunteer
in the Program since 1987, who never stopped sharing, caring,
and connecting; Ambassador Charles Alexander James, who wants
our After School Program children to fly, in the literal sense
of the word, and he is an encouraging supporter.  I thank all
the other volunteers, supporters, and our wonderful parents, who
have remained committed to the success of their After School Program,
and all those who helped to develop me spiritually to be able
to do the work that God has allowed me to do, to enhance the lives
of those I have met in some small way.  
<P>
 Delta Sigma Theta, Federal City Alumnae Chapter City Chapter, I thank you for
this now.  But we, the collective we, have a long way to go. 
I have learned that the only way that we are going to accomplish
the good for our people, for our children, is that we have to
do it together.  We must link hands.  We must support one another.
 We are the community.  We are the true village.  Because the
time is now for the village, the community, to take its real stand,
we must do for our children what our elders did for us.  We must
practice opening our hearts wider to loving ourselves more, cutting
out inundating, hollow rhetoric and acting right now to lift and
elevate our people. You are to be commended for your outreach
efforts and long tradition of social action.  I think you should
come to our After School Program.  See the gleam that comes in
unfolding a child's mind.  See the light restored to an elder's
sagacious face because a child taught him how to operate a computer.
 Or see that child beam with pride because they actually taught
an elder to operate a computer.  Here is an opportunity for you
to benefit from your labors.  The biggest reward is the child
who wants to grow, who wants to learn, who rejects the wrong and
accepts the right because of your help, your intervention in their
lives.  
<P>
 This is our appointed hour.  And I believe, as Susan Taylor did,
that when we find security in ourselves, we can save and lift
others.  I am enlisting the support, as has recently been indicated, 
of Delta to help our IFA-ASTP children and their super-[moms].  Together,
we can make a difference.  Our programs need the buildings so
that we may open this unique opportunity and blessings to other
children in our own space.  We need funding assistance and support.
 Some children with great difficulty are the best children in
our After School Program.  Please work with us to help our children
and our people succeed.
<P>
 Again, I thank you for this honor.  And what you have done today
encourages my heart to do even more, for we are not doing enough
in the right way to help our children and our people.  We have
talked enough.  We have analyzed, scrutinized, diagnosed, planned,
written enough papers.  Please, let's link hands, roll up our
sleeves, and do something today to help our children.  The elders
knew what to do, and we do, too.  Please help us save our children
and save our people.  May God continue to ignite in us all the
flame of service that enhances our spirits, heals our hearts,
and satisfies our very souls.  I do pray, my sisters, thank
you very much.  [applause]
