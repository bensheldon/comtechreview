This fall, the Ohio Community Computing Center Network (OCCCN) 
celebrated the openings of three community computing
centers in Ohio. These centers, which are located in Cleveland
and Toledo, complete the commitment by Ameritech-Ohio to open
14 community computer centers in Ohio to serve low-income neighborhoods.
As with all of the other Ameritech funded centers located in Akron,
Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Marietta, Toledo, and Youngstown
these new centers will receive three years of funding totaling
$150,000.
<P>

hspace=8>The first 
of these final three to open is located in the Salvation
Army Temple Corp in Cleveland, Ohio. Mayor Michael R. White is 
cutting the ribbon, accompanied by Jacqueline Woods, President, 
Ameritech, Dan Farslow, Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 
Councilman Michael Plensek, and Major Joseph Pritchard, 
Salvation Army Temple Corps. <p>
Permeil Dass is the center
coordinator and has designed an environment that has an ISDN connection
which enables simultaneous internet access through each of the
12 computer workstations in the center. The center offers a wide
variety of courses in basic computer skills, introduction to Microsoft
Word, after school programs, and internet training. Since this
center is located in a major social service agency, which has
a strong referral program, clients are accessed and placed within
programs and courses that best suit their needs.
<P>
Also opening in Cleveland this fall was the West Side Community
Computing Center. This center has a strong community partnership
foundation involving more than 12 social service agencies, churches,
development associations, and businesses. Included in this partnership
is Bill Callahan and The Stockyard Area Development Association.
The Stockyard Area Development Association is known throughout
this community for their computer recycling ownership and training
program. This center incorporates much of the vision of that program
by offering courses and programs that empower the community with
access to computer technology. Part of the driving force behind
the programming for this center strives to go beyond training
to teach computer literacy. This involves teaching children and
adults more than just how to use programs but enables them to
understand how computers work and how software is written.

In other OCCCN news, The Marietta Area Community 
Computing Center
and the community computing center in the Youngstown Public Library
have just entered into their third and final year of funding through
the Ameritech grants. The Columbus Urban League (see photo) 
<img src="ul.jpg" alt="" align=left>
and Volunteers
of America have just completed a very successful first year of
funding. 

The North Education Center in Columbus, 
Akron Urban League
in Akron, Akron Urban Minority Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Program, Toledo's
BDPA Information Technology Center, Cleveland's Friendly Inn Settlement
House, and Dayton's Edgemont Neighborhood Coalition continue to
thrive and excel at offering open access and training to empower
their communities through technology with the Ameritech grants.
<P>
OCCCN's membership has expanded to include several Media Access
Centers (also known as public cable access stations), HUD supported
sites, minority alcoholism outreach programs, and an ability center.

On October 10th, forty OCCCN members met in Dayton at the Edgemont
Neighborhood Coalition for the Fall meeting. Seated in the 
photo (left to right) are Lisa Lockhart, Columbus Urban 
League, Missy Lodge, State Library Foundation, Gladys Harris, 
Friendly Inn, Cleveland, Ella Bogard, Marietta. <p>The day included
an open dialog exchange of ideas for outreach, program development,
fundraising, and issues associated with charging user and/or membership
fees. There were presentations and discussion break-out groups
learning about options for internet access, internet content issues,
public policy, and an overview of the OCCCN strategic plan progress
and new by-laws. <br clear=all>
