<P>
Current census data indicate that 54 million Americans have a
disability which substantially limits one or more major life activity
(examples: seeing, walking, talking, eating, hearing, learning).
Additionally, 66% of this number (approximately 35 million people)
are unemployed. We should always be cautious never to stereotype
any individual based on statistics or type of disability. However,
these numbers indicate a very large number of persons who do
not have access to computers because of socioeconomic, architectural,
and/or technological barriers. Community Computing Centers are
in a position to play a significant role in the removal of the
barriers which prevent full community participation of individuals
with disabilities. 
<P>
Since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, there
has been a great deal of emphasis on architectural accessibility.
Certainly every program manager needs to be aware of barriers
to full participation (steps, narrow doorways, inaccessible restrooms,
communication barriers, inaccessible hardware and software, 
etc.) and
cost effective methods for their removal. However, ask any person
with a disability &quot;what is the most significant obstacle
that inhibits involvement in your community?&quot; The answer
will almost always be something like &quot;negative attitudes
of non-disabled persons toward me (or my disability).&quot;
A recent Harris poll revealed that 74% of those surveyed pity
people with disabilities, 58% are embarrassed in the presence
of a person with a disability, 47% fear that they also may become
disabled. Given CTCNet's mission, Community Computing Centers
have a much greater awareness of disability issues than society
overall; however, we must constantly strive for improvement and
be aware that our attitudes (although unintentional) are sometimes
the most inhibiting of all barriers.
<P>
Following are some ideas for improving disability awareness at
Community Computing Centers:<P>
Create a welcoming atmosphere by developing and widely distributing
an access statement. This is your commitment to empower ALL people
by providing access to technology. Following is a statement which
could be modified: &quot;We welcome all individuals and families
from our community to use the XYZ Center. If you have a disabling
condition and would like more information and support for accessibility
of facilities and programs call Jane Smith at 555-3333 (voice
or TTY).&quot; If you do not have a TTY, then list the 800 number
for your statewide relay service (directory assistance will have
this number). After you develop your access statement, do not
hide it on the back of your brochures. Put it on the front in
a prominent location. It's OK if your facility is not 100% physically
accessible... yet. Remember, the steps or lack of accessible software
are not the most inhibiting barriers!
<P>
There are, almost certainly, people with disabilities in your
community who have expertise with Information Technology. Recruit
these people as advisory board members, volunteers, staff
members, and program participants. Actively recruit persons with
disabilities for involvement in programs by forming partnerships
with local disability organizations. 
<P>
To find people with disabilities for the above roles, look in
your phone book for a Center for Independent Living or other disability
group. Also, the local office for your state's Vocational Rehabilitation
Agency or local Rehabilitation Center/Hospital. These organizations
often have employees with expertise in assistive technology (examples:
Rehabilitation Engineers, Recreational Therapists, Occupational
Therapists, etc.). 
<P>
The very best way to improve access to your programs and facilities
is to ask for help from the experts&#8212;individuals with disabilities
in your community.

Following are free and/or inexpensive resources to assist with
your efforts to ensure equal access to Community Computing Centers:

There are ten regional centers which provide technical assistance
materials. When you dial the toll-free number above, your call
will automatically ring through to the center responsible for
the region of the country that contains the area code from which
you are calling. Following are the URL's for each regional center:

technology (including adapted hardware and software):<BR>
The Technology Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities
Act of 1988 established a program in each state to &quot;increase
the availability and utilization of assistive technology devices

Too often, program managers become overwhelmed by inaccessible
facilities and equipment and the lack of funding for barrier removal
projects. Always remember that physical barriers are not the most
restrictive and &quot;the only way to eat an elephant is one bite
at a time&quot.; Take the first bite by creating a welcoming environment
that is &quot;attitudinally accessible&quot.; Removal of physical
barriers can be accomplished with successive &quot;bites&quot;
by forming partnerships with the accessibility experts in your
community.
