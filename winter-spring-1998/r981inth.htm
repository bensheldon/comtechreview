<p>

In his January talk given to the CTCNet New England regional
quarterly gathering, William Mitchell, chair of the MIT
Department of Architecture and Planning and author of City of
Bits, talked about the major urban transformation that
technological development is creating.  &quot;Consider the fiber
being laid,&quot; he asked as he showed us a photo of an open
manhole surrounded by safety cones with a policeman next to it
and a work truck nearby.  &quot;Picture banks,&quot; which were
once public institutions on Main St. with gothic pillars as befit
their status and role, Mitchell continued, and then went on to
discuss the placement of ATMs-now an acronym in the vernacular-
first in banks, then all over, and the current movement towards
home banking and electronic cash.
<P>

Finally, he offered, consider bookstores, their long history, and
the recent establishment and growth of Amazon.com, the online
bookstore that is exploding with business.  More and more
materials are being published and made available on the web as
well as through it.  The shift is dramatic.  Since Gutenberg, the
basic publishing paradigm has been (1) to print and (2) to
distribute.  With electronic communication growing more and more
ubiquitous, the reverse is now coming to be the case.  It is
possible for any major publication to be available
instantaneously, any place where there is active
telecommunications access.  It can be distributed around the
globe, and, with agreed-upon conditions, printed anywhere.  City
of Bits is, itself, an example-it is available free online and
its hard copy version is a best seller
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/City_of_Bits">
(http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/City_of_Bits/)</a>.  This issue of
the CTC Review, v.4, #1, is another example. 

<P> The 150+ pages available here integrate multimedia audio and
video as well as traditional graphics.  Moreover, much of the
material here is dynamic; you can follow it and explore as many
paths as you care to. 

<P>

This dynamism characterizes some of the special CTCNet
departments as well as this issue's features.  The online
directory will be kept up-to-date by including members and
programs as they join and their memberships are processed.  The
online &quot;Letters&quot;  department allows on-going responses
and reactions; we welcome your contributions here (send to
ctcnet@edc.org).  The &quot;Resources&quot; page, through the
active links that it provides, will also be constantly updated. 

<P>

As with issues in the past, the CTC Review continues to cover a
range of developments going on in the entire field of community
technology, as well as some of the news, information, best
practices, advice and support from and for CTCNet affiliates and
others directly involved with center-based access programs. 
Consider our lead articles: 

<P> &quot;Telecommunications Policy is a Civil Rights Issue&quot;
is a major position paper for the Civil Rights Forum on 
Communications Policy, a project directed by the author, Mark Lloyd. 
The paper is
a key presentation of the connections existing and needing to be
strengthened between current telecommunications policy and
traditional civil rights activism.  We've linked it to Mark
Lloyd's entire, unedited version, complete with notes, and to an
edited version of Abdul Akalimat's informative discussion of the
technology of cotton and automobile production and its influence
on Black History-an essay designed to help us appreciate the full
force of technological change on our social and political
development.  The link to the National Urban League connects all
this work with one of the premier Civil Rights groups that is in
the forefront of technology program development and policy
leadership. 

<P> Cary Williams' article on &quot;Computer Centers as Library
Outposts&quot; links to previous articles about some of CTCNet's
library affiliates and other technology projects going on in the
library field, especially those of Libraries for the Future, with
whom we share so many interests. 

<P>
Dale Abell's &quot;Improving Accessibility for People with Disabilities&quot; is linked to, among other things, some of the complementary programs and resources that were discussed in last month's &quot;CTC Network News.&quot;
<P>

&quot;CTCNet and the Association for Community Networking&quot;
shares links with AFCN's home page and the federal Department of
Commerce NTIA TIIAP program, which provides one of the major
sources of funding for community networking projects.  Community
networks make up a growing and influential subgroup within CTCNet
numbering in the neighborhood of eighteen affiliates. 

<P> Steve Cisler's review of the June '97 All-Affiliates
Conference in Pittsburgh is linked to multimedia conference
interviews with the people you see pictured here.  A special
thanks to George Preston, Stan Poreda, and Max Gail for making
all the equipment arrangements and conducting interviews. 

<P> The Review features additional interviews conducted by Alla
Yakovleva-with CTCNet Founder Antonia Stone and five center
directors.  Phil Shapiro's piece on Real Video, &quot;Letting
Community Voices and Images Be Heard and Seen,&quot;  exemplies
as well as presents a useful resource for any center exploring
and developing multimedia. <p> 

<b><FONT COLOR="#000080">CTCNet Updated</font><p></b>

So much has happened with CTCNet since the last issue of the
Review. To touch upon some of the major developments: 

<P>
Some new staff have come on board.  Kate Snow is now  coordinating several affiliate services, 
including our corporate donations/partnerships program and the Associates program for volunteers.  Clifton Chow and Bart Wise have joined the evaluation staff 
and surveys from participants at a variety of affiliate centers are now being analyzed.

<P>

Pierre Clark is providing some coordinating services in the
Chicago area, where we hope to hold our next All-Affiliates
Conference, although the date for this is not yet set.  Cary
Williams has left the Ohio Community Computing Center Network and
Lisa Lockhart, formerly with the Columbus Urban League, is now
sharing responsibilities with Marsha McDevitt-Stredney.  We
welcome Andrea Kimmich-Keyser back as our NY area coordinator and
thank Stephanie McIntyre for her interim help.  In the Southeast,
we are pleased to have arranged for regional coordination
services through SEIR-TEC, the SouthEast and Islands Regional
Technology in Education Consortium, one of six regional
technology consortia established by the U.S. Department of
Education.  This was arranged and is being coordinated by Don
Holznagel, SEIR-TEC's Executive Director and member of our
Advisory Board. 

<P> Throughout the summer, an election campaign was undertaken as
the CTCNet Steering Committee elected its second set of members,
most of whom convened this January in Boston to help set the
agenda for the coming year on CTCNet's road towards affiliate
self-governance. 

In 1998, the Committee plans to focus on engaging affiliates more
in the long-term development of CTCNet. 

<P>

As we &quot;go to press,&quot; CTCNet is a semi-finalist in three
Global Information Infrastructure (GII) Awards-along with a
number of our affiliates. Congratulations to the Clubhouse at the
Computer Museum, recent recipient of the Peter F. Drucker award
for nonprofit innovation.  This and other affiliate achievements
are noted in our new Awards Department.  Some CTCNet staff are
just back from the Annie E. Casey technology conference for their
Rebuilding Community Initiative grantees.  Staff are working with
film maker David Brown, who is producing a documentary on
community technology centers.  We're attending meetings with ICF
Kaiser to help implement HUD Neighborhood Networks technology
center programs in subsidized housing developments.  We've just
finished a trip to Washington, DC, where CTCNet and a number of
affiliates were featured at overlapping conferences being
sponsored by the Department of Commerce's National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the
Alliance for Public Technology (APT).
