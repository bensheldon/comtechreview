<B>The Columbia Basin Public Information Network</B> <B>(CBPIN)</B>
is a RECA Foundation program since 1994. Founding members have
created a sustainable Community Network known as The Columbia
Free-Net (TCFN). Franklin County provides dial-up phone lines,
space, power and networking expertise; BOSS Internet Group (a
commercial ISP) provides free Internet service; and the Mid-Columbia
Library (MCL) System provides a wide area network connecting 11
sites in 3 counties, with free local dial up access. The MCL and
the TCFN are interconnected so that citizens can travel freely
from one system to the other. The Columbia Free-Net provides free
e-mail to all residents, community information and resources,
and free web pages for non-commercial organizations.<BR>

<B>The Columbia Free-Net (TCFN)</B> reaches throughout four counties
providing community information and free e-mail services. The
library has seen an increase of 20% participation yearly since
Internet access has been provided. The Free-Net has seen over
4,000 new users.<BR>

<B>Community Technology Centers</B>: Affiliated with the international
<I>Community Technology Centers' Network</I> (CTCNet), 5 CTCs
were established in 1997. Each site was selected based upon their
commitment to provide services to a targeted [have-not] population,
providing staff, support, space, and commitment to integrate the
computer technology centers into their current programs.<BR>

Jeannie Enriquez, Parent Coordinator and Director of Family Learning
Center, teaches classes in adult literacy and English as a Second
Language. Learning is enhanced through the computers and the Internet.
Parents of Amistad students are provided educational resources
to help teach their children.

<P>
A 28 computer multimedia center is never empty. Teachers use
Teach Web, web pages that use existing resources to help children
learn to read and write. The lab is used during the day by Amistad
classes and by adults/families at night.<BR>

<P>
The low income housing project just opened a three-computer lab, with
scanner, printer, and CDs for all ages. HeadStart students,
the After School Homework program, residents of Kennewick Housing
Authority, and participants in the Family Self Sufficiency program
use the computer lab.

Adaptive computer equipment and software is available for the
sight impaired to learn computers and the Internet. Some have
never used a computer while others have been using The Columbia
Free-Net for years. 
<P>
<U><B>Washington State Migrant Council</B></U><B> </B>partnered
with RECA Foundation to win the CTCNet and Apple Computers grant to
develop an Employment and Training Center during the day, and
public access computer lab after hours in Pasco. WSMC assists people
on public assistant to learn computer job skills, computer training
and Internet use.<BR>

<B>CBPIN Computer Recycling Center</B> provides computers and
training to the Community Technology Centers and low-income families.
Families, such as participants in the Family Self Sufficiency
Programs, earn their computers through community service as volunteers
in the CTCs, information providers for the Free-Net, Webmasters,
and mentors.<BR>

<B>Teach Web</B> was developed by the RECA Foundation using Columbia
Industries' Youth Hires during the Summer of 1997. The elementary
teachers provided the themes for the '97/'98 school year. Youth
Hires then researched the WWW to find pertinent sites. The result:
a place where &quot;kids&quot; of all ages can use the Internet
to enhance their knowledge. Children and parents can use the site
outside of normal school hours. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="r981rec4.gif" align="left" hspace=8><BR>

Space on The Columbia Free-Net server is available for not-for-profit
organizations free of charge. The Adopt-a-Page program is designed
to support the design and maintenance of the WWW pages for those
organizations. <BR clear=all>

Mentoring programs come in many shapes and sizes: adults mentoring
families; Adults mentoring youth and children; service groups
mentoring youth organizations; technical people mentoring non-technical
people. Telementoring enhances more traditional mentoring programs
by using the telecommunications media.<BR clear="all">

&quot;The year is 1992, a small group of &quot;dreamers,&quot;
with little money but lots of enthusiasm start a nonprofit organization
with a charter of &quot;Community Networking.&quot; And the RECA
Foundation is born.&quot;<BR>

<b>Many First's for the RECA Foundation</b>
<ul>
<li>1st Free-Net in the State of Washington
<li>1st CTC in the State of Washington
<li>1st Free-Net to use a non-Unix system
<li>1st Non-Profit Board conducted on-line
</ul>
<P>
The Columbia Free-Net is a sustainable community network. In-kind 
services, volunteers, donated equipment &amp; software, and
even a little funding have made it happen. Truly a grassroots,
community-driven network, the first 3 years of service were provided
on an 80386SX based machine&#8212;even providing text based Internet
the last of these years. Today the TCFN runs on an 80486DX25 and
is in bad need of an upgrade. A separate Web server is donated
by a local ISP, while technical support and dial-up phone lines
are provided by Franklin County. Text based WWW is provided in
partnership with the local 11 branch public library.<BR>

<P>
A sustainable Community Network, 5 Community Technology Centers,
a Computer Recycling Center, local Our Town host, Teach Web, Adopt
- a - Page, Telementoring projects.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>WHERE TO NOW?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<OL>
<LI>Encourage the development of a Regional (or perhaps international)
computer recycling facility. Locating a business to recycle junked
PCs that contain lead, radium, mercury, cadmium and other hazardous
materials. While individual machines present few problems, the
25 million computers disposed of worldwide from 1991 to 1995 are
another story. 
<LI>&quot;Community Asset Mapping&quot; a process of focusing
on strengths, not problems. The process maps individual skills
&amp; assets, identifies organization's service assets, identifies
facilities for space and services, and connects them together.
The power and effectiveness as a neighborhood and community are
multiplied many fold. We're working to make the process self-directed
through technology (see 
<a href="http://www.tcfn.org/mapping"> 
http://www.tcfn.org/mapping).</a> 
<LI>A Multi-Media Disabilities Resource Center. Where families,
friends, and service agency staff can come to learn about the
most current technologies to help the disabled.
<LI>A Migrant Worker Super Highway to connect Community Networks
and Community Technology Centers along the Migrant Trail. 
<LI>Expanding The Columbia Free-net to surrounding counties that
don't have community networks or Community Technology Centers.
</OL>

<P>
The year is 1997. A small group of &quot;dreamers&quot; with little
money&#8212;but lots of enthusiasm&#8212;are making community networking
happen in the Columbia Basin. In a very different place and time,
Anne Frank wrote &quot;How wonderful it is that nobody need wait
a single moment before starting to improve the world.&quot; Don't
wait a single moment&#8212;dream a little&#8212;become part of 
your community network and/or your community technology center.
