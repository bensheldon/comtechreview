<P>
Community networks and community technology centers are both part
of the larger community technology movement. Where one flourishes,
the other is likely to be close at hand. Last spring's Computer 
Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) conference
in Seattle on <A HREF="http://www.scn.org/tech/diac-97/" 
>&quot;Community Space and Cyberspace&#8212;What's the Connection?&quot;</A>
gave evidence to that fact; Seattle is the home city of two community
networks and a range of access centers from
 the <A HREF="http://www.urbanleague.org/scripts/ulms_calannounce.cgi">Seattle Urban League</A>
to <A HREF="http://www.pan.ci.seattle.wa.us/COMMNTY/OVERVIEW.HTM" >
Project Compute</A>
at the Rainier Community Center to the <A HREF="http://www.speakeasy.net" >
Speakeasy Cafe</A>.

<P>
Whether intentional or not, where there are vital and active community
networks, there are also key community centers. Even in the very
small community of Taos, New Mexico (population 4,000+), where
LaPlaza Telecommunications hosted the community networking conference
in 1996, the LaPlaza Telecommunity Learning Center off the main
highway across from the WalMart includes an active 13 station
access and training facility along with its bank of modems and
telecommunications equipment. In Taos Pueblo there are remarkable
community labs in the school and at the Head Start center. Access
at the library has grown, the health center has a five-terminal lab,
the San Cristobal Resource Center thirteen miles north opened
a new three-station lab this summer, and there are plans for more
(<A 
HREF="http://www.laplaza.org/about_lap/network/public_access.html#tlc">http://www.laplaza.org/about_lap/network/public_access.html#tlc</A>).

<P>
Community networks and community technology centers have very
different origins, but it is not accidental that their developments
are now taking place in tandem. Those committed to community networking
appreciate the value of center-based access as the key approach
for providing technology to people who are generally without access,
skills, and opportunities to use it. No matter how friendly the
user interface, how many modems a community network has, or how
useful its information, in order to reach those most in need,
the training, support and physical access provided by community
centers are crucial.
<P>
Likewise, those involved with center-based technology access and
programming are appreciating more and more the importance of online
communications and resources. For these centers, telecommunications
is becoming an application as basic as word processing, databases,
spreadsheets, graphics, and desktop publishing. To take full advantage
of these resources, centers need to provide participants as well
as staff with individual email accounts, as much high speed connectivity
and multimedia capacity as possible, links to appropriate web
sites, and the ability to find these sites and develop and publish
original content.
<P>
These are developments being recognized by the <A HREF="index.html" >Community Technology Centers' Network (CTCNet)</A>,
a national support project and membership organization for 250
community-based organizations with technology access programs,
where tens of thousands of people who would not otherwise have
access to current technology find a convenient and welcoming place
to discover, explore, and receive training and support. 
<P>
CTCNet affiliates include settlement houses, museums, libraries,
public and subsidized housing developments, stand-alone centers,
and after-school, literacy, arts, and social service programs;
they support agencies for the homeless, the mentally and physically-disabled,
ex-offenders, and children of alcohol and substance abusers&#8212;a 
range that vividly demonstrates the Network's potential for
reaching those who would otherwise lack access to computers and
the Internet.
<P>
Community networks are <A HREF="http://www.ctcnet.org/frames.html" >joining CTCNet in growing numbers, too</A>,
from the <A HREF="http://www.innercitynet.org" >Inner City Net</A>
in San Diego to the <A HREF="http://www.n2r.net" >Net at Two Rivers</A>
in Sacramento to the <A HREF="http://www.seorf.ohiou.edu/~xx001/default2.html" >Appalachian Center for Economic Networks (ACENet)</A>
in Athens, OH to <A HREF="http://www.libertynet.org" >LibertyNet</A>
in Philadelphia. The <A HREF="http://www.austinfree.net" >Austin FreeNet</A>
is another excellent example of the synergy between community
networking and center-based access&#8212;through its 1997 CTCNet/Apple
partnership award, the FreeNet equipped the new <A HREF="http://www.ctcnet.org/austin.html" >East Austin Media Center</A>
with a computer lab.
<P>
In addition, <A HREF="http://www.pluggedin.org">Plugged In's EPANet</A>
in East Palo Alto and the <a href="http://hillhouse.ckp.edu/">Hill 
House Community Access Network</a>
in Pittsburgh represent center-based access programs establishing
community networks as part of their mission. The Community Action
Information Resource Network is a project of <A HREF="http://www.cairn.org" >Community Access</A>
in New York City, a multi-site, multi-service center and half-way
house/residence for people with psychiatric disabilities. The
MetroBoston <A HREF="http://www2.wgbh.org/mbcweis/mbcweishome.html" >CWEIS</A>
project is rooted in center-based adult education programs making
up the Literacy Telecommunications Collaborative. A growing number
of community cable public, educational, and governmental (PEG)
access centers especially are incorporating wider computer and
technology access with both center-based lab access and community
networking dimensions. Witness GrandNet out of the Community Media
Center in Grand Rapids, MI, and <A HREF="http://www.brooklynx.org" >Brooklynx</A>,
out of Brooklyn Access Community TV.
<P>
Hybridization is common. In northern Oregon, the <A 
HREF="http://www.columbia-center.org/home">Columbia Technology Center</A>
in St. Helens is also a nonprofit Internet Service Provider. It
is no easier to classify the <A HREF="http://www.clynx.org">CyberLynx</A>
Community Technology Centers of Coos &amp; Curry Counties, in
Bandon on the southern coast of the state. Such is the case, too,
with collaborative center-based programs supported by the RECA
Foundation and Columbia Basin Public Information Network/<A HREF="http://www.tcfn.org" >TriCounty FreeNet</A>
in Kennewick, WA.
<P>
Community technology centers provide a grounding for community
networking, a social technology laboratory to test out the possibilities
for reaching those most likely to be on the other side of the
technology gap, a place where evaluative criteria can be developed
and put to use in clear and meaningful ways. For community networkers,
such centers widen the conception of community, provide a bridge
to the inner-city, and create active political alliances.
<P>
There are currently struggles going on in many states to include
both community networks and a broad range of nonprofits with center-based
access in the establishment of universal service programs, to
go beyond the pipes and hardware for schools, libraries, and rural
heath centers that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has established.
The development of community networks and neighborhood centers
is not only an economically practical strategy on the road towards
universal access, it's an eminently sensible social and political
approach, too, strengthening and building local institutions that
are the foundation of democratic self-help and empowerment.
