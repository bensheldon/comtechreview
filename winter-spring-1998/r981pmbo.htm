in MetroBoston</FONT></B><br>

<P>
The metropolitan Boston area has one of the most extensive and
far-reaching networks of community technology centers in the entire 
country. Indeed,
the Boston area offers an international equity model of training
and support as well as access for the information have-nots. 
<BR>

<P>
In addition to the announced 13 new programs in the process of
being established at Boston's Community Centers (&quot;City Initiative
Puts Youths On-line,&quot; Mark Brunelli, <I>Boston Globe</I>,
July 24, 1997, p. B7)&#8212;one of Mayor Menino's initiatives in
this arena&#8212;there are no less than 45 additional centers with
community technology programs and public access throughout the
area, with a special emphasis on serving those ordinarily disenfranchised
from the benefits of emerging technology [<a href="bosctrs.htm">see map</a>]. Consider the following: <BR>

<P>
* The YM and <A HREF="http://www.yvc.org">YWCA</A>s in Dorchester
and downtown Boston on Huntington Avenue and Clarendon Street
and the Boys and Girls Club in Roxbury have exemplary programs.
Y's and Boys and Girls Clubs do not have such programs as a matter
of course. In addition, the Shelburne Computer Center in Roxbury,
the Harbor Point/Walter Denney Youth Center in Dorchester, and
Jobs for Youth all have computer programs especially for youth.
<BR>

<P>
* <A HREF="http://www.computerclubhouse.org">
The Computer Clubhouse at the Boston Computer Museum</A>
has been matching inner city youth with students and faculty
from MIT and elsewhere in an advanced program of technology access
including robotics, multimedia composition, and web page design.
The Harriet Tubman House/ United South End Settlements (USES)
is well into its second decade of technology access. A Clubhouse
program has also opened in USES in a second lab. <BR>

<P>
As the location and nature of some of these programs suggest,
technology access and support is not only for children. Many of
the community centers also serve adults, families, and seniors.
USES has videoconferencing capabilities, too. In the late 80's
its lab was not only providing an adjunct for its after-school
and kids programs, it was used for job training, providing open
public access, and collaborating with Project Place in providing
the center for a city-wide technology access and training program
for the Greater Boston Adult Shelter Alliance, before a number
of the shelters instituted their own programs. <BR>

<P>
The widespread distribution of community technology centers throughout
the area reflects a multi-racial, multi-ethnic outreach, too.
And in many instances programs are clustered to provide neighborhoods
with collaborative opportunities for multi-site access, training,
and support. Consider: <BR>

<P>
* In Chinatown alone, the Asian-American Resource Workshop, the
<A HREF="http://www2.wgbh.org/MBCWEIS/LTC/AACA/aaca.html">Asian-American Civic Association (AACA),</A>
<A HREF="http://www2.wgbh.org/MBCWEIS/LTC/QSCC/QSCC.html">and Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center (formerly the Quincy Community School) Adult ESL Program </A>all
have technology programs. <BR>

<P>
* The Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts has just opened a
major computer center in Dudley Square where there are also technology
access program at the Roxbury Boys and Girls Club, the Dudley
branch of the Boston Public Library, and Cruz Management's HUD
Neighborhood Networks Community Center. La Alianza Hispana, the
H.B. Cooper Community Center, Roxbury Presbyterian Church, and
the Veterans Benefits Clearinghouse all recently participated
in an organizational meeting for Dudley Area Technology Access
(DATA) with outreach to the Mandela Computer Learning Center,
the South End Technology Center at Tent City, WAITT House, and
the Roxbury Family Branch of the YMCA, all of which have technology
education and access programs in various states of development.
Mel King, the chair of the MIT Community Fellows program for many
years, among his other accomplishments, is a leading figure at
the Tent City project, where TecsChange runs a major recycling
program and provides equipment and technical assistance to Latino
groups locally and to Central and South America. The Dudley Street
Neighborhood Initiative (DSNI), through support by the Annie E.
Casey Foundation's Rebuilding Community Initiative, is in the
midst of developing substantial technology resources. <A HREF="http://www.codman.org">The Codman Square Health Center</A>
is developing a major technology program with a youth entrepreneur
component to supplement its civic health project.<BR>

<P>
* <A HREF="http://www2.wgbh.org/MBCWEIS/LTC/ElCentro/ElCentroHomePage1.html">El Centro del Cardenal in the South End</A>,
the Haitian Multi-Service Center in Dorchester, the <A HREF="http://www.channel1.com/users/bosphoto">Boston Photo Collaborative in Jamaica Plain</A>,
the Notre Dame and Condon Community Centers in South Boston, the
Kennedy Resource Center in Charlestown, and ROCA in Chelsea all
have computer access facilities as complements to their on-going
community programs. Jewish Community Housing for the Elderly and
Jewish Vocational Services at Camelot Court in Brighton are among
housing developments that have established lab facilities. <A HREF="http://www.vw.org/">Virtually Wired</A>,
a public access Internet center especially established for low-income
people in downtown Boston, has received new life through a partnership
with ABCD and is currently doing a series of programs on Boston
Neighborhood Network's community cable access channel.<BR>

<P>
Nor are these development restricted to the City of Boston proper.
<BR>

<P>
* The <A HREF="http://www2.wgbh.org/MBCWEIS/LTC/SCCC/sccc.html">Somerville Community Computing Center (SCCC)</A>,
located in the Somerville Community Service Center near Davis
Square, is the main technology facility for the city's Council
on Aging, Community Schools, Head Start, and Adult Education programs,
and provided the lab for the Powderhouse elementary school next
door until it donated a lab of equipment directly to the school.
The SCCC has operated for a number of years with the support of
Community Technology VISTA volunteers and has provided technology
training for VISTAs across New England. Years ago Boston Computer
Society volunteers were teaching animation on the center's Amiga
computers and the videos were taken to Union Square at the other
end of town where they were shown on Somerville Community Access
Television. The SCCC has run collaborative projects with the public
library, local housing projects and child care programs well as
SCAT since its establishment in the late 80's. Short Stop Youth
Shelter and the Boys and Girls Club in Somerville also have computer
labs. <BR>

<P>
* The Cambridge Public Library received an Apple Libraries of
Tomorrow equipment and Internet grant to develop one of the earliest
public access Internet library programs in the country. Cambridge
Community Television (CCTV) in Central Square boasts a computer
access center which specializes in, among other things, family
literacy. CCTV's work complements that of the Community Learning
Center on the other side of Central Square, and the nearby Margaret
Fuller Neighborhood House has recently expanded its computer lab
which has moved down from the 3rd floor into more spacious first
floor quarters. The Cambridge Housing Authority is well along
in opening the first of two public housing labs at Jefferson Park
and Newtowne Court.<BR>

<P>
* Malden Access Television, another community cable public, educational,
and governmental (PEG) access center expanding and integrating
converging technologies, has provided basic Internet training
for teachers in the Malden School system as well as access and
training at its main center. This year they've opened up a second
computer center in conjunction with the Newland St. housing development
in partnership with the City.<BR>

<P>
* The Watertown Housing Authority has set up two computer learning
centers, at Willow Park and Lexington Gardens. <BR>

<P>
These examples reflect the growing awareness among public officials
of the importance of community technology facilities. On the other
hand, private sector involvement&#8212;and that of the large and
prestigious educational institutions in the area&#8212;has been
minimal. Support from the corporate technology Route 128 belt&#8212;as
substantial as Silicon Valley or the corporate technology centers
in Texas, North Carolina, Washington, and elsewhere&#8212;is more
indirect than direct, with one major exception. The Lotus Development
Corporation, headquartered in Cambridge, has been especially helpful
in assisting these centers through grants of financial support
and software for many years. When corporate philanthropy and community
involvement is developed, we might expect community technology
in MetroBoston to take another giant leap forward. And there are
some good opportunities for this to happen.<BR>

<P>
With the closing of the Boston Computer Society, the country's
largest computer users group, staff members of the BCS public
service and nonprofit assistance programs are now running neighborhood
centers. Former BCS volunteers continue to be active in the area,
largely through these neighborhood programs. Perhaps the recently-formed
Boston Computer Foundation will be able to tap some of the previous
BCS corporate and individual support for community technology
efforts. In the meanwhile, ongoing collaborating resources include:
<BR>

<P>
* The Community Technology Centers' Network (CTCNet), a national
project funded by the National Science Foundation to assist community
organizations and nonprofits in the development of these programs,
located here at Education Development Center in Newton, has more
than 250 affiliated centers across the country, more than 40 of
which are located in the metropolitan Boston area and included
in the groups noted above.<BR>

<P>
* A number of programs have been working for years to use telecommunications
as a resource tool for adult literacy through the Literacy Telecommunications
Collaborative. This group of 15 adult ed centers is the heart
of a community-wide education and information service (CWEIS)
involving WGBH, CTCNet, and the Boston Adult Literacy Resource
Institute (check out <A HREF="http://www2.mbcweis.mbcweishome.html">http://www2.mbcweis.mbcweishome.html</A>).
MBCWEIS received its grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
to expand its work last summer and can be expected to grow. <BR>

<P>
* There are a myriad of other community technology resources to
complement and expand these efforts including the East-West Foundation;
the Nonprofit Computer Connection, one of many projects which
specializes in offering more general technical assistance and
training to area nonprofits; the Telecommunications Policy Roundtable-Northeast
(TPR-NE) which is the local public interest telecommunications
policy arm of a national effort; and the Center for Civic Networking,
which specializes in community networking projects. <BR>

<P>
In June of 1996, when Mayor Menino offered the welcome address
to the national Community Technology Centers' Network conference
held at Boston University, he endorsed a comprehensive plan to
fund computers in the neighborhoods through community technology
centers as well as in the classrooms and in libraries. The large
number of vital centers throughout the region gives vivid testimony
to the mayor's call for a broad-based institutional national movement
of education and access.
