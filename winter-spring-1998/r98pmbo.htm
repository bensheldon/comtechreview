<P>

The recent <i>Boston Globe</i> article on the City of Boston 
initiative to establish community computing centers (&quot;City Initiative Puts Youths On-line,&quot; Mark Brunelli, July 24, 1997, p. B7) 
did not capture the full extent to which the metropolitan area 
has one of the most extensive and far-reaching networks of 
such centers in the entire country.  Indeed, the Boston area 
offers an international equity model of training 
and support as well as access for the information have-nots. <P>

In addition to the announced 13 new centers in the process of 
being established&#8212;with five opening at the end of July and 
eight more slated for opening in the fall&#8212;there are at least 30 
additional centers with community technology programs and public access 
throughout the area, with a special emphasis on serving those 
ordinarily disenfranchised from the benefits of emerging technology.  
Consider the following:
<UL>

<LI>The YM and <A HREF="http://www.yvc.org" >YWCA</A>s in Dorchester and downtown Boston on Huntington Avenue and Clarendon Street and the Boys and Girls Club in Roxbury have exemplary programs. Y's and 
Boys and Girls Clubs do not have such programs as a 
matter of course.  In addition the Shelburne Timothy Smith 
Computer Center in 
Roxbury, the Harbor Point/Walter Denney Youth Center in 
Dorchester, 
and the Notre Dame Center in South Boston all have computer programs especially for kids.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.tcm.org/clubhouse/index.html" >
The Computer Clubhouse</A>
at the Boston Computer Museum has been matching up inner city 
youth with students and faculty from MIT and elsewhere in an 
advanced program of technology access including robotics, 
multimedia composition, and web page design.  The Harriet Tubman House/
United South End Settlements (USES) 
is well into its second decade of technology access.  
A Clubhouse program has also opened in USES recently in a second lab.
</UL>
<P>
As the location and nature of some of these programs suggest, 
technology access and support is not only for children.  Many of the community 
centers also serve adults, families, and seniors.
 USES has videoconferencing capabilities, too.  In the late 80's
its lab was not only providing an adjunct for its after-school
and kids programs, it was used for job training, providing
open public access, and collaborating with Project Place in providing
the center for a city-wide technology access and training program
for the Greater Boston Adult Shelter Alliance, before a number
of the shelters instituted their own programs.  
<P>
The widespread distribution of community technology centers throughout
the area reflects a multi-racial, multi-ethnic outreach, too.
Consider:
<UL>
<LI>In Chinatown alone, the Asian-American Resource 
Workshop, the <A HREF="http://www2.wgbh.org/MBCWEIS/LTC/AACA/aaca.html">
Asian-American Civic Association (AACA),</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www2.wgbh.org/MBCWEIS/LTC/QSCC/QSCC.html">Boston Chinatown 
Neighborhood Center Adult ESL Program</A> all have technology programs, as do 
<A HREF="http://ww2.wgbh.org/MBCWEIS/LTC/ElCentro/ElCentroHomePage1.html">
El Centro del Cardenal</A> and the Haitian Multi-Service 
Center.  The Urban League of Eastern 
Massachusetts is about to open a major computer 
center in Dudley Square, giving that area no less than four technology programs 
within a few blocks of each other.
<LI>The Boston Photo Collaborative in Jamaica Plain, 
the <A HREF="http://www.codman.org">Codman Square Health Center</a>, 
Cruz Management in Dudley Square, and the Kennedy Resource Center in 
Charlestown all have computer access facilities as complements 
to their on-going community programs.  
<A HREF="http://www.vw.org" >Virtually Wired,</A> a public 
access Internet center especially established for 
low-income people in downtown Boston, has received major attention 
since diminishing support has kept it on the 
edge, though it is still open and is even negotiating 
with ABCD to work out an arrangement to provide 
technology support to the large anti-poverty agency's 
programs and continue to serve its own constituency.
</UL>
<P>
Nor are these development restricted to the City of Boston proper.
<UL>

<LI>The <A
HREF="http://www2.wgbh.org/MBCWEIS/LTC/SCCC/sccc.html">Somerville
Community Computing Center (SCCC)</A>, located in the Somerville
Community Service Center near Davis Square, is the main
technology facility for the city's Council on Aging, Community
Schools, Head Start, and Adult Education programs, and provided
the lab for the Powderhouse elementary school next door until it
donated a lab of equipment directly to the school. 
 The SCCC has operated for a number of years with the support of
Community Technology VISTA volunteers and has provided technology training
for VISTAs across New England.  Years ago Boston Computer Society
volunteers were teaching animation on the center's Amiga
computers and the videos were taken to Union Square at the other
end of town where they were shown on Somerville Community Access
Television.  The SCCC has run collaborative projects with the
public library, local housing projects and child care programs
well as SCAT since its establishment in the late 80's.  Short
Stop Youth Shelter and the Boys and Girls Club in Somerville also
have computer labs. <LI>The Cambridge Public Library received an
Apple Libraries of the Future equipment and Internet grant a
couple of years ago. 
  Cambridge Community Television (CCTV), recently moved to
Central Square, boasts a computer access center which specializes
in, among other things, family literacy.  CCTV's work complements
that of the Cambridge Learning Center on the other side of
Central Square, and the nearby Margaret Fuller House has recently
expanded its computer lab which has moved down from the 3rd floor
into more spacious first floor quarters. <LI>Malden Access
Television, another community cable public, educational, and
governmental (PEG) access center expanding and integrating
converging technologies, has provided basic Internet training for
teachers in the Malden School system as well as access and
training at its main center.  This year they've opened up a
second computer center in conjunction with a local housing
development. <LI>The Watertown Housing Authority has set up two
centers in town, at Willow Park and Lexington Gardens. <LI>These
developments seem to offer some indication of the vitality of the
corporate technology Route 128 belt being as substantial as Silicon
Valley or the corporate technology centers in Texas, North
Carolina, Washington, and elsewhere.  The Lotus Development
Corporation, headquartered in Cambridge, has been especially
helpful in assisting these centers through grants of financial
support and software.  Yet technology philanthropy after Lotus is
represented by Apple and Microsoft more than locally-based
corporations, and the large and prestigious educational
institutions in the area have made little direct contribution.
</UL>

 <P> It is likely that the corporate technology influence is more
indirect than direct.  With the closing of the Boston Computer
Society, the country's largest computer users group, staff
members of the BCS public service and nonprofit assistance
programs are now running neighborhood centers.  Former BCS
volunteers continue to be active in the area, largely through
these neighborhood programs.  Moreover: <UL> <LI>The Community
Technology Centers' Network (CTCNet), a national project funded
by the National Science Foundation to assist community
organizations and nonprofits in the development of these
programs, is located here and has more than 250 affiliated
centers across the country, more than 30 of which are located in
the metropolitan Boston area. <LI>A number of these programs have
been working for years to use telecommunications as a resource
tool for Adult Literacy.  The Literacy Telecommunications
Collaborative is the heart of a community-wide education and
information service (CWEIS) involving WGBH, CTCNet, and the
Boston Adult Literacy Resource Institute (check out
http://www2.mbcweis.mbcweishome.html). MBCWEIS just received its grant
from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to expand its work.
<LI>There are a myriad of other community technology resources to
complement and expand these efforts including the East-West
Foundation whose recycling program has recently expanded and
taken on new partners; TecsChange, which provides special
assistance to Latino groups locally and to Central and South
America; the Nonprofit Computer Connection, one of many projects
which specializes in offering more general technical assistance
and training to area nonprofits; the Lotus Philanthropy
program also has an excellent nonprofit training component; the
Telecommunications Policy Roundtable-Northeast (TPR-NE) which is
the local public interest telecommunications policy arm of a
national effort; and the Center for Civic Networking, which
specializes in community networking projects.</UL>
<P>
In June of 1996, when Mayor Menino offered the
welcome address to the the national Community Technology Centers'
Network conference held at Boston University, he announced he was
filing a resolution with the U.S. Conference of Mayors that would
endorse a comprehensive plan to fund computers in the
neighborhoods through community technology centers as well as in
the classrooms and in libraries.  The large number of vital
centers throughout the region gives vivid testimony to what lies
behind the mayor's call for a national movement.
