In Carlos Casteneda's coming-of-spiritual-age novel <i>The Teachings
of Don Juan</i> (sometimes still placed in ethnographic research), 
the Yaqui Indian helps the author find his 'power spot' as part
of the rituals that lead to understanding and self-fulfillment.
<p>
In June 1997, I visited a 'power spot'&#8212;the CTCNet conference in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, an annual event for the loose confederation
of 200 community technology and learning centers. Several hundred
representatives from these centers came together for training,
the sharing of ideas, problems, and techniques, and to debate issues
relating to equity of access at the state, local, and national
level. <p>
CTCNet has a strong concentration of members from New York and
Boston, but it has spread to many other parts of the U.S. with
about 20% of the sites located west of the Mississippi. Most are
in urban areas and target children, the poor, and other groups
that have been underserved. Only a handful of sites are in small
towns, so the rural areas, which have a higher level of poverty
than the urban areas, are missing out or are served by groups
that have not yet joined the network.<p>
That seems to be the premise: that people who don't have the skills
to deal with the networked society will be left out, and the various
centers provide everything from help with resumes to PPP access
to help with high school equivalency exams and basic literacy
training on up to web page design classes.<p>
The opening session was a panel of Pittsburgh citizens involved
in a variety of city and county network and training initiatives
such as Common Knowledge, Information Renaissance, the library's
Electronic Information Network, the ominous sounding Department
of Justice program &quot;Weed and Seed&quot; and Hill House Community
Access Network. One member of the group said she felt as though
she were married to the others because they met so often before
different city fora to explain the networking activities going
on. While they spoke about technology projects, about economic
development, the real difference seemed to be that these people
from the city and school district were working together on a continual
basis. There was some indication that smaller groups in town were
reluctant to cede all their own power to receive funds and agree
to work under the mantle of the city or the school bureaucracy.
The speakers were obviously looking outward to make the connections
with other organizations in the community, to convince them that
alliances were in their best interest.<p>
During the Q&amp;A period some of the questioners voiced their
skepticism about the motivation of the corporate sector in becoming
involved in supporting the community networking initiatives. Mario
Zinga cited all the unfilled technology jobs as a reason that
business was supportive: they needed a larger labor pool. But
are these going to the desirable 'knowledge worker' positions
or just low level data entry clerk and digital burger flippers?
Marcia Snowden reminded the audience that they were trying to
make the whole town attractive to employers, not just have a better-trained
work force. <p>
The nature of the Net is such that the increased bandwidth in
more and more places allows companies to keep a core managerial
staff in one place, perhaps Pittsburgh, and have the other activities
distributed in offshore data havens, low cost manufacturing countries
in Asia and machiladoras along our border with Mexico, and outsourced
to other American firms in low wage areas away from Pittsburgh.
<p>
After the plenary we went to different panels and discussions
on topics such as public access cable, working with libraries,
finding money to keep community centers running, citizenship development,
and working with cities. My session on community networks had
about 50 minutes. Half of that time was spent learning more about
the Hill House Community Access Network which is selling PPP accounts
for $25 per year as part of the center's access program. That
fee covers use of the center as well as the account, and for $10/hour
members can receive computer training. Chrishelle Thomas-Eugene
conveyed a lot of excitement and drive that has helped make this
center a model for other ones in the city. However, they have
high expenses ($24,000 a year for a T1 line) so the reality of
making a business out of a community services would seem to be
her main challenge, considering how few paying accounts she had.
<p>
There were other sessions on asset mapping (see John McKnight
and John Kretzmann's Building Communities From The Inside Out
the Center for Urban Affairs at Northwestern University, 708 
491-3518) on GIS mapping for communities (HUD has software called
Community 2020 which has a relatively simple interface but lots
of arcane icons). <p>
Bart Decrem, director of Plugged In in East Palo Alto called a
special morning session that was very different. He raised the
issue of being ineffective (or being blamed) for being an outsider
when working in his community. In his case he's a white Belgian
working in a black area, and the audience broke up to share their
own experiences and some suggestions. It was very complex and
not at all predictable: how to deal with recent Asian immigrants
arriving with anti-Black prejudices, with parents who leave their
kids with older neighbors in Washington, DC and just never return,
with locals suspicious of do-gooders coming in for a quick help-and-run
session (NetDay being one example). Not that we solved many of
these tough problems, but many had never been voiced before in
a mixed audience.<p>
There were several sessions on policy and advocacy. Peter Miller
of CTCNet said it was not clear what direction policy work should
take, but they had an intern, Rainikka Corprew, working on this
for the summer. Barry Forbes of Alliance for Community Media gave
a couple of plugs for Sage Publications' <i>Public Radio and
Television in America</i> and how the vision of large amounts
of public space was whittled away or muted. Lauren-Glenn Davitian
urged people to collect stories to tell others, and I said story-tellers
were needed to simplify complex issues like the Telecomms Act
of 1996. One of the pamphlets being distributed was &quot;Internet
Jones&quot; a comic book that talked about access. It was reminiscent
of Cerfnet's &quot;Captain Internet&quot; comic book in the early
1990's.<p>
One site, www.lap.org, was working on developing &quot;Communityware&quot;,
but I have not investigated this collaborative software project.
A session on community-based research projects included a center
in a poor Appalachian neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio where there
was 27% unemployment, and they were studying the effects of having
free access and email.<p>
A plenary on setting the direction for CTCNet (which could not
depend on NSF money forever) was quite tense. A steering committee
had worked for a year on some guidelines and recommendations.
These were available by email, but many of the people in the audience
were not familiar with the issues and were being asked to make
decisions that afternoon. Many of them did not realize
how much work the steering committee had done, and some wanted
to send it back to the committee to re-do. However, it was clear
that the committee would not be willing to work on it another
year, and they held a vote, reminding the audience that it was
not cast in stone, and that setting up a framework could be changed
later. By a slim margin, the CTCNet members approved the plan.
There was a lot of discussion about regional groups, proportional
representation, racial makeup, etc. <p>
The group dynamics of virtual organizations are difficult. Some
people are members just for the services; others because they
want to be involved in projects with others, and another group
because they enjoy (or see the value in) organizational politics.
<p>
CTCNet decided to add some special interest groups: rural, disabled,
youth, intergenerational, and so on--but no SIG for community
networks. I'm not sure if that is an indication of the lack of
awareness or the feeling that they are not that pivotal in the
success of community technology centers.<p>
From the rapid growth of CTCNet and the statements by others who
planned on starting literally hundreds of sites just for HUD housing
projects does indicate that there could be thousands of community
technology centers in a few years. These seem to be a phenomenon
that will spread, quite apart from school-related computer training.
About 15% of the current members are public libraries, and I hope
that more libraries join. They need to rub elbows with other public
service agencies and community centers that are providing similar
services to overlapping clientele. I also hope that more rural
centers will join because they stand to benefit even more than
the urban centers whose personnel have an easier time of meeting
colleagues than do the more isolated sites in the countryside.
<p>
Following this conference I decided to visit some rural community
sites in the Appalachian part of West Virginia and Ohio as well
as a few people that were very cautious about the use of technology...
