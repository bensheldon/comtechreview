(Note: This article about RealVideo follows-up the RealAudio article
that appeared on page 45 of the Spring-Summer 1997 Community 
Technology Centers Review.
This series of articles describes how RealAudio and RealVideo
can allow the voices and images from CTCNet affiliates to travel
to interested individuals, organizations, and companies all around
the world. RealAudio and RealVideo are software programs created
by Real Networks. <A HREF="http://www.real.com" >http://www.real.com</A>)
<P>
RealAudio is an exciting software program for compressing sound
so that it can be delivered over the web, or as relatively small
files on floppy disks, Zip disks and CD-ROMs. When I first heard
about RealVideo, the follow-up to RealAudio, I wondered whether
it could deliver on its promise. Having used RealVideo for
several months now, I can attest that RealVideo is every bit as miraculous
and useful as RealAudio.
<P>
First, I ought to point out that RealAudio and RealVideo software
require at least a Pentium or Power Mac computer. (There are a
few notable&#8212;but convoluted&#8212;exceptions to this requirement.
I haven't been able to find any easy way to run RealAudio or
RealVideo on earlier computers.)
<P>
The power of RealVideo came alive for me in July, 1997, when a
colleague, John Rosenthal, asked me to videotape the television
news story of a press conference being held by the National Urban
Internet&#8212;an organization doing excellent work getting donated
computers for public&#8212;housing sites around Washington, DC.
<P>
Channel 5 (Fox) did a wonderful job of covering this event. Their
crisply delivered news story inspired me to create a RealVideo
movie. Knowing how small RealAudio files can be, I had a hunch
that I might be able to compress this 4-minute video clip to fit
onto a single floppy disk. Lo and behold, my hunch proved true.
<P>
For others who might wish to create RealVideo movies, here are
the basic steps. The process is straightforward for those with
strong general computer skills. I performed the following steps
on my Power Mac. (You would perform similar steps on a Pentium.)
<P>
The first step is to download the free RealVideo Encoder software
from the Real Networks web page. You can use Netscape or Internet
Explorer to perform the download from <A HREF="http://www.real.com" >http://www.real.com</A>
<P>
The second step is to digitize your video source to create a Quicktime
(Mac) or AVI (Windows) movie. I used an Apple TV Tuner/Video Input
card on my Power Mac. This card (actually 2 cards) sells for about
$80 to $110, can can be installed as easily as installing RAM.
As they say, &quot;Easy enough that an adult can do it.&quot;
&lt;grin&gt;
<P>
You can use the Apple Video Input card to play video from any
source on your Mac's screen. The source can be a VCR, a camcorder
or live television from the Apple TV Tuner card. Just hook up
your video source (via either RCA connectors, or S-Video and RCA-audio
connectors) to your Video Input card, and you're off and going.
<P>
I used the Apple Video Player software that came with my Performa
6360 to digitize the video clip from Channel 5 news. I clicked
on &quot;Record,&quot; right underneath the &quot;Capture Movie&quot;
part of the &quot;Controls&quot; screen, to digitize the movie
that was playing on my screen. In about 15 minutes I had a 35 meg
Quicktime movie on my hard drive. (I chose the smallest screen
size for the movie, 160 x 120 pixels, so that the 4-minute RealVideo
movie could have a fighting chance of fitting onto a floppy disk.)
<P>
Then I &quot;encoded&quot; (or compressed) the movie. The 35 meg
Quicktime movie on my hard drive would be the &quot;source&quot;
movie in this compression process. The very small (about one meg)
compressed RealVideo movie would be the &quot;destination&quot;
movie.
<P>
I started the RealVideo Encoder software and chose &quot;Open&quot;
from the File menu. I then chose &quot;Add&quot; and navigated
around my hard drive to find the Quicktime file I wanted to encode.
After choosing the Quicktime movie, I clicked on the &quot;Select&quot;
button to create a name of the &quot;destination&quot; RealVideo
movie. All RealVideo movies have a suffix of &quot;rm&quot; (standing
for RealMedia), so any file name you choose is fine as long as
it ends with a period and an &quot;rm&quot; suffix (without the
quotation marks).
<P>
Choose a file name for your &quot;destination&quot; movie, and
then click on &quot;Save.&quot; (This file name can always be
changed later.)
<P>
Here's where the fun begins. The RealVideo Encoder software gives
you many choices for how much you want to compress your movie.
You can compress your movie to a very small file size, but it
would look and sound grainy. In my experiments, I've developed
a fondness for what is called &quot;LAN 250&quot; compression.
This compression setting gives good sound and picture, while at
the same time making small movie files.
<P>
The key to the RealVideo treasure chest, in my view, is the choice
of &quot;frame rates,&quot; which is a slide-bar setting at the
bottom of the screen when you double click on LAN 250 (or any
of the other &quot;advanced settings.&quot;) I've gotten the best
results by choosing a frame rate of .20 to .40 frames per second.
(Note the small decimal before .20 and .40.) This setting gives
me a &quot;slideshow&quot; movie with frames that change every
5 seconds, or every 2.5 seconds.
<P>
Interestingly, the faster frame rates of one frame per second,
or 5 frames per second, can annoy the eye. A slower frame rate
not only makes smaller RealVideo files, the smaller files are
easier on the eyes.
<P>
After you've chosen your frames per second, click on the &quot;Save&quot;
button. On my Power Mac it takes about 5 seconds for the computer
to save these settings. Only then can you move on to the next
step. After the settings are saved, click on &quot;Close.&quot;
<P>
Click on the &quot;start&quot; button to start encoding your movie.
A rough rule of thumb is that encoding a movie takes anywhere
from 4 to 20 minutes. (Encoding a movie can take over an hour
if you're encoding a large movie at the fastest frame rate.)
<P>
When the movie has finished encoding, a screen will appear on
your screen saying so. This screen will give you some statistics
about the encoding process. The statistics are not too relevant
to anything, but you can impress people by looking over the numbers
and nodding your head wisely, saying, &quot;Hmmmm, very, very
interesting.&quot;
<P>
At this point you can hastily quit the RealVideo Encoder program,
and rush over to the folder where your Quicktime source movie
is located. Opening the folder will show you a file with the sweetest
little RealVideo movie you could ever imagine. If the free RealMedia
Player software has been installed on your computer, you can double
click on the RealVideo file, and sit back to enjoy your handiwork.
<P>
If, perchance, the RealVideo movie you create is slightly too
big to fit on a floppy disk (1.3 megs), you can easily go back
and re-encode the movie at a slower frame rate. You do have to
experiment a bit to come up with RealVideo movies that make people
want to stand up and applaud. But if your source video has good
lighting and clear sound, your RealVideo movie ought to look and
sound good, too.
<P>
Having tasted early success in creating RealVideo movies, I'm
ready to tackle more challenging RealVideo projects. My next project
involves finding a way to fit all 4 hours of Dr. Zhivago onto
a double density floppy disk. It's going to be a bit tight, but
I think I can squeeze it in. &lt;grin&gt;
<P>

Steve Ronan, at the CTCNet national office, has recently uploaded
<a href="aam97vid.htm">some RealVideo movies and slide 
shows featuring CTC Directors</a> to the CTCNet web page. Also, I plan
to include several RealVideo movies on the upcoming CTCNet CD-ROM.
If you follow the RealVideo creation steps described above, a
single CD-ROM disk can hold as much as 40 hours of RealVideo movies.
(Each meg of disk space holding about 4 minutes of movie. A CD-ROM
can hold 650 megs.)
<P>
Heartfelt thanks are owed to Alfred (Alf) Bawcombe and Miles Fawcett
at Interactive Applications (iapps), a web solution company in
Washington, DC, for introducing me to RealAudio and RealVideo&#8212;and 
for encouraging me to discover how these programs can be
best put to use. alf@iapps.com and miles@iapps.com
<P>
And thanks are owed to everyone at the One World Media Center,
who gave me free rein to experiment with RealAudio and RealVideo
on the Power Mac and Pentium computers at their nonprofit video
training facility in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington,
DC. <A HREF="http://www.owmc.org/" >http://www.owmc.org/</A>
