<P>
We have all heard of libraries that house computer centers. How
about neighborhood computer centers that become libraries? The
Dayton, Ohio Edgenet and Otterbein computer centers, along with
the Ohio Community Computing Center Network, have embarked on
an exciting partnership with the Dayton and Montgomery County
Public Library and the Library and Community Technology Access
Project. Federal Library Services Construction Act funds from
the state library of Ohio will be used to hire a full-time librarian
to work half-time at each center.
<P>
The goals of the project are simple: expand access to technology
and training in the Edgemont and Otterbein neighborhoods; enhance
library services in these neighborhoods; and provide a model for
library and community organization collaboration.
<P>
National reports have clearly demonstrated the gap that exists
in access to computer technology and telecommunications. Statistics
cited in the U.S. Department of Commerce report <i>Falling Through
the Net</i> show that information have-nots are disproportionately
found in our country's central cities, and that income is a clear
indicator as to whether a household has a computer. For example:
<P>
7.6% of central city residents with household incomes of less
than $10,000 have computers, while almost two-thirds of households
earning $75,000 or more annually have computers.
<P>
On the basis of race, black households in central cities have the
lowest percentage of computers in the home.
<P>
This report also identified the &quot;pivotal role to be assumed
in the new electronic age by the traditional providers of information
access for the general public&#8212;public schools, libraries and
other community access centers,&quot; and the need for these organizations
to work together. 
<P>
Library services to be provided as part of this project include
Internet training, training on use of the library's electronic
databases and CD-ROMs, and well as providing general information
on the library's resources and how to use them. These services
will be in addition to the general technology and computer training
already being provided at Edgemont and Otterbein.
<P>
The neighborhoods targeted for this project, the Edgemont neighborhood
on Dayton's near west side, and Twin Towers, the neighborhood
around Otterbein United Methodist Church on Dayton's near east
side, clearly are at-risk in the area of access to technology,
information and training. Neither neighborhood has a library branch
within easy walking distance, targeted to that neighborhood. In
addition, in the Edgemont neighborhood, which is 97% African-American:

<UL>
<LI>43% of its residents fall below the poverty level
<LI>28% lack a high-school diploma
<LI>Median household income is $13,412, compared to $19,779 for
Dayton
</UL>

<P>
In the Twin Towers neighborhood:
<UL>
<LI>The poverty rate is between 25-35%, and surrounding neighborhoods
have an even higher poverty rate of 35% and more. 
<LI>33% lack a high-school diploma 
<LI>Median household income is $14,756, compared with $19,779
for Dayton.
</UL>

<P>
The hoped for result is that residents of the two targeted neighborhoods,
Edgemont and Otterbein, will have easy, affordable access to expanded
computer technology and telecommunications training. While some
training is currently taking place, the partnership between the
centers and the library will provide added services.
<P>
Another anticipated outcome of this project is that people in
the Edgemont and Otterbein neighborhoods will become more familiar
with library resources, as well as becoming more likely to take
advantage of the resources available at library branches.
<P>
Finally, the project will provide a model of &quot;lessons learned&quot;
for other library/community organizations around the state, as
they seek ways to partner in joint library/community organization
technology projects.
