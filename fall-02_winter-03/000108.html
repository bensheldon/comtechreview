<div class="category_title">Summer Camp in Columbia, SC: Community Style</div> <span class="posted">by Dedria Albritton</span>




<p><table width=260 height=159 align=left><tr><td><img src="/fall-02_winter-03/img/allbrittonpctcelebrate.jpg" width="220" height="159" align="center" alt="Celebration"></td></tr></table></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/stories/v2/15.html" target="_blank">Fast 
    Forward</a> is a community technology center housed at <a href="http://hornet.richlandone.org" target="_blank">Hand 
    Middle School</a> in Columbia, South Carolina.&nbsp; In its three years, Fast 
    Forward has developed a reputation for quality summer camps for children. 
    Each year, the demand has increased, although federal funding has decreased. 
    In 2001, Fast Forward had 240 seats in the summer camps for 5-8<sup>th</sup> 
    graders and waiting lists of up to 10 children for each 20-student summer 
    camp last year. We had to find a way to serve more children. 
<table width=320 height=180 align=right><tr><td><img src="/fall-02_winter-03/img/PI_Hula_5.jpg" width="288" height="180" align="right"></td></tr></table></p>
  <p>With a dream of increasing the number of seats in our summer camps by 100, 
    planning began in June 2001. The first hurdle was how to transform a lab with 
    24 computers and 12 laptops into space for 340 children. The first resource 
    to come through was Hand Middle School. Administrators had an extra lab and 
    two classrooms available. </p>
  <p><table width=325 height=136 align=right><tr><td><img src="/fall-02_winter-03/img/Robotics_Group_3.jpg" width="288" height="136" align="right"></td></tr></table></p>
<p>An 
    experiment in the summer of 2001, using a high school senior to teach a keyboarding 
    class, gave Fast Forward the possibility of creating a corps of teachers from 
    the local high school. Dreher High School came through with ten juniors and 
    seniors who were willing to train and teach for the summer. In addition, our 
    pool of 16 youth volunteers (5-8<sup>th</sup> graders) swelled to 28.&nbsp; 
    Each youth was willing to work all year and volunteer all summer. Some youth 
    volunteers gave over 300 hours in seven weeks.</p>
  <p>More problems solved: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Snacks for each camper, volunteer, and teacher were a 
      substantial expense. Piggly Wiggly, a local grocery store, allowed us to 
      purchase everything at cost and stored the snacks for us&#151;3,000 juice 
      boxes, 10,000 cookies, and 30 pounds of pretzels. 
  </li>
  <li>
    After-camp care has always been a problem; camps end 
      at 12:00 noon.&nbsp; A meeting with the City Parks and Recreation Department 
      supplied the answer. The City agreed to provide after-camp care at the park 
      across the street until 6:00 p.m. at $20 per week per child. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    Fast Forward needed scholarships for students who could 
      not afford the $35 fee. Local businesses and individuals came through with 
      scholarships for the students.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <i><a
href="http://www.pcteachit.com/" target="_blank">PC Teach It</a> </i>magazine, 
      headquartered in Columbia, provided the supplies for the <i>PC Teach It</i> 
      Camp, along with incentive gifts for students and art and craft supplies 
      for after-camp care at the park.
  </li>
  <li> 
    East Coast Special Tees gave t-shirts for the price of 
      the freight when our donated t-shirts turned out to be the wrong size.
  </li>
  <li> 
    Fridays were celebration days. Parents were invited to 
      a Popsicle Party at 11:30 a.m. to see the accomplishments of the week. Some 
      children had no one to come. A call to Shandon Presbyterian Church produced 
      volunteers who came every Friday to celebrate with students who had no one 
      with whom to share.
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>Our summer camp schedule was published in April 2002, and seventy percent 
    of the classes were full by the second week. We added <i>more</i> camps&#151;480 
    seats would be available in seven weeks (plus 220 seats for adults -- 700 
    in seven weeks).&nbsp; Sixty to eighty children from every walk of life, every 
    financial background, and every neighborhood joined together each week.&nbsp; 
    Through special funding, a bus brought children from one of the most impoverished 
    areas of Columbia for two weeks of camp. Every zip code in Columbia was represented.</p>

<p>Children with special needs, home-schooled children, children with learning disabilities, 
    children from the best neighborhoods in town, children from neighborhoods 
    most people would be afraid to enter all worked together in teams to build 
    robots and make movies. They learned keyboarding and created projects in <i>PC 
    Teach It</i> Camp.</p>
  <p>When a community comes 
    together, anything can happen.&nbsp; It did in Columbia, South Carolina this 
    summer. It can in your community, too. </p>
