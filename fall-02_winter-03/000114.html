<div class="category_title">Sweet, Sweet $ustainability</div> <span class="posted">by Ken Thompson</span>




<p>My work brings me into contact with hundreds of Washington State-based community 
    technology programs (&quot;CTPs&quot;), and they are all working on serious 
    sustainability issues. I work on the <a
href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/cat" target="_blank">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates 
    Foundation's Community Access to Technology (CAT) Program</a>, and as such, 
    I represent an impermanent step on the path to sustainability.&nbsp; With 
    each proposal, however, would-be grantees and I both wrestle with issues of 
    long-term sustainability.&nbsp; What will make an organization's technology 
    project sustainable in the long term? The jury is still out. Actually, I'm 
    not even sure they've seen all the evidence yet.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Centers or Programs?</span>
  <p>As this field matures, sustainability is certainly one of the questions of 
    the day. In many ways, it begs another question&#151;what is the long-term 
    purpose of community technology programs? Like dentists encouraging everyone 
    to brush and floss, should they be trying to put themselves out of business 
    by eliminating the problem they are there to address? Or will CTPs always 
    be with us, dealing with the changing ranks of the digitally divided, and 
    the changing nature of technology?</p>
  <p>My feeling is that nonprofit-run technology programs will be with us for 
    some time, if not effectively forever. I'm less sure about the fates of &quot;stand 
    alone&quot; CTCs. In Washington State, where CAT does all its grantmaking, 
    very few community technology programs are run out of organizations that have 
    a mission built around technology access, and I don't suspect the national 
    scene is much different. Of the 50 or so grantees of CAT, only two or three 
    are CTCNet members. In other words, a CTCNet membership does not seem pertinent 
    to the vast majority of CTPs out there. In my experience, the vast majority 
    of CTPs work with an organization's specific client set, rather than being 
    open to the public at large. This, plus not seeing their organization's mission 
    as being &quot;about technology,&quot; and certainly not thinking of themselves 
    as a &quot;technology center,&quot; all distance them from CTCNet.&nbsp; This 
    is a shame, since there would be much for them to gain from membership.&nbsp; 
    If CTCNet could morph into something useful to these organizations, CTCNet 
    could be a meaningful player in making CTPs sustainable. At present, it is 
    not.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Plan A</span>
  <p>Working on the assumption that most technology programs are part of larger 
    (non-technology oriented) organizations, the basic philosophy should be that 
    technology costs need to be thought of as just one line item in the general 
    operations budget of an organization, not a &quot;special project&quot; cost.&nbsp; 
    As such, making CTPs sustainable is really no different than any exercise 
    in nonprofit sustainability. You need an effective fundraising plan and diversified 
    sources of income. If humanly possible, you need to make your organization 
    or program entirely non-dependent on fickle grantmakers. I estimate that there 
    are only a few years left where most private grantmakers will be seduced by 
    the allure of &quot;technology projects&quot; &#151;expect fundraising to 
    get a lot harder if you are basing your argument for funding primarily on 
    technology access in the years ahead.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Blah, Blah, Blah</span>
  <p>All the standard methods of promoting sustainability are covered in some 
    depth in the City of Seattle's &quot;<a
href="http://www.cityofseattle.net/tech/ctc/default.htm" target="_blank">Sustainability 
    Strategies for Community Technology Centers in Seattle</a>,&quot; authored 
    by the Environmental Health and Social Policy Center. Not to knock this report 
    unduly (it is a workman-like recitation of all the elements that would help 
    to make any nonprofit sustainable), but for the most part it fails to meet 
    its own goals of &quot;finding strategies that will help place...CTCs on a 
    path to sustainable operations&quot; and in finding whether &quot;strategies 
    that work at one CTC (can) be successfully applied by others.&quot; Unless 
    you have been operating a technology center under a rock for the past ten 
    years, nothing much in this report will surprise you (however, if you are 
    just thinking of starting a CTP, this report is a great primer on common issues 
    and well-known broad strategies for survival). </p>
  <p><br>
    Likewise, Industry Canada's report on &quot;<a
href="http://www.ecommons.ca/stage/main.phtml?css=100&amp;section=research&amp;show=cap" target="_blank">A 
    Picture of the Community Access Program of Industry Canada</a> <a
name="_Hlt23057116"></a><a name="_Hlt23057178"></a><a name="_Hlt23057196"></a><a
name="_Hlt23057150"></a><a name="_Hlt23057006"></a><a name="_Hlt23057073"></a><a
name="_Hlt23057001"></a> &quot; tries to address the issue of sustainability head 
    on. Many of the conclusions they reach echo the Seattle report on best practices 
    towards generic sustainability: community buy-in and participation, serving 
    local needs, leadership, partnerships, and effective marketing, to name a 
    few.&nbsp; </p>
  <span class="subhead">The (Un)Holy Grail&#151;Cash</span>
  <p>What I keep hoping that I will find in these reports are studies showing 
    specific effective non-grants-based strategies for keeping your CTP going. 
    Alas, this is not there. At the last CTCNet Conference there was some talk 
    of trying to develop a research agenda for the field. If this is realized, 
    I sincerely hope that <i>useful</i> sustainability research will be on the 
    agenda.&nbsp; Given the lack of actual research to rely on, what follows are 
    my thoughts and musings on the subject. </p>
  <p>Substantial earned income needs to be the goal of every CTP&#151;this is 
    a trend in the nonprofit sector generally. If you think that commerce is evil, 
    get over it. Nothing says independence like your own income stream. The trick 
    is making it work with your mission. As such, there do seem to be some opportunities 
    for CTCs and CTPs to make a buck and do good at the same time. </p>
  <p>The Industry Canada report lists a few interesting examples: one CTC built 
    a digital recording studio into its center; another acts as a publishing center 
    for its host organization, putting out retail items like calendars, cookbooks, 
    and local history books; others design web pages for government and nonprofit 
    clients for a fee. Part of the key here is that they feel okay charging a 
    fee for enhanced services &#151;they don't feel obliged to give everything 
    away for free. The Seattle report also lists some fee-for-service concepts 
    that have been implemented: substantial class fees for high-end training curriculum; 
    a fee-based computer repair service, and sales of donated, refurbished computers.&nbsp; 
    I love these on-the-ground examples (no, your CTC/CTP doesn't have to become 
    a competitive ISP to survive), and more needs to be written about them.&nbsp; 
    Contact info for these projects is in the reports. Give 'em a call.</p>
  <p>Actuall<u>y</u> adding something to this area of inquiry is a recent Summit 
    Collaborative report called <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/ctctechprovreport.html" target="_blank">&quot;Community 
    Technology Centers as Technology Assistance Providers to Nonprofit &amp; Community 
    Based Organizations.&quot;</a> It profiles several technology organizations 
    that are looking to make money by providing technology consulting and other 
    services to other local nonprofits.&nbsp; While larger cities may already 
    have someone covering this area (<a href="http://www.npower.org" target="_blank">NPower</a> 
    would be one example of this sort of provider), most mid-size cities and smaller 
    towns do not have someone providing this service, opening up an on-mission 
    earned income opportunity for community technology organizations.</p>
  <p>We also need to be unafraid to learn from other nonprofit sectors. I just 
    picked up a new book by Andy Robinson called <i>Selling Social Change (Without 
    Selling Out</i>).&nbsp; I'm only on page 7, but he's already given one great 
    case study about a nonprofit that promotes bicycling as a transportation alternative. 
    They earn 100% of their annual $200,000 budget through earned income sources 
    such as full service (full-priced) repairs, lower-cost assisted self-repairs, 
    selling refurbished bikes from donated parts, and an innovative international 
    linkages program with Guatemala.&nbsp; Sound familiar?&nbsp; Is this the sort 
    of program that most CTCs/CTPs could run, but with computers instead of bikes? 
    You bet. [My apologies if there is already this exact program operational 
    out there. I have not heard of you yet.&nbsp; If you are making $200,000/year, 
    you should get the word out!]&nbsp; If you have not read it, you might also 
    check out Bill Shore's<i> The Cathedral Within</i> for some inspirational 
    stories on how some larger nonprofits have succeeded in a big way at the earned 
    income game. Shore lays out the institutional backing and will that needs 
    to be behind larger income-earning projects.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Take a Chance</span>
  <p>I don't mean to downplay entirely the other tactics that can be used to edge 
    toward sustainability. One I am seeing more and more are links with high school 
    or community college students for credit/volunteer opportunities, especially 
    around technical support issues and lab staffing.&nbsp; Innovative partnerships, 
    especially at the moment of program inception, can be particularly powerful.&nbsp; 
    A CAT grantee, <a
href="http://www.pnt.org/" target="_blank">the Pacific Northwest Trail Association</a>, 
    formulated their CTP in such a way that they had financial commitments secured 
    from every layer of government imaginable before launching their project (federal&#151;provides 
    transportation; state&#151;laid fiber for connectivity; school district&#151;donated 
    space) in exchange for access and services from PNTA. Now they are developing 
    an earned income enterprise based on growing and selling native plants for 
    environmental rehabilitation projects, facilitated in part by their computer 
    center.&nbsp; And no, they don't have a large staff or a million dollar budget, 
    they are, in fact, located in tiny Sedro-Wolley, Washington.&nbsp; Unlike 
    nearly every other funder on the planet, I do not think that partnerships 
    and &quot;leveraging&quot; are a long-term sustainability plan, even though 
    the PNW Trail Association story is a great one.</p>
  <p>For many years, I worked for a small nonprofit. I know that time and dollars 
    are short and tight in that environment, and it's not often easy to take a 
    chance. But some thought to on-the-ground earned income experimentation needs 
    to happen in the CTC/CTP space, and soon. And the word needs to get out, both 
    about successes and failures. If you are running a CTP, read the reports and 
    books I mentioned, and lobby CTCNet, or ACC, or someone, to produce useful 
    studies on replicable earned income projects. Mostly, do not wait for funders 
    to come to your rescue.&nbsp; Foundations are great at many things, but not 
    at covering the ongoing costs of running an organization, and they are not 
    renowned for their patience or decades-long commitments.&nbsp; As &quot;venture 
    philanthropy&quot; and other trends from the business world take hold more 
    firmly, expect funders to be looking for evidence and data on how you will 
    survive without them.</p>
