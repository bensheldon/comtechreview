<p>This 
    article shares the case study of one individual in her efforts to achieve 
    social and cultural resonance with technology. She is a participant 
    in the Creating Community Connections (C3) Project,* an ongoing effort at 
    <a
href="http://www.camfieldestates.net/" target="_blank">Camfield Estates</a>, a 
    predominantly African-American, low- to moderate-income housing development 
    in Roxbury, MA, since 1999. As part of this project, MIT researchers 
    worked with residents to establish a technological infrastructure by offering 
    every family a new computer, software, and high-speed Internet connection, 
    along with comprehensive training and a web-based community building system.</p>
  <span class="subhead">The Case Study of Edna Jackson</span>
  <p>Edna and James Jackson (both pseudonyms) arrived at the housing development 
    in 1990. For the next seven years leading up to the eventual demolition 
    of the property in 1997, their attachment to the neighborhood grew stronger 
    as the development became their home. In 1999, after renovation was 
    completed, the Jacksons enthusiastically decided to return to the development 
    given their longstanding ties to the community. However, their return 
    to the development was somewhat bittersweet as Edna was now battling chronic 
    obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a combination of emphysema (over-inflation 
    of the structures in the lungs leading to decreased respiratory function) 
    and chronic bronchitis (inflammation of the tubes connecting the windpipe 
    and the lungs that obstructs airflow), a disease that claims the lives of 
    approximately 100,000 Americans each year.</p>
  <p>Having been diagnosed with COPD three years earlier, Edna's days at the new 
    development would largely be confined to her residence. Now at age 57, 
    she relies on an oxygen machine to provide constant respiratory assistance 
    and uses a walker on the rare occasions when she leaves the house (usually 
    to go to the hospital).</p>
  <span class="subhead">Reluctance, Recruitment and Resonance</span>
  <p>From the onset, Edna was the project's staunchest opponent. When the 
    President of the tenants association first spoke with Edna, she flatly refused 
    the offer for the computer, Internet access, and home-based training. 
    Subsequent efforts by the President, a representative from the financier of 
    the property, and other residents at the development also fell upon deaf ears. 
    Meanwhile, the new computer intended for Edna sat in a corner of the community 
    center gathering dust. Eventually, Edna was convinced to allow someone 
    to set up the computer and Internet connection in her home, but only on a 
    trial basis.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left'>When we moved 
    back and this building was done and I heard that we were going to get computers, 
    I didn't care why. I didn't want one. And I told [them] I didn't 
    want one. I was really disgusted with it all.</p>
  <p>Rather quickly, the instructor was able to engage her. He did this 
    not by showing her how to use the mouse or the keyboard per se, but by clearly 
    demonstrating relevance. Initially this meant showing her how to connect 
    with family and friends, which struck a definite chord.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left'>I got my first 
    session and I was amazed! I couldn't believe it! It was so fascinating! 
    I get my second session and I'm getting e-mail, which was totally blowing 
    my mind. And I'm saying, "Oh my God, this is incredible."</p>
  <p><img src="/fall-02_winter-03/img/pinkett_camfield1.jpg" width="150" height="266" align="right" alt="C3 Project at Camfield Estates">With 
    each passing day, Edna became increasingly more comfortable with the computer. 
    However, the majority of her tasks still involved pointing and clicking. 
    Her first jaunt beyond e-mail, web sites, and games was participating in a 
    chat room on cancer (she is also a survivor of breast cancer). Given 
    her positive experiences thus far, she far she didn't hesitate entering the 
    chat room and "watching" the conversation take place among the participants. 
    In fact, her early experiences with chat rooms were characterized by watching 
    the conversations of others as she was reluctant to contribute to the dialog. 
    And then one day everything changed. A question was posted in the chat 
    room for which she knew the answer, and, slowly but surely, she found the 
    courage to post a response. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left'>So now I type 
    it in. It looked OK. And I sent it. I had the nerve. 
    It's like I was covering over my eyes. I was so afraid that someone 
    would say, "What's this jerk? Who's this jerk? What's she 
    talking about?" So now the person said, "Thanks Edna you cleared 
    that up." I was so happy I didn't know what to do! I got 
    up and I actually did a dance! You know when the football players do 
    a...when they get a touchdown? I got up and did a dance just like those 
    football players! When you are sick there is not much to celebrate.</p>
  <p>Edna soon found herself in various chat rooms on a regular basis. She 
    spent as many as nine hours per day on the computer and says, "I remember 
    one time our lights went out and the only thing I was interested in...I didn't 
    care about the food in the refrigerator, I wanted to be on the computer." 
    She began to see herself as an advisor, confidant, and sounding board for 
    others. She shared her thoughts about cancer, about COPD, and about 
    life. On making this transition from passive bystander to active contributor 
    she remarks, "It's so rewarding. And to be able to give...I'm not 
    only getting, I am giving because I can tell them my experiences."</p>

  <p>A cultural shift has taken place in the Jackson's household. Attitudes 
    have changed. Habits have changed. Ways of perceiving the world 
    have changed. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left'>I would have 
    never wanted a computer. I didn't see anything in it. Now I wouldn't 
    know what to do without it. I believe I am better physically and mentally 
    because of the computer.</p>
  <p>A social shift has also taken place. An environment that was once closed-off 
    to the outside world in certain ways has now been reopened. Connections 
    are being made that previously didn't exist and, in fact, weren't possible.</p>
  <p>After completing approximately ten sessions with her instructors, Edna had 
    to temporarily postpone their visits for health-related reasons. However, 
    that has not prevented her from continuing to explore new arenas. </p>
  <p>There are three competencies Edna has developed in her still embryonic exposure 
    to digital technologies. First, she has developed a sense of empowerment 
    as evidenced by her frequent references to having greater control of her life. 
    Second, she has developed a renewed faith in her capacity to learn. 
    Third, she has experienced a shift and transformation in her thinking with 
    respect to computers and the Internet. Whereas in the past she saw no 
    relationship between herself and these technologies due to unfamiliarity and 
    consternation, she is able to reflect on that experience and realize that, 
    now, the connection is very clear.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Community Technology and Community Building</span>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:left'>Community technology, 
    and in particular community building, are fundamentally local, shared social 
    and cultural processes. Edna Jackson's story is certainly one that incorporates 
    notions of community, but in a more distant sense as well. Her interactions 
    have largely been centered on a "community of interest" (i.e., cancer 
    survivors) as opposed to a "community of practice" (i.e., the housing 
    development), and her online activity has established global as well as neighborhood 
    ties (excluding family). Is the community better off as a result of 
    her experience? I reply with a resounding, "Yes."</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:left'>On one hand, Edna 
    has reached out to others in the community to the best of her ability. 
    On the other hand, the more important lesson is that the community reached 
    out to her. As a result of that outreach, Edna's and her husband's quality-of-life 
    have improved, and for that reason alone, the community has improved, too. 
    Her story demonstrates how technology can serve as a tool to break down walls, 
    open doors, and reinvigorate life. More importantly, her story illustrates 
    how the collective efforts of a community can open up new possibilities for 
    one of its longstanding members. Thanks to the consolidated efforts 
    of neighbors and caring staff at the development, one of the project's staunchest 
    opponents is now, quite possibly, its greatest proponent.</p>
