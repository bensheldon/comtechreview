<p><span class="subhead">Paradoxes 
    of Building of the Information Society in Russia and CIS </span>
  <p>The disintegration of the USSR still influences the world to a great extent. 
    The formation of a functioning civil society sector is needed to overcome 
    the effects of the ex-soviet (CIS) state economical, social and cultural heritage 
    of totalitarian government.&nbsp; It is crucial to effectively use information 
    and communication technologies (ICTs) for rapid improvement of the quality 
    of life of the ordinary people, of women, youth, the elderly, the disabled, 
    and the indigenous.</p>
  <p>The Internet and related technologies have developed rapidly across Russia 
    in the last 4-5 years. The country is at a crossroads as policymakers contemplate 
    how to regulate this powerful medium. While there are vast commercial, educational, 
    and societal benefits to the Internet, there are legitimate concerns regarding 
    the privacy and security of Russia's government and citizens.&nbsp; Like much 
    of the rest of the world, Russia is struggling with a great number of issues 
    and challenges posed by the Internet as a new medium of communication and 
    commercial development&#151;infrastructure and e-commerce, piracy and copyrights, 
    access to information and freedom of speech, and regulatory control and legislative 
    authority. However, Russia faces many unique technical, legal, and cultural 
    challenges to the successful development of an online society, too.</p>
  <p>While estimates vary, there appear to be between four to eight million regular 
    Internet users (the lower figure seems more realistic because in the country 
    there are only seven to eight million personal computers capable to work with 
    Internet programs and a significant number of them haven't connected to the 
    Net).&nbsp; It is realistic to estimate that about 1.5 to 2% of the Russian 
    population is online (compared, for instance, to 34% in Germany).&nbsp; It 
    is striking that about 38% of all Internet users in Russia live in Moscow.&nbsp; 
    This figure highlights the tremendous digital divide in our society. Also, 
    recent polls indicate that only 12% of Internet users are older than 45.</p>
  <p>The nation's IT sector accounts for little more than one-half of one percent 
    of the nation's economy. In an attempt to develop the IT sector in Russia, 
    the government recently initiated a $2.6 billion &quot;Electronic Russia&quot; 
    program, which focuses on developing the regulatory and legal environment, 
    Internet infrastructure, e-government, and e-education. It is the goal of 
    the program to increase the IT sector's influence to two percent of the economy 
    by 2010.&nbsp; While the program has the potential to boost the nation's economy, 
    provide distance-learning opportunities in remote regions, and develop Russia's 
    democratic government, the complete details of E-Russia's implementation are 
    still being determined.</p>
  <p>A separate but equally crucial issue is the use of ICTs and the Internet 
    for not-for-profit/civil society purposes.&nbsp; Last year, the Centre for 
    Community Networking and Information Policy Studies (CCNS) conducted a <a
href="http://www.communities.org.ru/public.htm" target="_blank">study on the use 
    of ICTs in non-governmental organizations in Saint Petersburg and Leningrad</a> 
    <a
name="_Hlt24010583"></a><a name="_Hlt24009507"></a><a name="_Hlt24009717"></a><a
name="_Hlt24009725"></a><a name="_Hlt24009493"></a> .&nbsp; Unfortunately only 
    seven percent of the NGOs in the region regularly use ICTs in their work, 
    and have email and web sites. In Russia only commercial Internet projects 
    develop because of a lack of effective state programs aimed at creation of 
    Internet centres for disabled people, low-income people and people living 
    in small provincial towns.&nbsp; </p>
  <span class="subhead"><img src="/fall-02_winter-03/img/COMTECH2.JPG" width="300" height="317" align="right">The 
    Role of Community Networking</span>
  <p>It is now commonplace to speak about the formation of the so-called &quot;informational 
    society&quot; in the economically developed countries. In December 2003 there 
    will be held a first World Summit of Information Society (WSIS) where a wide 
    spectrum of issues concerning human civilization at this new stage of its 
    development will be discussed.&nbsp; But the critical question must be: Whose 
    Information Society? Will it be the one that suits the elites but excludes 
    the majority? Or will it be one that provides and expands sustainability, 
    human rights, and people's dignity? </p>
  <p>At present, Internet access in Russia is available primarily in major cities 
    (at rates that are affordable to average users). Obviously, to bridge the 
    digital divide between Russia and other nations, the Internet must be used 
    in our country by more than just the elite. While there are many problems 
    in creating an online Russia, they break down into two fundamental challenges: 
    establishing a technical, economic, and legal environment that supports the 
    Internet and creating a cultural environment that embraces this inherently 
    transparent technology. </p>
  <p>Community networks (CNs) and Community Informatics (CI) as projects and methods 
    grew for most part within developed and western societies with related cultural, 
    social, economic and technology assumptions and an existing &quot;civil society&quot; 
    infrastructure of norms, values and institutional frameworks that can support 
    these types of services. In societies which for historical reasons have not 
    developed this civic infrastructure&#151;for example, Russia and other states 
    in transition&#151;the development of community-based ICT services such as 
    community networks is difficult.&nbsp; As we develop our ideas about community 
    networks and community informatics, we have begun to ask:&nbsp; &quot;How 
    can ICTs be used as effective tools for fostering self-organizing models of 
    governance in our region?&quot;</p>
  <p>The rebuilding of Russia involves revitalizing a sense of community economic 
    development and enabling local citizens to participate in local self-government/self-organization. 
    For a fully democratic society to emerge in Russia, local (geo)communities 
    (groups of people living within the same locality and united by common values) 
    need to play a greater role in public life.&nbsp; During the Soviet era, communities 
    were structured to a great extent around work places. In the current transition 
    period with most enterprises, institutes, and state farms being shut down 
    or experiencing dramatic cutbacks, there is a significant social vacuum at 
    the local level.&nbsp; Real community needs to become a basic structure unifying 
    socially active citizens who are endeavoring to achieve development for their 
    territory.&nbsp; Right now, there is a need for local communities to play 
    a greater role in public life and to develop networks across communities to 
    unify socially active citizens who are endeavoring to achieve regional development.</p>
  <p>We are sure that one of the main mechanisms for the development of civil 
    society in post-communist states is the transformation of &quot;neighbors&quot; 
    into &quot;neighborhoods&quot; formed by people of various social groups who 
    are nevertheless ready to work together to solve local problems important 
    for all of them. Under such conditions the work undertaken between and within 
    local communities is extremely important. </p>
  <span class="subhead">Lessons Learned in Early CN Experiments</span>
  <p>During the last four years the author has been working in several international 
    research and development projects in the field of civil society structures 
    development at the local level&nbsp;in Russia (Gardarika, UN Habitat Program, 
    The Democracy Works et al.) and saw some cases of very effective use of ICT 
    for creating a good &quot;social atmosphere&quot; within various geolocal 
    communities, establishing&nbsp;new social links, and developing working partnerships. 
    In our practical work we explored new ways and methods for local citizen participation 
    in the decision-making process at the local level, especially through the 
    use of ICTs. </p>
  <p><br>
    In particular, we used tools such as community web sites and small local access 
    centers.&nbsp; In spite of the relatively small percent of Internet-connected 
    local dwellers&nbsp;(most of those projects were implemented in small distant 
    towns and rural areas), a significant part of local residents were involved 
    in these activities.&nbsp; Interestingly, the so-called Soviet intelligentsia&#151;teachers, 
    doctors, and engineers, well-educated people of middle and older ages who 
    struggle to find their place in the new post-Soviet society&#151;appear to 
    form the potential base for Internet development in our region. </p>
  <p>It is clear that the new information technology environment is not only about 
    hardware&#151;wires, modems, servers, routers, etc.&#151;it is about how communities 
    provide access, computer literacy, and organizational training whilst at the 
    same time being aware of the related community development issues. The nature 
    of the information infrastructure, e.g., the content, structure, and relationships 
    among discrete information resources, providers and users is essential to 
    consider because of the degree that this infrastructure can assist in the 
    creation of a new public sphere, where democratic decision making and community 
    building is enhanced.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Approaching CN/CI Research and Development (R&amp;D)</span>
  <p>In regard to a given R&amp;D problem we consider structures of interaction, 
    stakeholders, and regional agents of development as well as ICT infrastructure 
    and capacity to send and receive reliable and objective information. In this 
    sense, the following scheme describes stages in our work developing ICT projects 
    in Russia:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Description of the project in a language accessible to 
      citizens, including possible ramifications of the project for the local 
      community;
  </li>
  <li>Definition of the key focal points of communication infrastructure 
      and stakeholders;
  </li>
  <li>Organization of dialogue, communicative and informational 
      events;
  </li>
  <li>Strengthening of positive trends in local communities;
  </li>
  <li>Organization of sustainable relationship between local 
      communities and regional ICT project developers.
  </li>
</ol>
  <p>In other words, communication projects should be viewed only as elements 
    of the communication infrastructure development of local communities as a 
    part of larger social projects.&nbsp; </p>
  <h3>The Importance of CN/CI Practice and Theory</h3>
  <p>The studies we have conducted so far suggest that if information networks 
    are seen only as the installation of computers and telecommunication facilities 
    without any analysis of the larger social meaning of these, these information 
    networks quickly die out or commercialize. That is why it is important to 
    develop these resources together with people who will use them. This is why 
    the practice and theory of community networks and community informatics is 
    important.</p>
  <p>We call it a principle of involvement. We must help all citizens to become 
    producers as well as consumers in the ICT economy. We realize that CN can 
    not be created on the same principles as traditional information channels 
    (mass media). New culture is being created now, new principles of information 
    interaction, where there is no difference between <br>
    &quot;journalists&quot; and &quot;readers.&quot; That is why even in early 
    stages of CN designing, community members should participate in the formation 
    of local contents of CN. This results in a double effect &#151;it both increases 
    effectiveness of CN work and turns citizens into co-authors of their own information. 
    Though at present development of CN in Russia depends on external financial 
    support (foreign charity funds, international programs), we are confident 
    that in the future we will be able to demonstrate the promise of these new 
    tools in the economic and social development of municipalities and regions.&nbsp; 
    Consequently, development of CN will become an item within Russian budgets.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Conclusion</span>
  <p>Development of such complex social ideas as community networking should be 
    based on substantial inner resources (training programs and sessions, professional 
    employees, methodology materials, and development models) as well as be politically 
    supported (legislation, federal social budgets, municipal orders) in order 
    to maintain national programs.</p>
  <p>Adaptations of models used in other countries will only be successful in 
    Russia if the environmental factors outlined above are accurately defined 
    and accounted for prior to implementation. It is essential to initially screen 
    external models for the adoption of ICT for community benefit against these 
    considerations and their related procedures, methods, and tools. </p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>Dear Mr. Stafeev,<br />
I have read your article with interest and found it relevant to try to approach you. I represent a non-profit think tank based in Copenhagen and London, but trying to build up a platform for &quot;social creation&quot; in Moscow. We are looking for partner organisations in Moscow, that could be interested in actually entering into the project in order to strengthen social creation networks aorund or in their organisational environment. The use of ICT is of course part of the project, though not its core (in DK, we are beginning to experiment with the use of very open web-fora like Wikis to further develop our methods into the ICT domain) - but it seems to me that many of your interests are similar to ours. With you being based in St. Petersburg, what I asking of you is not so much a partnership at this stage, but more likely names of organisations, think tanks, institutes, firms, that may be interesting for us to contact in view of a partnership. We are applying for a grant from the TACIS program this spring, so we are eager to find more interactive partners than the ones we already have as backing and board members.</p>

<p>This became a long mail - please forgive me for taking up your time, but I would really appreciate if you could help me on this issue - as you state, Russia is not exactly completely present on the web, so my knowledge is building up at a far too slow pace.</p>

<p>Hopeful and kind regards,</p>
