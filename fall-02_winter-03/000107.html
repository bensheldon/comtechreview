<div class="category_title">From The Children's Partnership: Strategies and Resources for Community Technology Practitioners</div> <span class="posted">by Laurie Lipper and Wendy Lazarus</span>




<p>The <a href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/" target="_blank">Children's 
    Partnership</a> (TCP) is a national child advocacy organization that undertakes 
    research, demonstration programs, and advocacy campaigns to help ensure that 
    low-income and other underserved communities benefit from the "digital 
    revolution." Over the past three years, the Children's Partnership has 
    focused on developing an agenda to further public policies that support community 
    technology and online content that fulfills the needs of low-income communities.</p>
  <p>As the community technology field continues to grow, the Children's Partnership 
    is working to spread the word about information, tools, and effective programs 
    that can benefit centers across the country.</p>
  <p>In this article, TCP describes research and strategies which have practical 
    applications for community technology providers, such as: (1) New state-by-state 
    fact sheets about youth and technology; (2) Lessons for using cable franchise 
    renegotiations to gain funding and resources for community technology efforts; 
    and (3) Tools for informing elected officials and policymakers about community 
    technology issues.</p>
  <span class="subhead">(1) 50 State Fact Sheets on Youth and Technology Readiness</span>
  <p>The Children's Partnership presents new <a
href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/youngamericans/statefacts.html" target="_blank">state-by-state 
    data</a> on how each of the 50 states is faring in addressing the technology 
    gap. These data help paint a picture of the benefits technology access offers 
    youth and low-income communities, as well as where gaps remain. Check out 
    statistics for your own state, such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Are your state's youth prepared for the digital economy? 
  </li>
  <li>Are your state's schools equipping today's youth?</li>
  <li>How does your state compare to other states in equipping 
      youth with technology skills?</li>
</ul>
  <p>Share this information with elected officials, civic leaders, the media, 
    and colleagues.</p>
  <span class="subhead">(2) Cable Franchise Renewals Offer Opportunities for Community Technology 
    Programs</span>
  <p>As community technology initiatives grapple with shrinking resources due 
    to the slowing economy, it is increasingly challenging to find funding. 
    However, even in these difficult times, a promising source of funding and 
    resources for community technology is city-level cable franchise renewals. 
    Seattle, Cleveland, Atlanta, and a handful of other cities have secured substantial 
    resources for community technology using this strategy. This approach 
    merits a close look because several hundred cities are slated to enter into 
    either a cable franchise renewal or transfer over the next couple of years.</p>
  <span class="subhead"><b>How It Works</b></span>
  <p>The cable franchise is the agreement that establishes the type, quality, 
    and level of service the cable company will provide in the city. In 
    exchange, the cable provider can use the public's right-of-way to lay cable. 
    The cable franchise is determined for a number of years, sometimes as many 
    as 15, and locks in those provisions for that length of time. When the 
    franchise nears expiration, the city and the cable operator enter into negotiations 
    to renew the franchise. Usually, the city conducts a needs assessment 
    and invites the community to comment on the types of services, both current 
    and future, that the community needs. Based upon the input from the 
    community, the city negotiates on behalf of the community with the cable operator 
    to arrive at an agreement. </p>
  <span class="subhead"><b>Suggested Policies</b></span>
  <p>Based on the early experiences of several cities, it is becoming clearer 
    what policies civic leaders and advocates can push for to promote community 
    technology through cable franchise agreements. Suggested policies include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A technology fund to support community technology programs 
      that provide public access to computers and the Internet, training in technology 
      skills for low-income communities, and production of multimedia content;
  </li>
  <li>Free, reduced, or volume-discounted rates for cable modems 
      and monthly Internet subscriptions; and
  </li>
  <li>City staff assigned to support community technology.
  </li>
</ul> 
  <span class="subhead"><b>Demonstrated Success</b></span>
  <p>The successes are mounting: Cleveland received $3 million for a technology 
    fund; free cable modem and Internet service for one computer center in each 
    of the 21 city council wards; and a volume discount for Internet service and 
    cable modems for all city facilities, public libraries, computer centers, 
    and primary and secondary schools. Seattle received similar services 
    as Cleveland, but also employs a staff person to assist, coordinate resources 
    for, and strengthen the services and educational quality of community technology 
    programs.</p>
  <span class="subhead"><b>Additional Resources to Gain </b></span>
  <p>In addition to these services, other services that could be requested to 
    support community technology initiatives include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Channel capacity reserved for community-oriented needs:</b> 
      In order to ensure that the community can send and receive data quickly, 
      a certain portion of channel capacity should be reserved specifically for 
      community-related needs. Communities can then take advantage of the 
      ever-more powerful communications delivery systems, i.e., cable companies 
      upgrade from coaxial to optical cable.
  </li>
  <li><b>Connection to Institutional Networks, or</b> I-Nets: 
      These high-speed networks allow schools, libraries, and governmental entities 
      to communicate and share information with one another and the public.
  </li>
  <li><b>Public access support and resources for community 
      technology programs that provide local programming capabilities:</b> These 
      supports allow local community residents to develop programs they know are 
      of interest to their neighborhood.
  </li>
</ul>
  <span class="subhead"><b>Community Media and Community Technology: New</b><b> </b><b>Partnerships</b></span>
  <p>As more community technology programs begin to offer residents the ability 
    to create multimedia content to share with the community, there is a natural 
    synergy with the work of those who provide public access programming. 
    These "community media" providers have years of experience developing 
    programming that is aired on public cable channels. Moreover, the offerings 
    of community media and community technology are beginning to overlap as, for 
    example, community media hosts computer labs, while community technology programs 
    produce videos. Since both communities have their own user base, combining 
    constituencies could provide added political clout. The larger customer base 
    could also provide cable companies an additional incentive to offer more services.</p>
  <p>As you consider these options, <a
href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/" target="_blank">more resources about the 
    cable franchise renewal</a> are available online.</p>
  <span class="subhead">(3) Tools for Reaching Out to Elected Officials and Policymakers</span>
  <p>Election cycles offer community technology practitioners an important opportunity 
    to reach out to candidates running for office and to the newly elected officials 
    and their staff. Over time, these outreach efforts can help build a cadre 
    of new leaders aware of the benefits of community technology programs and 
    committed to promoting a public policy agenda that supports technology resources 
    for youth and low-income communities.</p>
  <p>To help community technology groups get involved, the Children's Partnership 
    (TCP), along with the <a
href="http://www.cctpg.org/" target="_blank">California Community Technology Policy 
    Group</a> (CCTPG) and <a
href="http://www.policylink.org/" target="_blank">PolicyLink</a>, has launched 
    the <a
href="http://www.cctpg.org/other/elections/index.htm" target="_blank">Youth & 
    Technology Candidate Information Program</a>. The Youth & Technology 
    Candidate Information Program includes an information packet and outreach 
    plan designed to inform candidates and elected officials about community technology 
    issues and to encourage them to adopt an agenda that supports technology access 
    for youth and low-income communities. </p>
  <p>The Candidate Information Program includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Practical Information, including why this issue matters, 
      a summary of voters' views, a statistical picture of technology readiness 
      in California (as a model), policy ideas you can promote to demonstrate 
      leadership, and resources for further help.
  </li>
  <li>Candidate Briefings from local leaders and national experts 
      on this issue, which include standardized briefing materials available to 
      everyone.
  </li>
  <li>Suggestions about connecting elected officials with visits 
      to Local Community Technology Programs to see how technology access and 
      training work and also to learn about the benefits they offer young people.
  </li>
</ul>
  <p>These materials are designed to be used in any state and can also be adapted 
    for policymakers at the state, local and federal levels. They can be used 
    for outreach to candidates as they are running for office and as briefing 
    packets for elected officials, their staff and other stakeholders. These 
    materials were used for the 2002 election cycle in California, including the 
    <a
href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/interm.html" target="_blank">candidate survey</a> 
    on Youth and Technology issues. </p>
  <p>As another type of election activity, TCP coordinated an online voter registration 
    and education drive with several community technology programs throughout 
    California as a way to promote community technology and centers' capacity 
    to provide e-government services and engage citizens in the elections. 
    Resources to initiate this type of activity are available <a href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/e-lection.html" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>
