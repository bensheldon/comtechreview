  <p>Many rural and inner city communities face a situation in which reliance 
    on traditional methods of community planning and decision-making have resulted 
    in shrinking communities with a constant outflow of the young from the community--most 
    never return. Despite overwhelming evidence that traditional economic development 
    and educational methods are not working, these communities struggle mightily, 
    continuing to rely on strategies that were appropriate forty years ago but 
    no longer apply in a wired world and in an economy driven not by the geographic 
    solidity of manufacturing but by the permeability and boundarylessness of 
    information. </p>
  <p>If we must accept the notion that everything around us is changing, where 
    is the stability in our lives? What are the anchors in our lives? What is 
    the bedrock that we can cling to in this storm of change?</p>
  <p>In a world where change is a constant, the only things we can rely on are 
    our relationships with others&#151;our family, our friends, our neighbors, 
    and the larger community of people with whom we live and work. </p>
  <p>We dare not cede the future of our communities to the technologists&#151;those 
    who profit by selling technology. Technology has just one role that can be 
    stated plainly and simply: <i>Technology should and must support human 
    relationships.</i> </p>
  <p>If we are going to use technology, then technology must make it easier for 
    us to communicate with those with whom we have a relationship. This is the 
    proper role of technology, in the classroom, in the family, in the workplace, 
    and in the community.</p>
  <p>But what has changed? The concept of the Knowledge Democracy involves three 
    key points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, the acknowledgment that telecommunications and 
      the rise of the Internet have permanently altered the way people acquire 
      and use information. In the past, distribution of information about community 
      issues and affairs was expensive and tedious. Information was often passed 
      informally through the maintenance of human relationships in the community. 
      Today, information is widely available from many sources, and human relationships 
      are no longer needed to obtain information.</li>
  <li>Second, a civil society trying to make decisions will 
      be most effective when the process of finding the common good is regarded 
      as a mutually interdependent effort in which the goal is to help all parties 
      to the process succeed. This approach requires constant maintenance of relationships 
      through mutual respect of the opinions of others, gained by speaking, listening, 
      and understanding.</li>
  <li>Third, the American model of democracy works best when 
      approached as an ongoing set of conversations about issues, leading to a 
      consensus within the community about the best course of action. These conversations 
      are purposeful, parallel processes designed not just to talk about the issues 
      but also to reach consensus on how the community should proceed. These processes 
      are aimed at rebuilding trust by letting citizens participate fully in all 
      aspects of deciding what to do about a key issue.</li>
</ul>
 
  <p>A community operating on the principles of the Knowledge Democracy will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make equitable use of information technology to encourage 
      broad participation in conversations by as many individuals and organizations 
      as possible. Information technology will also be used to gather, interpret, 
      and disseminate widely all opinions and information about an issue, to those 
      interested individuals and organizations.</li>
  <li>Make a commitment to place the highest priority on human 
      relationships, which are the basis of a healthy community. Participants 
      in community discussions will agree to speak with care, to listen with respect, 
      and to make every effort to understand the needs and wants of others (even 
      if they disagree).</li>
  <li>Make a commitment to seek consensus on issues and to respect 
      the basic principles of representative democracy, rather than automatically 
      resorting to litigation when outcomes reflect a consensus for the common 
      good rather than self-serving wants.</li>
</ul>
  <p>There are numerous challenges that will affect communities over the next 
    twenty to forty years.</p>
  <h3><b>Ownership and distribution of information</b></h3>
  <p>Who owns information? Who can distribute it? Does the malleability of pure 
    data change ownership rights?</p>
  <p>If technology changes more quickly than the courts and lawmakers can reasonably 
    respond, who protects communities and consumers? Government regulation often 
    provokes unintended and costly consequences. One alternative is for individuals 
    and communities to intentionally develop and support open source software 
    and hardware that places no artificial limits on how information is used.</p>
  <h3><b>The right to communicate as a basic principle of democracy</b></h3>
  <p>Companies that provide network access are often contractually restricting 
    our rights to use the network to express ourselves.</p>
  <p>Suppose a community is served primarily by a single Internet Service Provider 
    (ISP) called BigNetworks, Inc. Using a community-sponsored online discussion 
    forum, citizens and local leaders begin discussing plans to introduce competition 
    in the community by encouraging a regional ISP to expand service into the 
    area. Today, BigNetworks, with a few lines of software, could cut off access 
    to that community online forum for all their customers in the community.</p>
  <h3><b>Privacy issues</b></h3>
  <p>The need for the privacy of personal information must be balanced against 
    the need of the community for open communication.</p>
  <p>A basic tenet of democracy is that we know the speaker. Before the rise of 
    the Internet, most discussions were held in a physical place (the town hall 
    meeting), where it was easy to recognize who was speaking. This recognition 
    process is a powerful social incentive to be civil. Online, those social incentives 
    are very weak, hence the common "flaming" where people write things 
    online that they would never say in a face-to-face conversation.</p>
  <h3><b>Ownership of telecommunications infrastructure</b></h3>
  <p>Communities can ensure a sustainable future only by prudent investment in 
    telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Often, a discussion about community-owned telecommunications tends to focus 
    on wired vs. wireless, or copper vs. fiber, or more generally, about technology 
    rather than service. Wired and wireless services already coexist seamlessly 
    in the telephone world, and will do so as well in the Internet world. Rapid 
    changes in technology mean that there is never a "right solution" 
    or a "permanent" technology choice. </p>
  <h3><b>Changing relationship between government and citizens</b></h3>
  <p>The network and its ability to distribute information quickly and inexpensively 
    creates a more equitable balance of power in the community.</p>
  <p>Time is a precious commodity today, and many community members find it difficult 
    to participate in community affairs simply because of the time involved. Internet 
    services--email, mailing lists, Web sites, and discussion forums--offer new 
    channels for distributing information and new ways of engaging people in the 
    life of the community. But human-led processes are needed to ensure that discussions 
    are fair and equitable, respectful of all, and to ensure that discussions 
    actually lead to outcomes supported by a consensus of participants.</p>
  <h3><b>Leadership crisis</b></h3>
  <p>Where will the leaders of future come from? How will they learn to lead with 
    respect and civility?</p>
  <p>Leaders must be developed locally, from within the community, using locally-managed 
    programs that provide appropriate opportunities for potential leaders to learn 
    how to become effective process leaders. Nonprofit organizations are providing 
    new sources of leaders to replace the now lost businesspeople. Youth programs 
    crafted intentionally to provide leadership opportunities and training help 
    ensure communities have a sustainable future.</p>
  <h3><b>Decision-making crisis</b></h3>
  <p>How communities make decisions affects not just the present but potentially 
    reaches far into the future.</p>
  <p>There are few issues in a community on which all will agree. In a civil society, 
    the next best choice is to seek consensus. Consensus is developed by an active 
    process of respectful speech, thoughtful listening, and a commitment to understanding 
    the point of view of others (note that understanding someone is different 
    from agreeing with them). Consensus is reached when all sides agree to respect 
    a decision and to move on. This is best done intentionally, with a well-defined 
    process, rather than leaving it to chance.</p>
  <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
  <p>As individuals and as members of organizations and communities, our wealth 
    and our abundance are rooted in our ability to tell our stories. Small business 
    entrepreneurs have a story to tell. Neighborhoods trying to regain a sense 
    of community have a story to tell. Senior citizens and second graders have 
    a story to tell. Local government has a story to tell. The vision of the Knowledge 
    Democracy should be to unleash the potential to have everyone in the community&#151;regardless 
    of who or what they are&#151;possess the skills to tell their story without 
    needing permission from someone else.</p>
