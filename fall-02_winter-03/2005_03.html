<h3 class="title">Editors' Introduction: Community Technology in a Post 9-11 World (Part II)</h3>

<TABLE align=right border=1 width="23%">
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD>
<H2><FONT size=-2><B><FONT size=-1>Submitting articles to the Review</FONT></B></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT size=-1>The editors welcome the submission of new material on an on-going basis and are committed to working with first-time authors as well as experienced writers to produce well-written pieces covering key developments and resources in the growing field of community media and technology. Projects written about should be well into the implementation stage as it is unusual for us to feature pieces about plans and future developments. Themes include a continued interest in community building and special programs and resources supported by AmeriCorps and the Corporation for National and Community Service. Authors should give consideration to photos and graphics as well as text.<a href="submit.php">Abstracts as well as more developed pieces are welcome.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The slowdown in the rapid expansion of community technology in light of the Dot Com bubble burst and the events and follow-up to September 11, 2001, was the subject of our last editorial introduction and still defines our present context. The major issue we continue to face is this: Will the consolidation that is taking place make the most of the community technology development boom, preserving and extending model programs and lessons, or will the winding down encapsulate all the minuses as well as pluses of the boom, only on a reduced scale?</P>
<P>The options are not mutually exclusive. We believe we've captured some of the major pluses here: promising updates from CTCNet and AFCN, model profiles of projects from around the country – and around the world, as the international community technology movement gathers momentum since <a href="article.php?article_id=144" target=_blank>its first global community networking congress in Barcelona</A> in December 2000. This past September, the <I>ComTechReview</I> co-sponsored a two week long international online orm on community technology called "<a href="http://www.civicnet02.net/story.shtml" target=_blank>CivicNet '02" Building Local Power With Community Networks</A>. From September 18 until October 2, over one hundred and fifty participants from over fifteen countries attended a series of virtual roundtables, open discussions, book reviews with authors, and special resource sessions. Discussions centered on the practice of facilitating and moderating online discussions, the increasingly globalized environment for community technology initiatives, and emerging tools and technologies that have the potential to empower local communities in the future. </P>
<P>This online forum was the third in a series of "Virtual CivicNets" that began in the late 1990s and are summarized at the beginning of our International section.</P>
<P>Will an online interactive forum like CivicNet become a "regular feature" for future issues and subscribers of the <I>Community Technology Review</I>? The editors were excited by the high quality of the discussions and the gold mine of reference material, much of which is included in our developing interactive "<a href="resources.php" target=_blank>Resource</A>" section below where <a href="resources.php" target=_blank>readers contribute to the ongoing compilation</A> of useful papers and reports, discussion lists and web sites, organizations and application service providers. Everyone who registered for CivicNet '02 will be receiving a copy of the current issue along with a special CD-ROM of the online forum proceedings.</P>
<P>As our web site is now receiving over 1,000 individual site visits per week, with each visit averaging over ten minutes in length, we're eager to explore new ways for the <I>Review</I> to become increasingly engaging and interactive with readers and subscribers. Thanks to the addition of CTC VISTA Melissa Daigle as Assistant Editor, our issues will be more frequent over the coming year, to provide us with more opportunities to publicize more good projects and resources.</P>
<P>We know there is growing interest in community technology and not many forums available for addressing its issues in an extended manner. We will be exploring ways in the year ahead to increase our visibility, expand this publication, and improve ways for people to engage in discussions about the issues and projects described. We welcome you as a contributor (see sidebar), and we welcome <a href="submit.php">your comments</A> on our views here and in the accompanying pieces, another of the <a href="#comments">interactive features</A> we began in the last issue and continue here. Let us know what you think.  – pm & rc</P>

<h3 class="title">From The Children's Partnership: Strategies and Resources for Community Technology Practitioners</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/" target="_blank">Children's 
    Partnership</a> (TCP) is a national child advocacy organization that undertakes 
    research, demonstration programs, and advocacy campaigns to help ensure that 
    low-income and other underserved communities benefit from the "digital 
    revolution." Over the past three years, the Children's Partnership has 
    focused on developing an agenda to further public policies that support community 
    technology and online content that fulfills the needs of low-income communities.</p>
  <p>As the community technology field continues to grow, the Children's Partnership 
    is working to spread the word about information, tools, and effective programs 
    that can benefit centers across the country.</p>
  <p>In this article, TCP describes research and strategies which have practical 
    applications for community technology providers, such as: (1) New state-by-state 
    fact sheets about youth and technology; (2) Lessons for using cable franchise 
    renegotiations to gain funding and resources for community technology efforts; 
    and (3) Tools for informing elected officials and policymakers about community 
    technology issues.</p>
  <h3>(1) 50 State Fact Sheets on Youth and Technology Readiness</h3>
  <p>The Children's Partnership presents new <a
href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/youngamericans/statefacts.html" target="_blank">state-by-state 
    data</a> on how each of the 50 states is faring in addressing the technology 
    gap. These data help paint a picture of the benefits technology access offers 
    youth and low-income communities, as well as where gaps remain. Check out 
    statistics for your own state, such as: </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>Are your state's youth prepared for the digital economy? 
    </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>Are your state's schools equipping today's youth? </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>How does your state compare to other states in equipping 
      youth with technology skills?</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p>Share this information with elected officials, civic leaders, the media, 
    and colleagues.</p>
  <h3>(2) Cable Franchise Renewals Offer Opportunities for Community Technology 
    Programs</h3>
  <p>As community technology initiatives grapple with shrinking resources due 
    to the slowing economy, it is increasingly challenging to find funding. 
    However, even in these difficult times, a promising source of funding and 
    resources for community technology is city-level cable franchise renewals. 
    Seattle, Cleveland, Atlanta, and a handful of other cities have secured substantial 
    resources for community technology using this strategy. This approach 
    merits a close look because several hundred cities are slated to enter into 
    either a cable franchise renewal or transfer over the next couple of years.</p>
  <h4><b>How It Works</b></h4>
  <p>The cable franchise is the agreement that establishes the type, quality, 
    and level of service the cable company will provide in the city. In 
    exchange, the cable provider can use the public's right-of-way to lay cable. 
    The cable franchise is determined for a number of years, sometimes as many 
    as 15, and locks in those provisions for that length of time. When the 
    franchise nears expiration, the city and the cable operator enter into negotiations 
    to renew the franchise. Usually, the city conducts a needs assessment 
    and invites the community to comment on the types of services, both current 
    and future, that the community needs. Based upon the input from the 
    community, the city negotiates on behalf of the community with the cable operator 
    to arrive at an agreement. </p>
  <h4><b>Suggested Policies</b></h4>
  <p>Based on the early experiences of several cities, it is becoming clearer 
    what policies civic leaders and advocates can push for to promote community 
    technology through cable franchise agreements. Suggested policies include:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> A technology fund to support community technology programs 
      that provide public access to computers and the Internet, training in technology 
      skills for low-income communities, and production of multimedia content;</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Free, reduced, or volume-discounted rates for cable modems 
      and monthly Internet subscriptions; and</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> City staff assigned to support community technology.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1> 
  <h4><b>Demonstrated Success</b></h4>
  <p>The successes are mounting: Cleveland received $3 million for a technology 
    fund; free cable modem and Internet service for one computer center in each 
    of the 21 city council wards; and a volume discount for Internet service and 
    cable modems for all city facilities, public libraries, computer centers, 
    and primary and secondary schools. Seattle received similar services 
    as Cleveland, but also employs a staff person to assist, coordinate resources 
    for, and strengthen the services and educational quality of community technology 
    programs.</p>
  <h4><b>Additional Resources to Gain </b></h4>
  <p>In addition to these services, other services that could be requested to 
    support community technology initiatives include: </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> <b>Channel capacity reserved for community-oriented needs:</b> 
      In order to ensure that the community can send and receive data quickly, 
      a certain portion of channel capacity should be reserved specifically for 
      community-related needs. Communities can then take advantage of the 
      ever-more powerful communications delivery systems, i.e., cable companies 
      upgrade from coaxial to optical cable.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> <b>Connection to Institutional Networks, or</b> I-Nets: 
      These high-speed networks allow schools, libraries, and governmental entities 
      to communicate and share information with one another and the public.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> <b>Public access support and resources for community 
      technology programs that provide local programming capabilities:</b> These 
      supports allow local community residents to develop programs they know are 
      of interest to their neighborhood.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1> 
  <h4><b>Community Media and Community Technology: New</b><b> </b><b>Partnerships</b></h4>
  <p>As more community technology programs begin to offer residents the ability 
    to create multimedia content to share with the community, there is a natural 
    synergy with the work of those who provide public access programming. 
    These "community media" providers have years of experience developing 
    programming that is aired on public cable channels. Moreover, the offerings 
    of community media and community technology are beginning to overlap as, for 
    example, community media hosts computer labs, while community technology programs 
    produce videos. Since both communities have their own user base, combining 
    constituencies could provide added political clout. The larger customer base 
    could also provide cable companies an additional incentive to offer more services.</p>
  <p>As you consider these options, <a
href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/" target="_blank">more resources about the 
    cable franchise renewal</a> are available online.</p>
  <h3>(3) Tools for Reaching Out to Elected Officials and Policymakers</h3>
  <p>Election cycles offer community technology practitioners an important opportunity 
    to reach out to candidates running for office and to the newly elected officials 
    and their staff. Over time, these outreach efforts can help build a cadre 
    of new leaders aware of the benefits of community technology programs and 
    committed to promoting a public policy agenda that supports technology resources 
    for youth and low-income communities.</p>
  <p>To help community technology groups get involved, the Children's Partnership 
    (TCP), along with the <a
href="http://www.cctpg.org/" target="_blank">California Community Technology Policy 
    Group</a> (CCTPG) and <a
href="http://www.policylink.org/" target="_blank">PolicyLink</a>, has launched 
    the <a
href="http://www.cctpg.org/other/elections/index.htm" target="_blank">Youth & 
    Technology Candidate Information Program</a>. The Youth & Technology 
    Candidate Information Program includes an information packet and outreach 
    plan designed to inform candidates and elected officials about community technology 
    issues and to encourage them to adopt an agenda that supports technology access 
    for youth and low-income communities. </p>
  <p>The Candidate Information Program includes:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Practical Information, including why this issue matters, 
      a summary of voters' views, a statistical picture of technology readiness 
      in California (as a model), policy ideas you can promote to demonstrate 
      leadership, and resources for further help.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Candidate Briefings from local leaders and national experts 
      on this issue, which include standardized briefing materials available to 
      everyone.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class=Section1> Suggestions about connecting elected officials with visits 
      to Local Community Technology Programs to see how technology access and 
      training work and also to learn about the benefits they offer young people.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>These materials are designed to be used in any state and can also be adapted 
    for policymakers at the state, local and federal levels. They can be used 
    for outreach to candidates as they are running for office and as briefing 
    packets for elected officials, their staff and other stakeholders. These 
    materials were used for the 2002 election cycle in California, including the 
    <a
href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/interm.html" target="_blank">candidate survey</a> 
    on Youth and Technology issues. </p>
  <p>As another type of election activity, TCP coordinated an online voter registration 
    and education drive with several community technology programs throughout 
    California as a way to promote community technology and centers' capacity 
    to provide e-government services and engage citizens in the elections. 
    Resources to initiate this type of activity are available <a href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/e-lection.html" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title">CTCs for Positive Youth Development: Findings from PowerUP's First Phase Evaluation</h3>

<table width="37%" border="1" align="right">
    <tr> 
      <td><font size="-1">Ed. Note: The following article was written before the 
        announcement to PowerUP members in early October that the national office 
        would be closing and the more public announcement, led by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/technology/30POWE.html?tntemail">John 
        Schwartz's New York Times story on October 30</a>. It reviews some of 
        the key contributions of PowerUP centers that can continue to influence

  <h3>Community Technology and Positive Youth Development</h3>
  <p><a href="http://www.powerup.org/" target="_blank">PowerUP</a> is a national 
    digital divide initiative whose mission is to ensure that America's underserved 
    youth acquire the skills, experiences and resources they need to succeed in 
    the digital age.&nbsp; Since the organization was launched in November of 
    1999, PowerUP has supported hundreds of local community technology centers 
    by providing technology resources and youth development programming in communities 
    across the United States and Puerto Rico.&nbsp; PowerUP creates and supports 
    local centers by donating computer hardware and software, Internet connectivity, 
    technical assistance, and staff training and support. In addition, it has 
    created and disseminated an online youth development curriculum for use by 
    local centers. This curriculum is organized around the Five Promises of <a href="http://www.americaspromise.org/" target="_blank">America's 
    Promise</a>: </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Ongoing relationships with caring adults,</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Safe places with structured activities during non-school 
      hours,</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> A healthy start,</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Marketable skills through effective education, and</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>Opportunities to give back through community service.
      <div class=Section1></div>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1>An evaluation of the PowerUP program documents the ways in 
  which the resources provided are used and valued by local centers.&nbsp; Our 
  evaluation report also provides a profile of the young people who are utilizing 
  the PowerUP centers and, most importantly, presents an exploratory assessment 
  of how the program is improving the lives of those attending the centers.&nbsp; 
  The evaluation was performed by <a href="http://www.evaluategroup.org/" target="_blank">E-Valuate</a> 
  and completed in January 2002, focusing on the 326 centers established during 
  PowerUP's first phase of operation.&nbsp; Methods include program director surveys 
  and interviews, guided observation of local center activities, and interviews 
  with more than 100 youth participants from around the country.</div>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>Here we present findings relevant to the structure, programming, and goals 
    of local PowerUP centers.&nbsp; We also report on some of the most poignant 
    findings&#151;those concerning participants' experiences in the centers.&nbsp; 
    Please access the <a
href="http://www.evaluategroup.org/Tools_and_Reports/index.htm" target="_blank">full 
    evaluation report</a> for more information on background and methods, and 
    for elaboration of these and other findings.</p>
</div>
<div class=Section1>
  <h3>Local Programming and Goals</h3>
</div>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>Evaluation findings illustrate the incredible organizational, cultural and 
    physical diversity of program settings within the national PowerUP network.&nbsp; 
    For example, centers are housed in Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, schools, independent 
    nonprofit community centers, and business development agencies.&nbsp; These 
    centers use non-uniform curricula to serve youth who vary tremendously by 
    age, ability, and need, and they operate within a multitude of programming 
    structures with varied capabilities.&nbsp; </p>
</div>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>Despite these significant differences, the evaluation data point to clear 
    trends in program structure and implementation.&nbsp; Specifically, centers 
    are generally open during after-school hours, on weekday afternoons and evenings, 
    and attended by an average of 195 youth per week.&nbsp; While PowerUP's target 
    age range is 5-18 years, youth of late-elementary and middle school ages are 
    the most prevalent, as over 60% of program participants are between the ages 
    of 8 and 13.&nbsp; Although centers report staffing to be a significant challenge, 
    they maintain an admirable 1 to 13 staff to youth ratio. Most importantly, 
    our findings make it clear that center staff are remarkably dynamic, committed, 
    and effective.</p>
</div>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>Despite significant diversity in local priorities and curricula, consistency 
    in central program goals and focus is evident.&nbsp; In general, PowerUP centers 
    share the common youth outcome goals of computer literacy and educational 
    achievement.&nbsp; Centers also tend to structure their programming around 
    the following top five activities: 1) Internet access and web surfing; 2) 
    creative activities such as digital imaging and multimedia projects; 3) educational 
    activities including homework and schoolwork presentations; 4) basic computer 
    training; and 5) word processing.&nbsp; The use of desktop applications is 
    common in the centers, with MS Word, Publisher, PowerPoint, and Mavis Beacon 
    Typing software ranking as the most valued and most often utilized applications.&nbsp; 
    Although structured, staff-guided activities are the norm, the vast majority 
    of programs also devote an average of eight hours per week to &quot;open lab,&quot; 
    when youth can engage in supervised, but unstructured, use of the computers 
    and the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class=Section1>
  <h3>Caring Adults in the Centers</h3>
</div>
<div class=Section1>When youth were asked, in interviews and surveys, what they 
  liked the most about the center, they overwhelmingly indicated that PowerUP 
  was a safe place where they had opportunities to forge meaningful connections 
  with caring adults.&nbsp; A full one hundred percent of youth interviewed reported 
  positive, warm relationships with adults in the PowerUP lab.&nbsp; Illustrating 
  this finding are the following typical comments made by youth:</div>
<div class=Section1><i>[The staff are] very respectful. [They] help you with questions 
  you don't know. [They] show you a nice smile.</i></div>
<div class=Section1><i>Nice. Help you. They're generous. They want you to feel 
  welcome. Even if I don't know them they are still really nice to me.</i></div>
<div class=Section1><i>Feel safe, like parents. I've known them more than 2 years.</i></div>
<div class=Section1>Local staff are also sensitive to their importance in the 
  lives of the young people they work with. During the evaluation team's visits 
  to local sites, staff described the trusting relationships they develop with 
  youth and they provided examples of the ways in which their centers place children 
  at the forefront of operations.&nbsp; The following quotes from center staff 
  capture the positive nature of their relationships with youth participants:</div>
<div class=Section1><i>Young people are made to feel that there is always someone 
  that they can turn to when there is a need for help.</i></div>
<div class=Section1><i>Trusting, positive [relationships], and the kids are given 
  the sense of competence, usefulness, belonging, and influence.</i></div>
<div class=Section1><i>Sometimes teens just need to talk. They'll tell me what 
  they've been doing. And I'm like: 'You're doing that?! Do your parents know?' 
  They talk about things they won't talk to their parents about, and you gradually 
  build up that kind of rapport.</i></div>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>These findings underscore the high caliber and caring approach of PowerUP 
    center staff.&nbsp; Staff members exhibit the type of passionate dedication 
    to youth that has been found to be the most essential element for the success 
    of youth-serving programs.</p>
</div>
<div class=Section1>
  <h3>Safe Places with Structured Activities</h3>
</div>
<div class=Section1>Similarly, the evaluation data strongly support a characterization 
  of PowerUP centers as physically and emotionally safe environments offering 
  constructive activities.&nbsp; When local staff were asked what they believed 
  was the most valuable thing their center does for youth, one of the most common 
  responses was &quot;providing a safe and positive place to be.&quot;&nbsp; Staff 
  indicate that they create a physically safe and nurturing environment by:&nbsp; 
  1) offering skilled and caring supervision; 2) maintaining a clean, orderly, 
  and inviting center;&nbsp; 3) setting clear and firm expectations for center 
  behavior;&nbsp; and 4) controlling access to children by way of locks, sign-in 
  sheets, and receptionists.</div>
<div class=Section1>Youth concur with staff perceptions of safety, as more than 
  96% of participants reported feeling safe in the computer center.&nbsp; Youth 
  comments indicate that centers provide not only a physically safe space, but 
  also an emotional refuge.&nbsp; The following youth statements illustrate this 
  finding:</div>
<div class=Section1><i>The adults make it feel pretty safe. Nothing could harm 
  you here.</i></div>
<div class=Section1><i>I feel safe because [the center] has people that would 
  risk their lives for us ...</i></div>
<div class=Section1>
  <p><i>No one picks on you.&nbsp; It's fair, you get a turn.&nbsp; There's no

<div class=Section1>The full evaluation report provides extensive elaboration

  one of the most compelling, overarching messages which emerged from the evaluation 
  study:&nbsp; It is the people, the staff, in these centers that make these programs 
  what they are.&nbsp; In these centers youth are surrounded by adults whom they 
  trust, confide in, and look to for mentorship and coaching. For their part, 
  the adults know how important they are to the young people. One Americorps/VISTA 
  member who directs a PowerUP program in rural Kentucky summed up her role and 
  the promise of her program in this way: &nbsp;</div>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p>I am so pleased to be a part of helping bring this opportunity to the children 
    I live near and love.&nbsp; I work as an Americorps VISTA in my home community 
    and I feel this has been the best year of my life. I grew up with people here 
    who, like my own husband, are finally seeing that computer skills are the 
    way out of the coal mines&#151;the low paying dirt jobs which were the stark 
    realities faced by our youth...they are being erased for our children by people 
    and organizations like PowerUP.<br>

<h3 class="title">Fred Johnson Comes to UMass/Boston</h3>

<P>Despite the entanglements that accompany a move to a new area and a new job (in this case, finding housing and wading through the university's red tape), Fred Johnson is quickly finding his niche in the Boston area and on the campus of the University of Massachusetts/Boston. This fall, the College of Public and Community Service (CPCS) at UMB welcomed Johnson as the new&#151;and first&#151;professor of <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/" target=_blank>Community Media and Technology</A>.</P>
<P><IMG align=left height=158 src="fall-02_winter-03/daigle8.JPG" width=287>Since the beginning of his career, Fred Johnson (pictured here, far right, with CTC VISTAs James Fishwick and Melissa Daigle) has focused on the importance of using advanced technology for local democracy. He earned his Masters in Communication in the 1970s and has since worked as a telecommunications policy analyst, a cable access center director, and a teacher of community media topics at universities including Antioch College and Portland State University. Johnson has produced a number of documentaries independently, for PBS, and for the BBC. In 1987, Johnson founded the <A href="http://www.mwg.org/" target=_blank>Media Working Group</A>, an organization created to encourage critical thinking about the impact of electronic media on art, society, and culture, and in 2000, he was Planning Project Director for the Ford Foundation's "<A href="http://www.namac.org/Directions/" target=_blank>Digital Directions</A>," a study on the effect of digital conversion on media arts.</P>
<P>In each role, Johnson has gained the praises of community media movers-and-shakers and has found a place among their ranks. When asked which role he enjoyed most, Johnson replied in his light Appalachian drawl, "I like it all...The exception, most probably, is making documentaries about social issues and doing it with groups or organizations in such a way that expresses things from their point-of-view&#151;arts, social issues&#151;<I>with</I> people rather than about people. I love the process of making documentaries for TV, the web, etc... But jumping to other jobs is not hard to understand: it's all quite interrelated actually."</P>
<P>When he first heard about the UMB's Community Media and Technology program, Johnson was interested, but didn't immediately see his role in it. "Later, I saw the job listing on a listserv, but I was in Ireland [filming a documentary]. When I got back in the country that spring, I thought that I might enjoy teaching full-time, so I got in touch with Peter Miller and Reebee Garafalo at UMB."</P>
<P>"To me Fred embodies the ideal of a CPCS faculty member," says Reebee Garofalo, the coordinator of the CMT Program at UMB. "[He's] someone who combines practical skills&#151;in this case, documentary film-making, video production, and digital editing&#151;with the theory and analysis that encourages critical reflection on how such skills are used. He is a true scholar/activist, with a commitment to giving voice to unheard populations, and as such he represents an excellent fit with the mission of the College."</P>
<P>Community Media and Technology is already a <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/concentration.html" target=_blank>certificate option</A> for students at UMB&#151;and elsewhere, anywhere, since it's offered online as well as on campus&#151;and a groundbreaking <A href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/proposal.html" target=_blank>major</A> is being developed. This degree program will train current and future community leaders in the significance and application of technology and media in nonprofit and community building. Johnson sees the degree having an impact in two major ways. "First, the program will help define the community technology movement by training people as technologists and media builders and by setting standards to create a culture around these movements. They'll be trained professionals in that area, accredited, with a demonstrated background set in a program specifically designed to meet community technology needs."</P>
<P>The second, more immediate impact involves the program's Boston location. "There's a critical mass here, a highly developed group of community media and technology practitioners... We hope to engage [these groups] in a critical dialogue about the future of the CMT program, such as what kinds of development changes should be undertaken."</P>
<P>"Media and technology are the way that the status quo is maintained. They'll be tools for the powerful until we change that," says Johnson. "I feel a responsibility; I feel a desire and a delight in being involved in the policy and democracy of media. Media must be inclusive of populations and ideas, and the policies must reflect the diversity and social makeup of our society."</P>
<P>Fred Johnson has indeed followed his desire and his sense of responsibility throughout the years. Those of us at UMB and in the Boston area are glad that the path has led him here, and we are eager to tap into his talents and passion in the community media and technology field. </P>

        <H4><font size="-1">CTC Support Project Places Technical Volunteers for MIT CityDays</font></H4>
        <H3><font size="-1"><I>Marissa Martin</I></font></H3>
        <P><font size="-1">Forty-five MIT students volunteered at Boston-area 
          CTCs on August 30, 2002, as part of a joint CTCNet Service Learning 
          and <A href="http://web.mit.edu/mitpsc/programs/citydays ">MIT CityDays</A> 
          event. (MIT CityDays is a project of the <A href="http://web.mit.edu/mitpsc">MIT 
          Public Service Center</A>.) Participating CTCs included the Urban League 
          of Eastern Massachusetts, El Batey Technology Center, and the McNamara 
          House.  </font></P>
        <P><font size="-1">The three groups of MIT student volunteers relocated 
          computer and other equipment, set up a community cookout for immigrant 
          and special needs residents, and set up take-home computers in peoples' 
          homes. "It was an excellent event and a great opportunity,"said Khalid 
          Mustafa, a program director at the <A href="http://www.ulem.org/">Urban 
          League of Eastern Massachusetts</A>. "[This] opens up lines of communication 
          with the students and offers them exposure to the community." About 
          twenty energetic and enthusiastic student volunteers pitched in to move 
          computers and other equipment at the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts 
          CTC.  Afterwards, Mustafa gave them program brochures and business 
          cards.  "A couple of them seemed really interested in coming back."</font></P>
        <P><font size="-1">Angel Peralta, General Manager of <A href="http://www.villatechonline.org/">El 
          Batey</A>, a CTC that serves the predominately Latino community Inquilinos 
          Boricuas en Accion, was also grateful for the volunteers' assistance. "They 
          did a great job.  I was amazed how organized they were." At El 
          Batey, the MIT students gave the computer lab a makeover, including 
          rewiring for the new set-up.  Several volunteers then brought the 
          take-home recycled computers to life in residents' homes</font></P>
        <P><font size="-1">The CTC Support Project arranged for the collaboration 
          with MIT for the event.  One major goal of the CTC Support Project 
          is to bring together universities and CTCs for mutual learning and benefit.</font></P>

  <P>When <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org" target=_blank>CTCNet</A> was awarded 
    a grant from State Street's Global Philanthropy Program in July of 2000, we 
    intended to pilot a Floating Help Desk that would involve roughly 14 CTCNet 
    affiliates in the Boston Metropolitan area.</P>

  <P>During the project planning process, we realized that to create a replicable 
    support model that would consistently address the volunteer and operational 
    needs of CTCs, we would need to include services that reached far beyond the 
    level of support offered by a simple help desk. The Technical 
    Volunteer Matching Program was the first component of the project to be 
    implemented in the summer of 2001, established for recruiting local, skilled 
    technical volunteers to provide participating CTCs with direct and onsite 
    technical support in response to a CTC's specific requests for service. Since 
    then, the CTC Support Project has developed in size, capacity, and scope appropriately 
    reflecting the technical needs identified by CTCs and currently also includes:</P>

<UL>
  <LI> 
    <DIV class=Section1>Quarterly 
      Workshop Series—Intended to help the staff and directors of our 
      participating centers deepen their knowledge in various areas that cannot 
      be addressed through the use of volunteers.  The topics of each workshop/training 
      are specific issues that the CTCs themselves have identified and are struggling 
      to resolve.</DIV>
  <LI> 
    <DIV class=Section1>Technical 
      Help Desk—Addresses short-term and specific technical needs without 
      the presence of an onsite volunteer.  A local phone number and email

<DIV align=center><FONT size=-1><B>Remembering CTCNet Founder Toni Stone </B></FONT></DIV>
<P><FONT size=-1>On Thursday, November 21, CTCNet founder Toni Stone died. The notice posted on the CTCNet members list the next day and elsewhere has been followed up by scores of testimonials, including a remembrance on the <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/tonistone/" target=_blank>CTCNet site</A>. A more complete tribute will be published in the next issue of the <EM>Review</EM>.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<DIV class=Section1>
<P><IMG align=left height=223 src="fall-02_winter-03/schackman_karen2.jpg" width=173>In September, CTCNet Executive Director Karen Chandler announced that she is leaving CTCNet in 2003. Said Chandler, "It is with very mixed feelings that after nearly four years of service to CTCNet members, I have decided to move on. My primary reason for leaving CTCNet is so that I may move back to California to be closer to loved ones." </P>
<P>Chandler joined CTCNet as a Project Coordinator in 1999 when she designed and coordinated the Leadership Development Institute, the CTCNet intensive training program for center directors, orchestrated two CTCNet National Conferences, assisted in developing partnerships, and provided general support services to member centers. She served as the Acting Executive Director from June 2000 until June 2001, when the Board of Directors voted to name her the Executive Director, sharing the leadership role in the organization with Stephen Ronan, Managing Director. </P>
<P><IMG align=right height=152 src="fall-02_winter-03/KC.Collette.KZ.Marg.jpg" width=289>Chandler would like to return to international development work which she developed a passion for while working in the community building field for two years in Cape Town, South Africa. Responding to the news, Erroll Reese, President of the CTCNet Board of Directors said, "As Board President, I would like to thank Karen for her role in the success of CTCNet over the past four years and wish much success to her in future endeavors."</P>
<P><IMG align=right height=126 src="fall-02_winter-03/KC_and_JP.jpg" width=131>As we go to press, the search for a new Executive Director is still underway. Interested candidates should submit a letter and resume to edsearch@ctcnet.org.</P>
<H3>CTCNet Opens Washington, DC Office</H3>
<P>This fall CTCNet expands its reach to the heart of national policy and foundation activity with the opening of a Washington, DC office. The October 1, 2002 opening marks the culmination of one of CTCNet's strategic goals set last fall in response to affiliate feedback which called for CTCNet to take a leading role in shaping digital divide policy in our nation's capital. </P>
<P><IMG align=left height=98 src="fall-02_winter-03/schackman_john.jpg" width=135><A href="mailto:jzoltner@ctcnet.org">John Zoltner</A>, the newly hired Director of Policy and Programs, has an extensive background in community technology at the grassroots and national levels. Most recently, he has worked for Gateway at Edgewood Terrace and Technology Works for Good, which provides technology resources to DC area nonprofits. </P>
<P>"John's initial focus will be on establishing a CTCNet location in DC and on building cross-sector partnerships on behalf of CTCNet affiliates," said CTCNet Executive Director Karen Chandler. "We are extremely pleased that John will join CTCNet and we look forward to seeing our DC presence grow."</P>
<H3>CTCNet Receives HHS—Compassion Capital Fund Grant</H3>
<P>On October 3, 2002, when U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson announced the recipients of a $30 million <A href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2002pres/20021003a.html" target=_blank>Compassion Capital Fund</A>, CTCNet was listed as the recipient of one of its major demonstration project grants.</P>
<P>"Connections for Tomorrow," a project of CTCNet and three partners—the Association of Christian Community Computer Centers (<A href="http://www.ac4.org/" target=_blank>AC4</A>), the Alliance for Technology Access (<A href="http://www.ataccess.org/" target=_blank>ATA</A>), and the Illinois Community Technology Consortium (<A href="http://www.mtag.org/" target=_blank>ILCTC</A>)—will be funded at approximately $2.25 million for Year One of the three-year project, with two-thirds of the budget ($1,499,770) federally funded. One-third of the project's budget ($750,000) will be made up of matching funds from non-governmental sources. Connections for Tomorrow will provide technical and operational training and support to faith- and community-based nonprofits in Massachusetts, Illinois, and California. Half of the federal funds ($750,000) will be awarded in the first year to Illinois-based organizations, with grants in years two and three to California and Massachusetts. </P>
<P>The Connections for Tomorrow project will start up, expand, and improve programs that incorporate technology into social services—everything from organizational management and capacity building to learning programs. The first year of the grant will be dedicated to programs for at-risk youth and to homeless individuals, including those with disabilities.</P>
<H3>CTC Success Stories Winners</H3>
<P>CTCNet has just announced the winners of the third round of <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/stories/v3/index.htm" target=_blank>the CTC Success Stories contest</A>. The contest was organized to highlight the work being done at affiliate centers.

<H3>New Round of Leadership Development Institutes (LDIs) </H3>
<P>With renewed support from the AT&T Foundation, CTCNet will conduct four Leadership Development Institutes (LDIs) in the upcoming year, beginning in November in Miami, FL.</P>
<P>Since March 1999, CTCNet has held twelve Institutes around the country. LDIs have become one of the key venues for training CTC leaders in center start-up and capacity building. Since 1999, approximately 230 participants representing 180 organizations and 31 states have attended. The <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/ldi/leadinst.htm">CTCNet LDI web site</A> provides updated information about the Institutes.<BR><BR></P>
<H3>Save the Date! CTCNet Conference 2003 set for June 26-29 in D.C.</H3>
<P>The twelfth annual CTCNet conference will take place at the Grand Hyatt Washington. This next conference will provide a special opportunity to showcase to the capital's policymakers the outstanding work that CTCs are doing around the country.</P>

<H3>CTCs as Technology Assistance Providers</H3>
<P>As a network of 700 community technology centers, sharing good ideas and wisdom from the field with the field goes to the heart of CTCNet's work. In 2002, with funding from the Surdna Foundation, CTCNet set out to explore the state of the community technology center field in the quest to deliver <STRONG>technology assistance that supports nonprofit organizations in their communities. CTCNet contracted with Summit Collaborative to interview community technology practitioners doing this work to get a snapshot of the field.</STRONG></P>
<P>CTCNet set out to gather information to answer the following questions:</P></DIV>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>What are the different ways that CTCs are delivering nonprofit technology assistance to community-based nonprofit organizations? </DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>How is nonprofit technology assistance linked to other CTC programs such as access, job training, computer training, youth programs, and others? </DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>What are the evolving practices, opportunities, and challenges in delivering technology assistance to nonprofit organizations?</DIV></LI></UL>
<DIV class=Section1>
<P>As the interviews progressed, several themes clearly emerged. Through collaborations or informally, community technology centers are putting their technology experience to work to deliver technical assistance and training to nonprofit organizations. Some CTCs are revising basic computer skills curriculum to fit the needs of nonprofit staff members. The expertise CTCs gain in helping to establish and support other community technology centers is in some cases helping them to advise nonprofit organizations to address "back-office" issues (technology for organizational use such as fundraising, planning, or financial management versus computer labs for programmatic or service delivery). Some CTCs are addressing the critical issue of sustainability by providing such services as community help desks that offer just-in-time technical support. Other CTCs are taking an entrepreneurial approach, doing market analysis and business planning leading to the launch of technology assistance programs. </P>
<P>A lot of this work is in the early stages of development and is still evolving. However it demonstrates that community technology centers have the potential to play a substantive role to help strengthen existing community infrastructure by providing technology assistance to community-based organizations.</P>
<P>—Excerpted from the Executive Summary of "<A href="http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/reports/ctctechprovreport.htm" target=_blank>Community Technology Centers as Technology Assistance Providers to Nonprofit & Community Based Organizations</A>," a report prepared for CTCNet by Beth Kanter, of Summit Collaborative, available in Word and PDF format. The full report includes an assessment of the challenges and opportunities that technology assistance to nonprofits provide and seven case studies/profiles of CTCs that are doing this.</P>

<h3 class="title">The Rise of the Knowledge Democracy</h3>

          human relationships.</font></i> </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Many rural and inner city communities face a situation in which reliance 
    on traditional methods of community planning and decision-making have resulted 
    in shrinking communities with a constant outflow of the young from the community--most 
    never return. Despite overwhelming evidence that traditional economic development 
    and educational methods are not working, these communities struggle mightily, 
    continuing to rely on strategies that were appropriate forty years ago but 
    no longer apply in a wired world and in an economy driven not by the geographic 
    solidity of manufacturing but by the permeability and boundarylessness of 
    information. </p>
  <p>If we must accept the notion that everything around us is changing, where 
    is the stability in our lives? What are the anchors in our lives? What is 
    the bedrock that we can cling to in this storm of change?</p>
  <p>In a world where change is a constant, the only things we can rely on are 
    our relationships with others&#151;our family, our friends, our neighbors, 
    and the larger community of people with whom we live and work. </p>
  <p>We dare not cede the future of our communities to the technologists&#151;those 
    who profit by selling technology. Technology has just one role that can be 
    stated plainly and simply: <i>Technology should and must support human 
    relationships.</i> </p>
  <p>If we are going to use technology, then technology must make it easier for 
    us to communicate with those with whom we have a relationship. This is the 
    proper role of technology, in the classroom, in the family, in the workplace, 
    and in the community.</p>
  <p>But what has changed? The concept of the Knowledge Democracy involves three 
    key points:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>First, the acknowledgment that telecommunications and 
      the rise of the Internet have permanently altered the way people acquire 
      and use information. In the past, distribution of information about community 
      issues and affairs was expensive and tedious. Information was often passed 
      informally through the maintenance of human relationships in the community. 
      Today, information is widely available from many sources, and human relationships 
      are no longer needed to obtain information.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>Second, a civil society trying to make decisions will 
      be most effective when the process of finding the common good is regarded 
      as a mutually interdependent effort in which the goal is to help all parties 
      to the process succeed. This approach requires constant maintenance of relationships 
      through mutual respect of the opinions of others, gained by speaking, listening, 
      and understanding.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>Third, the American model of democracy works best when 
      approached as an ongoing set of conversations about issues, leading to a 
      consensus within the community about the best course of action. These conversations 
      are purposeful, parallel processes designed not just to talk about the issues 
      but also to reach consensus on how the community should proceed. These processes 
      are aimed at rebuilding trust by letting citizens participate fully in all 
      aspects of deciding what to do about a key issue.</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p>A community operating on the principles of the Knowledge Democracy will:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>Make equitable use of information technology to encourage 
      broad participation in conversations by as many individuals and organizations 
      as possible. Information technology will also be used to gather, interpret, 
      and disseminate widely all opinions and information about an issue, to those 
      interested individuals and organizations.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>Make a commitment to place the highest priority on human 
      relationships, which are the basis of a healthy community. Participants 
      in community discussions will agree to speak with care, to listen with respect, 
      and to make every effort to understand the needs and wants of others (even 
      if they disagree). </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class=Section1>Make a commitment to seek consensus on issues and to respect 
      the basic principles of representative democracy, rather than automatically 
      resorting to litigation when outcomes reflect a consensus for the common 
      good rather than self-serving wants. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>There are numerous challenges that will affect communities over the next 
    twenty to forty years.</p>
  <h3><b>Ownership and distribution of information</b></h3>
  <p>Who owns information? Who can distribute it? Does the malleability of pure 
    data change ownership rights?</p>
  <p>If technology changes more quickly than the courts and lawmakers can reasonably 
    respond, who protects communities and consumers? Government regulation often 
    provokes unintended and costly consequences. One alternative is for individuals 
    and communities to intentionally develop and support open source software 
    and hardware that places no artificial limits on how information is used.</p>
  <h3><b>The right to communicate as a basic principle of democracy</b></h3>
  <p>Companies that provide network access are often contractually restricting 
    our rights to use the network to express ourselves.</p>
  <p>Suppose a community is served primarily by a single Internet Service Provider 
    (ISP) called BigNetworks, Inc. Using a community-sponsored online discussion 
    forum, citizens and local leaders begin discussing plans to introduce competition 
    in the community by encouraging a regional ISP to expand service into the 
    area. Today, BigNetworks, with a few lines of software, could cut off access 
    to that community online forum for all their customers in the community.</p>
  <h3><b>Privacy issues</b></h3>
  <p>The need for the privacy of personal information must be balanced against 
    the need of the community for open communication.</p>
  <p>A basic tenet of democracy is that we know the speaker. Before the rise of 
    the Internet, most discussions were held in a physical place (the town hall 
    meeting), where it was easy to recognize who was speaking. This recognition 
    process is a powerful social incentive to be civil. Online, those social incentives 
    are very weak, hence the common "flaming" where people write things 
    online that they would never say in a face-to-face conversation.</p>
  <h3><b>Ownership of telecommunications infrastructure</b></h3>
  <p>Communities can ensure a sustainable future only by prudent investment in 
    telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Often, a discussion about community-owned telecommunications tends to focus 
    on wired vs. wireless, or copper vs. fiber, or more generally, about technology 
    rather than service. Wired and wireless services already coexist seamlessly 
    in the telephone world, and will do so as well in the Internet world. Rapid 
    changes in technology mean that there is never a "right solution" 
    or a "permanent" technology choice. </p>
  <h3><b>Changing relationship between government and citizens</b></h3>
  <p>The network and its ability to distribute information quickly and inexpensively 
    creates a more equitable balance of power in the community.</p>
  <p>Time is a precious commodity today, and many community members find it difficult 
    to participate in community affairs simply because of the time involved. Internet 
    services--email, mailing lists, Web sites, and discussion forums--offer new 
    channels for distributing information and new ways of engaging people in the 
    life of the community. But human-led processes are needed to ensure that discussions 
    are fair and equitable, respectful of all, and to ensure that discussions 
    actually lead to outcomes supported by a consensus of participants.</p>
  <h3><b>Leadership crisis</b></h3>
  <p>Where will the leaders of future come from? How will they learn to lead with 
    respect and civility?</p>
  <p>Leaders must be developed locally, from within the community, using locally-managed 
    programs that provide appropriate opportunities for potential leaders to learn 
    how to become effective process leaders. Nonprofit organizations are providing 
    new sources of leaders to replace the now lost businesspeople. Youth programs 
    crafted intentionally to provide leadership opportunities and training help 
    ensure communities have a sustainable future.</p>
  <h3><b>Decision-making crisis</b></h3>
  <p>How communities make decisions affects not just the present but potentially 
    reaches far into the future.</p>
  <p>There are few issues in a community on which all will agree. In a civil society, 
    the next best choice is to seek consensus. Consensus is developed by an active 
    process of respectful speech, thoughtful listening, and a commitment to understanding 
    the point of view of others (note that understanding someone is different 
    from agreeing with them). Consensus is reached when all sides agree to respect 
    a decision and to move on. This is best done intentionally, with a well-defined 
    process, rather than leaving it to chance.</p>
  <h3><b>Summary</b></h3>
  <p>As individuals and as members of organizations and communities, our wealth 
    and our abundance are rooted in our ability to tell our stories. Small business 
    entrepreneurs have a story to tell. Neighborhoods trying to regain a sense 
    of community have a story to tell. Senior citizens and second graders have 
    a story to tell. Local government has a story to tell. The vision of the Knowledge 
    Democracy should be to unleash the potential to have everyone in the community&#151;regardless 
    of who or what they are&#151;possess the skills to tell their story without 
    needing permission from someone else.</p>

<h3 class="title">Summer Camp in Columbia, SC: Community Style</h3>

<p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/allbrittonpctcelebrate.jpg" width="220" height="159" align="left" alt="Celebration"><a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/stories/v2/15.html" target="_blank">Fast 
    Forward</a> is a community technology center housed at <a href="http://hornet.richlandone.org" target="_blank">Hand 
    Middle School</a> in Columbia, South Carolina.&nbsp; In its three years, Fast 
    Forward has developed a reputation for quality summer camps for children. 
    Each year, the demand has increased, although federal funding has decreased. 
    In 2001, Fast Forward had 240 seats in the summer camps for 5-8<sup>th</sup> 
    graders and waiting lists of up to 10 children for each 20-student summer 
    camp last year. We had to find a way to serve more children. <img src="fall-02_winter-03/PI_Hula_5.jpg" width="288" height="180" align="right"></p>
  <p>With a dream of increasing the number of seats in our summer camps by 100, 
    planning began in June 2001. The first hurdle was how to transform a lab with 
    24 computers and 12 laptops into space for 340 children. The first resource 
    to come through was Hand Middle School. Administrators had an extra lab and 
    two classrooms available. </p>
  <p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/Robotics_Group_3.jpg" width="288" height="136" align="right">An 
    experiment in the summer of 2001, using a high school senior to teach a keyboarding 
    class, gave Fast Forward the possibility of creating a corps of teachers from 
    the local high school. Dreher High School came through with ten juniors and 
    seniors who were willing to train and teach for the summer. In addition, our 
    pool of 16 youth volunteers (5-8<sup>th</sup> graders) swelled to 28.&nbsp; 
    Each youth was willing to work all year and volunteer all summer. Some youth 
    volunteers gave over 300 hours in seven weeks.</p>
  <p>More problems solved: </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div class=Section1> Snacks for each camper, volunteer, and teacher were a 
      substantial expense. Piggly Wiggly, a local grocery store, allowed us to 
      purchase everything at cost and stored the snacks for us&#151;3,000 juice 
      boxes, 10,000 cookies, and 30 pounds of pretzels. </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class=Section1> After-camp care has always been a problem; camps end 
      at 12:00 noon.&nbsp; A meeting with the City Parks and Recreation Department 
      supplied the answer. The City agreed to provide after-camp care at the park 
      across the street until 6:00 p.m. at $20 per week per child. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Fast Forward needed scholarships for students who could 
      not afford the $35 fee. Local businesses and individuals came through with 
      scholarships for the students. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> <i><a
href="http://www.pcteachit.com/" target="_blank">PC Teach It</a> </i>magazine, 
      headquartered in Columbia, provided the supplies for the <i>PC Teach It</i> 
      Camp, along with incentive gifts for students and art and craft supplies 
      for after-camp care at the park.&nbsp; </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> East Coast Special Tees gave t-shirts for the price of 
      the freight when our donated t-shirts turned out to be the wrong size.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Fridays were celebration days. Parents were invited to 
      a Popsicle Party at 11:30 a.m. to see the accomplishments of the week. Some 
      children had no one to come. A call to Shandon Presbyterian Church produced 
      volunteers who came every Friday to celebrate with students who had no one 
      with whom to share. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>Our summer camp schedule was published in April 2002, and seventy percent 
    of the classes were full by the second week. We added <i>more</i> camps&#151;480 
    seats would be available in seven weeks (plus 220 seats for adults -- 700 
    in seven weeks).&nbsp; Sixty to eighty children from every walk of life, every 
    financial background, and every neighborhood joined together each week.&nbsp; 
    Through special funding, a bus brought children from one of the most impoverished 
    areas of Columbia for two weeks of camp. Every zip code in Columbia was represented.</p>
  <p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/Greg_Helping.jpg" width="216" height="162" align="right">Children 
    with special needs, home-schooled children, children with learning disabilities, 
    children from the best neighborhoods in town, children from neighborhoods 
    most people would be afraid to enter all worked together in teams to build 
    robots and make movies. They learned keyboarding and created projects in <i>PC 
    Teach It</i> Camp.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'>When a community comes 
    together, anything can happen.&nbsp; It did in Columbia, South Carolina this 
    summer. It can in your community, too. </p>

<h3 class="title">ScienceQuest for Youth: A Growing Program</h3>

<table width="40%" border="1" align="right">
    <tr> 
      <td> 
        <p><font size="-1">Our goals for all of our youth are the following: we 
          want each child that enters our center to leave with self-confidence, 
          healthy self-esteem, skills associated with social competency, and understanding 
          of the new technology. We find that our children learn better when they 
          are interested in what they are doing. Our youth will benefit from ScienceQuest 
          as an exciting enrichment opportunity; indeed, we hope it may spark 
          further interest to pursue science and math. Expected as well is the 
          development of skills related to life-long learning: team building and 
          social competency, project planning, study and research, creative and 
          critical thinking, and presentation skills.</font></p>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3 class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b>What do you want for the youth in your program?</b> 
  </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While each kid has unique needs, there are some common 
    goals that many of us share, some of which are summed up in the quote above. 
    Center directors and staff aim to provide a wide variety of things to their 
    young clients, often with too few resources and too many needs.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Through <a href="http://www.edc.org/sciencequest" target="_blank">ScienceQuest</a> 
    <a
name="_Hlt23049198"></a> , we have developed a program that supports center staff 
    and volunteers as they reach for these goals with their middle school aged 
    youth (10-14). In the after-school hours, these youth are exploring the insides 
    of volcanoes, communing with lions, and comparing pond water to tap water 
    for health indicators. Others are finding the physics of skateboards, the 
    daytime habits of spiders, or the workings of robots. As part of a small team, 
    each child has the chance to make decisions and to become an information sleuth 
    who presents complex explorations in a well designed website to teach others.&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p>To date, teams all over Boston, in eight surrounding communities, and in 
    thirteen cities nationally have worked on integrating informal science into 
    their technology programs. Over two hundred youth have used their CTCs' tools 
    for learning and presenting information. Eighty-five staff members and volunteers 
    have been trained to guide these project-based explorations, and each receives 
    extensive support during the process. ScienceQuest is funded in part by the 
    <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> 
    and supported by <a href="http://www.edc.org/" target="_blank">Educational 
    Development Center</a> in Newton, MA. Our partners are the community technology 
    centers, business supporters, and science museums. </p>
  <h4><b><img src="fall-02_winter-03/dorsen_discussion.jpg" width="180" height="143" align="right" alt="Three girls">How 
    does ScienceQuest work?</b> </h4>
  <p>The key element to ScienceQuest is the &quot;I Search,&quot; a strategy that 
    many teachers use and that we have adapted to fit the after-school world of 
    CTCs. Through this process, coaches (staff or volunteers, but not science 
    experts) work with a small team of youth through the four stages of investigation. 
    The first stage is &quot;immersion.&quot; As the children explore, they discover 
    for themselves what interests them, what doesn't interest them, and what they 
    want to see next. During the immersion phase, they can try some water xperiments, 
    watch a video on earthquakes, find signs of the coming winter outside the 
    center, or surf the NASA web site.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Then we ask, what did you learn in each of these activities, and what excites 
    you to learn more? Some recent questions have been: </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Have there ever been volcanoes in Brockton, MA?</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <div class=Section1> How do robots work and how do they help people with 
        disabilities? (Roxbury, MA)</div>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> What sorts of bugs are helpful in a garden? (Yonkers, 
      NY)</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> How do the ants outside the center survive in the heat 
      of Texas? (Lufkin, TX)</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> What&#8217;s the nature of the universe? (Chicago, IL)</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p>Once a team has a question that they must answer, the rest of the project 
    unfolds over ten to fifteen weeks. They make a plan that identifies resources 
    to help them find information. Some teams go out of the center on field trips, 
    some talk to experts, and some go onto the Internet to find experiments and 
    information to learn more. As they do this, they are gathering and creating 
    content to build their <a
href="http://www2.edc.org/sciencequest/youth/index.htm" target="_blank">web sites</a>.</p>
  <p>In the past two years, we have noticed a few things: the youth involved often 
    become famous around the center for creating their own web site, and the waiting 
    list for ScienceQuest grows. Other times, we notice kids finishing up a project 
    are simultaneously talking about what they will investigate next. One girl 
    on the <a
href="http://library.thinkquest.org/SQ0110120/" target="_blank">Mane Page</a> 
    <a
name="_Hlt23049366"></a> team, investigating lions, talked about her questions 
    about rabbits, since her grandmother keeps rabbits. Bob Hamilton, the coach 
    at Ministry in Action in Lufkin, TX, reported that the kids are asking for 
    more time in the center to finish their project, since twice a week is not 
    enough.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><img src="fall-02_winter-03/dorsen_animaldrawing.jpg" width="450" height="313" alt="My Dog Helps Me"></b></p>
  <p>The youth can talk eloquently about what they have done and what they have 
    learned, and their confidence shows through. While we do not have the capacity 
    for following the youth through high school and into their post-graduation 
    choices, we do know that youth engaged in quality after-school programs are 
    more likely to graduate and have a positive attitude about learning and school. 
    They show better group skills and make smarter choices about health and activities, 
    according to the National Institute on Out-of-School Time (<a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WCW/CRW/SAC" target="_blank">NIOST</a>). 
    The youth in our centers live in complex worlds with increasingly complex 
    goals for their future success. Through ScienceQuest, youth explore, learn, 
    have fun and get ever closer to becoming successful adults with a deep understanding 
    of their world.</p>
  <p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/dorsen_marquis3.jpg" width="144" height="114" align="right" alt="Marquis">The 
    <a href="http://www.edc.org/sciencequest" target="_blank">ScienceQuest</a> 
    <a

    youth web projects, answers to common questions, and a soon to be launched 
    section of the site for youth. We hope that you will try a ScienceQuest project 
    on your own or apply to attend one of our workshops at the next CTCNet conference!</p>

<h3 class="title">Transforming Rural Alaska through Wireless Technology in the Schools and Community</h3>

<P><IMG align=left alt="Village of Bethel" height=128 src="fall-02_winter-03/Bethel_Village.gif" width=275></P>
<P>In remote Alaskan villages, the public school is usually the center of the community.&nbsp; Often the largest building, the school frequently functions as a town meeting hall, a recreation center, the town library, and&#8212;in the past few years&#8212;the technology hub.&nbsp; Through the <A href="http://www.sl.universalservice.org/" target=_blank>Universal Services Fund</A> <A name=_Hlt23047637></A>or "E-Rate,"a federal program that helps make telecommunications equipment and services affordable for rural and disadvantaged schools, Alaskan students and teachers have high-speed Internet access in the most remote villages.</P>
<P>Broadband Internet in the schools has not only given teachers more resources to better educate students and engage them in learning, it has helped to transform many remote Alaskan towns by providing better access to news and information, improving communications with family and friends, and making fundamental tasks such as shopping quicker and easier.&nbsp; Even though federal regulations have in the past prohibited the use of the E-Rate funded telecommunications equipment and services by any entity other than the school, the positive impact of the improved technology has snowballed and now affects the entire village.&nbsp; </P>

<P>Before 1998, Joy Hamilton, one of three teachers in the <A href="http://szshx.shx.iasd.gcisa.net/" target=_blank>Innoko River School</A><A name=_Hlt23047781></A><A name=_Hlt535062767></A><A name=_Hlt535062761></A>, a multi-grade K-12 school in Shageluk, Alaska accessible only by air or water, had little access to teaching resources for the 30+ students.&nbsp; The 130-resident community received the daily newspaper days after publication and possessed only a small school library that shelved about 500 outdated books, selected at the discretion of the previous teacher.&nbsp; Eight years ago, when she wanted to have her high school students complete a research paper on world inventors, she could not find a single book to use.&nbsp; A few years later, a $6/hour dial-up connection and spotty, unreliable access enabled Hamilton to receive text-based information, and to communicate with a New Hampshire-based teacher named Bill Hollis, who hosted the website.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In 1998, <A href="http://www.gci.com/" target=_blank>General Communication, Inc.</A> (GCI), an Alaskan-based telecommunications company with expertise in delivering Internet services to rural schools, helped the school to apply for&#8212;and win&#8212;federal funding to upgrade their primitive connections.&nbsp; Through E-Rate funding, the Innoko River School received a satellite dish and server from GCI as well as 24x7 support from a team of education technology specialists, e-mail, content filtering, web hosting, caching and network authentication&#8212;all services bundled within a GCI product called "<A href="http://www.schoolaccess.net/" target=_blank>SchoolAccess</A>."</P>

<P>Hamilton also has her students track the progress of other key animals in Alaska life&#8212;migratory species.&nbsp; With broadband Internet, Hamilton can better engage her students in education programs such as <A href="http://www.learner.org/jnorth" target=_blank>Journey North</A>, a national Annenberg Foundation project that teaches students about migration, enables them to track the paths of migratory species, share their field observations via email with students across the Hemisphere, and learn directly from scientific experts who work with the students.&nbsp; Mostly Deg Hitan (Native Alaskans from this area) who rely on subsistence activities, the students learn about a topic relevant to their way of life in a way that incorporates myriad academic disciplines&#8212;language arts, social studies, science and math&#8212;to create a well-rounded lesson.</P>
<P>Hamilton also enhances her curriculum through current events, which especially since September 11<SUP>th</SUP> and its aftermath, provide a critical basis for classroom lessons.&nbsp; Before the advent of Internet access, students, teachers and the rest of the Shageluk community received national and worldwide news late as the daily newspaper is delivered several days after its publication and the one television station frequently fails to work.&nbsp; The ability to instantly access news sources and live web casts from around the globe has reduced isolation and help to engage students in world events.&nbsp; "They now know&#8212;and care&#8212;about what's going on," notes Hamilton.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P>Karl Kowalski, a technology coordinator in <A href="http://www.nwarctic.org/" target=_blank>the Northwest Arctic Borough School District</A>, located in one of the most remote areas of Alaska, most of which is above the Arctic Circle, agrees. "Students are more engaged in learning, excited about school, and have a greater awareness of the larger world." Teachers in his school also use the Internet in a variety of ways to provide more hands-on learning for students, especially with a program called "<A href="http://www.epals.com/" target=_blank>E-Pals</A>."&nbsp; With E-Pals students interact via email and discuss current events, sports, climate and cultural differences, while they practice their writing.&nbsp; "Students learn lessons unavailable in any textbook," continues Kowalski.&nbsp; Landon Shuster, a middle school student in Kotzebue, provides a case in point. "I started a stock market simulation game that I couldn't have done without the Internet.&nbsp; I think it's a lot easier to check your stocks on the Internet than by phone or radio.&nbsp; The Internet at school gives me the ability to do that."</P>

<P>For most Americans, the Internet provides quicker and easier access to information they have always enjoyed through television, daily newspapers, and the telephone.&nbsp; For remote Alaskans, however, the Internet functions as their window to the outside world and provides a wealth of information previously unavailable to them.</P>
<P>It is difficult for people in the "Lower 48"&#8212;what Alaskans like to call the continental U.S.&#8212;to understand exactly the remoteness of Alaskan towns and the vastness of the state.&nbsp; One-fifth the size of the continental U.S., Alaska dwarfs the state of Texas or a good percentage of Western Europe.&nbsp; A limited highway system makes travel by air and sea the requisite means of transportation.&nbsp; Remote Alaskan residents often lack phone lines, television access and running water&#8212;basics many Americans take for granted.&nbsp; In Shageluk, for example, just over half of the residents have phone lines, the single TV station works sporadically, and a central washeteria provides the entire town facilities for bathing and laundry&#8212;yet despite this, it has broadband Internet access through the school.</P>
<P>And the technology benefits have not stopped at the schoolhouse door.&nbsp; Teachers and students have worked hard to include the community in their technology efforts.&nbsp; Students, with Hamilton's guidance, design, operate, and manage the school and community web site.&nbsp; They also tutor adults on the computer after hours to help them learn to surf the Internet, send email, order clothes and books online, and check the weather, a critical capability when one relies on small airplanes for travel. A recent examination of the most visited web sites in Shageluk, in fact, showed Aviation Weather, Anchorage Daily News and CNN at the top of the list.</P>

<P>But residents in the Iditarod Area School District enjoy more than just the capability to research and read the news.&nbsp; Three years ago, the district started Project PROMISE, an initiative funded through the U.S. Department of Education's <A href="http://www.ed.gov/21stcclc" target=_blank>21st Century Community Learning Center (CLC) Program</A> that provides academic, recreational and cultural enrichment for children and life-long learning opportunities for community members.&nbsp; With nearly $900,000 for the program, the district hired a technology specialist who taught onsite computer courses such as Excel and Word and helped students and community members take online courses through the University of Alaska Southeast, available through the broadband Internet access.</P>
<P>In McGrath, a town of 400 and the district center for the Iditarod Area School District, the excitement for technology exploded from the kids to the parents and the rest of the community.&nbsp; When high-speed Internet access first became available, the lines outside the school community library snaked around the hallway at night.&nbsp; Sparked by their experience with Internet access and computers in the schools, more residents of McGrath decided they wanted computers and Internet in the home.&nbsp; Slowly but surely the cow-motif boxes, a signature of Gateway, increasingly decorated local delivery shipments and the local power company began to offer dial-up and wireless Internet access to residents.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Visions of life in Alaska intrigue and amaze most residents of the continental U.S.&#8212;it's the Alaskan mystique.&nbsp; The remote vastness, the unadulterated landscape and the resilient people occupy an important place in the nation's collective consciousness.&nbsp; Through the technological advancements that have taken place in Alaska, not only have the remote residents of this unique state earned more about world events, the world has learned more about them and their inimitable lives. </P>

<h3 class="title">Mapping and Community Organizing in Philadelphia</h3>

<P align=left><IMG height=97 src="fall-02_winter-03/hoffman.pacdcogo.gif" width=288 align=left>Since 1995, the <A href="http://www.pacdc.org/">Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporation</A> (PACDC) has used wireless handheld technology for its member CDCs' neighborhood-based data collection efforts. Early in 2001, PACDC launched a more ambitious program, acquiring a small fleet of Compaq iPAQ Pocket PCs and distributing them to CDCs that were creating neighborhood inventories of their service areas. The primary objectives of the Pocket Neighborhood Inventory System (NIS), the software application developed by PACDC to process collected data, are to increase the quality of data collected by CDCs by standardizing data collection for citywide comparability and to establish a basis for measuring changes in the neighborhood over time. The Pocket NIS is merely a tool for gathering information; however, the exercise itself has provided CDCs with valuable knowledge in their strategic planning, community outreach efforts, and development of policy initiatives.</P>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align=left>Proactive Neighborhood Strategic Planning</H3>
<P>Neighborhood planning is a process whereby community representatives are brought together to raise concerns and needs, identify strengths and assets, establish goals for improving the neighborhood, and provide recommendations for realizing those goals. By taking a proactive approach to the planning process, CDCs can better understand neighborhood dynamics, prioritize and target resources, and make informed decisions about issues before they become problems. One recent illustration of proactive strategic planning involved a blight reduction project by <A href="http://www.projecthome.org/">Project H.O.M.E.</A>, a CDC that provides transitional housing for homeless men and single mothers. The stated goal of this project was to "stabilize up to one acre of land, within designated communities, by clearing and re-vegetating underutilized publicly-owned open space."</P>
<TABLE width=23 align=left border=1>

<TD><FONT size=-1>A conceptual plan for Project H.O.M.E. advocates restructuring blocks with older two-story rowhouses (courtesy Brown & Keener/Lager Raabe Skafte).</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Project H.O.M.E. elected to conduct a neighborhood inventory based on several departmental databases they had compiled. The databases revealed inconsistencies and other inaccuracies. The most common errors were typographical with variations on the format of property addresses. These errors add to the processing time needed to prepare the data for analysis and mapping. The Pocket NIS reduces response errors during data collection because elements in the survey are structured from predefined lists and checkboxes. Eliminating paper also significantly reduces the survey time by decreasing the number of steps involved in conducting a survey. As well, the Pocket NIS contains necessary geographic identifiers making the transition from the database to maps, tables, and charts a simpler process.</P>
<P>Utilizing the data collected from their neighborhood inventory, the project steering committee and community representatives selected several clusters of vacant lots for cleaning-and-greening, lots covering eight square blocks of the target area. The sites were chosen for their high visibility and low maintenance that could be used as leverage in "creating enduring patterns of land use and development that will stimulate investment and encourage long-time residents to remain in their neighborhoods." The sites were cleared of refuse and were landscaped in August 2001.</P>
<P>The project focused primarily on open space issues; however, the steering committee and community residents had identified high concentrations of abandoned property in rows of older two-story houses in drafts of maps of the inventory data. Older two-story houses are not viable rehabilitation candidates when more gracious larger homes are readily available for low upfront cost. Houses with small livable areas and no yards are also not attractive to prospective homebuyers. The resulting strategic plan advocates that these blocks be restructured as part of a homeownership project which would demolish structures to decrease densities and create open space for yards and off-street parking, and adjoin adjacent two-story structures to increase livable space per unit. </P>

<P>In developing a neighborhood strategic plan, it is necessary to strengthen neighborhood relationships and make a concerted effort to enlist residents to buy-in to the community development process. Building a sense of empowerment in the neighborhood is absolutely crucial to sustaining community projects after a CDC has completed development. The <A name=_Hlt23528150></A><A href="http://www.pacdc.org/cgi-bin/board.cgi?WCRP">Women's Community Revitalization Project (WCRP)</A> <A name=_Hlt23528165></A><A name=_Hlt23528249></A><A name=_Hlt23528139></A><A name=_Hlt23528301></A>, a CDC that focuses on physical development and advocacy as ways for revitalizing communities in which low-income women and their families live, recently completed an open space management project that involved community participation in each step of the planning and implementation process.</P>
<P>WCRP conducted a survey of residents to identify environmental concerns and to evaluate WCRP's previous open space projects. The issue raised in these sessions was the illegal dumping of trash and the rat infestation that resulted from the associated dumping. </P>
<P>WCRP supplemented the survey with a neighborhood inventory. Since they employed interns and volunteers to do the surveying, it was important that the survey instrument be simple and easy to navigate. The Pocket NIS is intended for use by persons with minimal computer experience. The application is designed to be flexible along a wide range of topics including evaluating the structural condition of property, compiling business data for commercial development, and cataloguing natural resources for open space management. Unnecessary survey elements are hidden from the surveyor to reduce the potential for confusion. Related survey elements are grouped together which leads to greater consistency of responses. An extensive HTML-based help file is contained as a feature of the Pocket NIS to assist in solving questions that may arise in the field. The file provides a definition for each survey element, a description of responses, and a photo. </P>
<P>The analysis of WCRP's neighborhood inventory identified potential greening projects centered on resolving these issues. Residents prioritized sites for cleaning and greening as publicly owned vacant lots located near established WCRP developments and community anchors because of ease of management, residential interest, and the ability to build on relationships in the neighborhood. Enthusiastic residents were educated in water, soil, and lead issues and trained in other maintenance issues. Access to gardening tools and materials for planting were provided to complete the process.</P>
<P>As planned, WCRP is no longer directly involved in this project. They have begun the process of identifying future initiatives to extend their record of creating more than 70 projects, all of which serve as examples of residential resolve. In the final report, neighborhood residents credit WCRP for supporting the community's effort to reclaim vacant land by "creating a neighborhood wide interest in the environment" and getting residents to invest in their community beyond their block and "providing fertile ground for leadership to take root in the community."</P>
<H3>Partners in Citywide Initiatives and Policy Change</H3>
<P>While implementing strategies for change in their own neighborhoods will always be central to the work of CDCs, there is recognition that CDCs also need to think more broadly about their initiatives. The <A href="http://www.newkensingtoncdc.com/">New Kensington Community Development Corporation</A> established a neighborhood-based open space management program in 1996 to address the growing problem of urban vacant land. The long-term goal of the multi-year effort was to "create an effective system for managing and maintaining every vacant parcel in the <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 /><st1:City><st1:place>New Kensington</st1:place></st1:City> target area." The project was unique in that it enlisted support from a number of city institutions. The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society provided technical assistance and conducted workshops; the Department of Licenses & Inspections cleared the lots of trash; the Office of Housing and Community Development provided funding; and the Redevelopment Authority facilitated the land acquisition process.</P>

<P>A starting point in the project was to compile a vacant land inventory to identify ownership and the condition of vacant land and to develop a strategy to promote vacant land reuse. Because the project steering committee intended to replicate this model for other neighborhoods, they recognized that standardizing inventory data for citywide comparability would be important in documenting the success of this and future projects. Once a benchmark is established, a set of indicators must be constructed to monitor the changes that take place in the neighborhood. Following data collection with the Pocket NIS, a copy of the completed database was provided to the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName>Pennsylvania</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>'s <A href="http://cml.upenn.edu/">Cartographic Modeling Laboratory</A> (CML) who has developed a web-based <A href="http://cml.upenn.edu/nis">Neighborhood Information System</A> (NIS). The neighborhood data has been integrated with other data sets from City of <st1:City><st1:place>Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:City> agencies. Authorized users of the <st1:City><st1:place>NIS</st1:place></st1:City> can generate maps and reports of selected properties and create summary tables of their neighborhood. New Kensington CDC refers to this resource when researching the feasibility of their next development project</P>
<P>To date, New Kensington CDC has reclaimed 60% of the 1,100 vacant parcels in the neighborhood transferring land to adjacent homeowners for gardens, private "sideyards," and off street parking. The <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Community</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Garden</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType>Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> is supported by local residents and offers free compost, soil, and mulch. An After School Club works with local students to develop a responsible attitude toward natural resources. New Kensington CDCs program received a HUD Best Practices Award in 1999 and the model has since been implemented in two additional <st1:City><st1:place>Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:City> neighborhoods.</P>
<H3 style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align=left>Conclusion</H3>
<P>By summer's end, twelve CDCs had utilized the Pocket NIS for conducting inventories of their neighborhood in 2002. Wireless handheld technology has streamlined and strengthened the neighborhood data collection process and has succeeded in generating interest among other CDCs and neighborhood-based organizations in better documenting their activities. This low-cost, high-tech tool has allowed CDCs to think more strategically, expand participation in the planning process, and enlist other agencies as partners in progress in revitalizing neighborhoods in <st1:City><st1:place>Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:City>.</P>

<h3 class="title">Edna Jackson, Technology And Community Building: From Staunchest Opponent to Greatest Proponent</h3>

<p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/pinkett_pinkett.jpg" width="135" height="197" align="left">This 
    article shares the case study of one individual in her efforts to achieve 
    social and cultural resonance with technology. She is a participant 
    in the Creating Community Connections (C3) Project,* an ongoing effort at 
    <a
href="http://www.camfieldestates.net/" target="_blank">Camfield Estates</a>, a 
    predominantly African-American, low- to moderate-income housing development 
    in Roxbury, MA, since 1999. As part of this project, MIT researchers 
    worked with residents to establish a technological infrastructure by offering 
    every family a new computer, software, and high-speed Internet connection, 
    along with comprehensive training and a web-based community building system.</p>
  <h3>The Case Study of Edna Jackson</h3>
  <p>Edna and James Jackson (both pseudonyms) arrived at the housing development 
    in 1990. For the next seven years leading up to the eventual demolition 
    of the property in 1997, their attachment to the neighborhood grew stronger 
    as the development became their home. In 1999, after renovation was 
    completed, the Jacksons enthusiastically decided to return to the development 
    given their longstanding ties to the community. However, their return 
    to the development was somewhat bittersweet as Edna was now battling chronic 
    obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a combination of emphysema (over-inflation 
    of the structures in the lungs leading to decreased respiratory function) 
    and chronic bronchitis (inflammation of the tubes connecting the windpipe 
    and the lungs that obstructs airflow), a disease that claims the lives of 
    approximately 100,000 Americans each year.</p>
  <p>Having been diagnosed with COPD three years earlier, Edna's days at the new 
    development would largely be confined to her residence. Now at age 57, 
    she relies on an oxygen machine to provide constant respiratory assistance 
    and uses a walker on the rare occasions when she leaves the house (usually 
    to go to the hospital).</p>
  <h3>Reluctance, Recruitment and Resonance</h3>
  <p>From the onset, Edna was the project's staunchest opponent. When the 
    President of the tenants association first spoke with Edna, she flatly refused 
    the offer for the computer, Internet access, and home-based training. 
    Subsequent efforts by the President, a representative from the financier of 
    the property, and other residents at the development also fell upon deaf ears. 
    Meanwhile, the new computer intended for Edna sat in a corner of the community 
    center gathering dust. Eventually, Edna was convinced to allow someone 
    to set up the computer and Internet connection in her home, but only on a 
    trial basis.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left'>When we moved 
    back and this building was done and I heard that we were going to get computers, 
    I didn't care why. I didn't want one. And I told [them] I didn't 
    want one. I was really disgusted with it all.</p>
  <p>Rather quickly, the instructor was able to engage her. He did this 
    not by showing her how to use the mouse or the keyboard per se, but by clearly 
    demonstrating relevance. Initially this meant showing her how to connect 
    with family and friends, which struck a definite chord.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left'>I got my first 
    session and I was amazed! I couldn't believe it! It was so fascinating! 
    I get my second session and I'm getting e-mail, which was totally blowing 
    my mind. And I'm saying, "Oh my God, this is incredible."</p>
  <p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/pinkett_camfield1.jpg" width="150" height="266" align="right">With 
    each passing day, Edna became increasingly more comfortable with the computer. 
    However, the majority of her tasks still involved pointing and clicking. 
    Her first jaunt beyond e-mail, web sites, and games was participating in a 
    chat room on cancer (she is also a survivor of breast cancer). Given 
    her positive experiences thus far, she far she didn't hesitate entering the 
    chat room and "watching" the conversation take place among the participants. 
    In fact, her early experiences with chat rooms were characterized by watching 
    the conversations of others as she was reluctant to contribute to the dialog. 
    And then one day everything changed. A question was posted in the chat 
    room for which she knew the answer, and, slowly but surely, she found the 
    courage to post a response. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left'>So now I type 
    it in. It looked OK. And I sent it. I had the nerve. 
    It's like I was covering over my eyes. I was so afraid that someone 
    would say, "What's this jerk? Who's this jerk? What's she 
    talking about?" So now the person said, "Thanks Edna you cleared 
    that up." I was so happy I didn't know what to do! I got 
    up and I actually did a dance! You know when the football players do 
    a...when they get a touchdown? I got up and did a dance just like those 
    football players! When you are sick there is not much to celebrate.</p>
  <p>Edna soon found herself in various chat rooms on a regular basis. She 
    spent as many as nine hours per day on the computer and says, "I remember 
    one time our lights went out and the only thing I was interested in...I didn't 
    care about the food in the refrigerator, I wanted to be on the computer." 
    She began to see herself as an advisor, confidant, and sounding board for 
    others. She shared her thoughts about cancer, about COPD, and about 
    life. On making this transition from passive bystander to active contributor 
    she remarks, "It's so rewarding. And to be able to give...I'm not 
    only getting, I am giving because I can tell them my experiences."</p>
  <h3>A Social and Cultural Shift</h3>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="fall-02_winter-03/pinkett_camfield3.jpg" width="333" height="231"></td>

      <td>
        <div align="center">Camfield Estates</div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>A cultural shift has taken place in the Jackson's household. Attitudes 
    have changed. Habits have changed. Ways of perceiving the world 
    have changed. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left'>I would have 
    never wanted a computer. I didn't see anything in it. Now I wouldn't 
    know what to do without it. I believe I am better physically and mentally 
    because of the computer.</p>
  <p>A social shift has also taken place. An environment that was once closed-off 
    to the outside world in certain ways has now been reopened. Connections 
    are being made that previously didn't exist and, in fact, weren't possible.</p>
  <p>After completing approximately ten sessions with her instructors, Edna had 
    to temporarily postpone their visits for health-related reasons. However, 
    that has not prevented her from continuing to explore new arenas. </p>
  <p>There are three competencies Edna has developed in her still embryonic exposure 
    to digital technologies. First, she has developed a sense of empowerment 
    as evidenced by her frequent references to having greater control of her life. 
    Second, she has developed a renewed faith in her capacity to learn. 
    Third, she has experienced a shift and transformation in her thinking with 
    respect to computers and the Internet. Whereas in the past she saw no 
    relationship between herself and these technologies due to unfamiliarity and 
    consternation, she is able to reflect on that experience and realize that, 
    now, the connection is very clear.</p>
  <h3>Community Technology and Community Building</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:left'>Community technology, 
    and in particular community building, are fundamentally local, shared social 
    and cultural processes. Edna Jackson's story is certainly one that incorporates 
    notions of community, but in a more distant sense as well. Her interactions 
    have largely been centered on a "community of interest" (i.e., cancer 
    survivors) as opposed to a "community of practice" (i.e., the housing 
    development), and her online activity has established global as well as neighborhood 
    ties (excluding family). Is the community better off as a result of 
    her experience? I reply with a resounding, "Yes."</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:left'>On one hand, Edna 
    has reached out to others in the community to the best of her ability. 
    On the other hand, the more important lesson is that the community reached 
    out to her. As a result of that outreach, Edna's and her husband's quality-of-life 
    have improved, and for that reason alone, the community has improved, too. 
    Her story demonstrates how technology can serve as a tool to break down walls, 
    open doors, and reinvigorate life. More importantly, her story illustrates 
    how the collective efforts of a community can open up new possibilities for 
    one of its longstanding members. Thanks to the consolidated efforts 
    of neighbors and caring staff at the development, one of the project's staunchest 
    opponents is now, quite possibly, its greatest proponent.</p>

<h3 class="title">Sweet, Sweet $ustainability</h3>

<p>My work brings me into contact with hundreds of Washington State-based community 
    technology programs (&quot;CTPs&quot;), and they are all working on serious 
    sustainability issues. I work on the <a
href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/cat" target="_blank">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates 
    Foundation's Community Access to Technology (CAT) Program</a>, and as such, 
    I represent an impermanent step on the path to sustainability.&nbsp; With 
    each proposal, however, would-be grantees and I both wrestle with issues of 
    long-term sustainability.&nbsp; What will make an organization's technology 
    project sustainable in the long term? The jury is still out. Actually, I'm 
    not even sure they've seen all the evidence yet.</p>
  <h3>Centers or Programs?</h3>
  <p>As this field matures, sustainability is certainly one of the questions of 
    the day. In many ways, it begs another question&#151;what is the long-term 
    purpose of community technology programs? Like dentists encouraging everyone 
    to brush and floss, should they be trying to put themselves out of business 
    by eliminating the problem they are there to address? Or will CTPs always 
    be with us, dealing with the changing ranks of the digitally divided, and 
    the changing nature of technology?</p>
  <p>My feeling is that nonprofit-run technology programs will be with us for 
    some time, if not effectively forever. I'm less sure about the fates of &quot;stand 
    alone&quot; CTCs. In Washington State, where CAT does all its grantmaking, 
    very few community technology programs are run out of organizations that have 
    a mission built around technology access, and I don't suspect the national 
    scene is much different. Of the 50 or so grantees of CAT, only two or three 
    are CTCNet members. In other words, a CTCNet membership does not seem pertinent 
    to the vast majority of CTPs out there. In my experience, the vast majority 
    of CTPs work with an organization's specific client set, rather than being 
    open to the public at large. This, plus not seeing their organization's mission 
    as being &quot;about technology,&quot; and certainly not thinking of themselves 
    as a &quot;technology center,&quot; all distance them from CTCNet.&nbsp; This 
    is a shame, since there would be much for them to gain from membership.&nbsp; 
    If CTCNet could morph into something useful to these organizations, CTCNet 
    could be a meaningful player in making CTPs sustainable. At present, it is 
    not.</p>
  <h3>Plan A</h3>
  <p>Working on the assumption that most technology programs are part of larger 
    (non-technology oriented) organizations, the basic philosophy should be that 
    technology costs need to be thought of as just one line item in the general 
    operations budget of an organization, not a &quot;special project&quot; cost.&nbsp; 
    As such, making CTPs sustainable is really no different than any exercise 
    in nonprofit sustainability. You need an effective fundraising plan and diversified 
    sources of income. If humanly possible, you need to make your organization 
    or program entirely non-dependent on fickle grantmakers. I estimate that there 
    are only a few years left where most private grantmakers will be seduced by 
    the allure of &quot;technology projects&quot; &#151;expect fundraising to 
    get a lot harder if you are basing your argument for funding primarily on 
    technology access in the years ahead.</p>
  <h3>Blah, Blah, Blah</h3>
  <p>All the standard methods of promoting sustainability are covered in some 
    depth in the City of Seattle's &quot;<a
href="http://www.cityofseattle.net/tech/ctc/default.htm" target="_blank">Sustainability 
    Strategies for Community Technology Centers in Seattle</a>,&quot; authored 
    by the Environmental Health and Social Policy Center. Not to knock this report 
    unduly (it is a workman-like recitation of all the elements that would help 
    to make any nonprofit sustainable), but for the most part it fails to meet 
    its own goals of &quot;finding strategies that will help place...CTCs on a 
    path to sustainable operations&quot; and in finding whether &quot;strategies 
    that work at one CTC (can) be successfully applied by others.&quot; Unless 
    you have been operating a technology center under a rock for the past ten 
    years, nothing much in this report will surprise you (however, if you are 
    just thinking of starting a CTP, this report is a great primer on common issues 
    and well-known broad strategies for survival). </p>
  <p><br>
    Likewise, Industry Canada's report on &quot;<a
href="http://www.ecommons.ca/stage/main.phtml?css=100&amp;section=research&amp;show=cap" target="_blank">A 
    Picture of the Community Access Program of Industry Canada</a> <a
name="_Hlt23057116"></a><a name="_Hlt23057178"></a><a name="_Hlt23057196"></a><a
name="_Hlt23057150"></a><a name="_Hlt23057006"></a><a name="_Hlt23057073"></a><a
name="_Hlt23057001"></a> &quot; tries to address the issue of sustainability head 
    on. Many of the conclusions they reach echo the Seattle report on best practices 
    towards generic sustainability: community buy-in and participation, serving 
    local needs, leadership, partnerships, and effective marketing, to name a 
    few.&nbsp; </p>
  <h3>The (Un)Holy Grail&#151;Cash</h3>
  <p>What I keep hoping that I will find in these reports are studies showing 
    specific effective non-grants-based strategies for keeping your CTP going. 
    Alas, this is not there. At the last CTCNet Conference there was some talk 
    of trying to develop a research agenda for the field. If this is realized, 
    I sincerely hope that <i>useful</i> sustainability research will be on the 
    agenda.&nbsp; Given the lack of actual research to rely on, what follows are 
    my thoughts and musings on the subject. </p>
  <p>Substantial earned income needs to be the goal of every CTP&#151;this is 
    a trend in the nonprofit sector generally. If you think that commerce is evil, 
    get over it. Nothing says independence like your own income stream. The trick 
    is making it work with your mission. As such, there do seem to be some opportunities 
    for CTCs and CTPs to make a buck and do good at the same time. </p>
  <p>The Industry Canada report lists a few interesting examples: one CTC built 
    a digital recording studio into its center; another acts as a publishing center 
    for its host organization, putting out retail items like calendars, cookbooks, 
    and local history books; others design web pages for government and nonprofit 
    clients for a fee. Part of the key here is that they feel okay charging a 
    fee for enhanced services &#151;they don't feel obliged to give everything 
    away for free. The Seattle report also lists some fee-for-service concepts 
    that have been implemented: substantial class fees for high-end training curriculum; 
    a fee-based computer repair service, and sales of donated, refurbished computers.&nbsp; 
    I love these on-the-ground examples (no, your CTC/CTP doesn't have to become 
    a competitive ISP to survive), and more needs to be written about them.&nbsp; 
    Contact info for these projects is in the reports. Give 'em a call.</p>
  <p>Actuall<u>y</u> adding something to this area of inquiry is a recent Summit 
    Collaborative report called <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/ctctechprovreport.html" target="_blank">&quot;Community 
    Technology Centers as Technology Assistance Providers to Nonprofit &amp; Community 
    Based Organizations.&quot;</a> It profiles several technology organizations 
    that are looking to make money by providing technology consulting and other 
    services to other local nonprofits.&nbsp; While larger cities may already 
    have someone covering this area (<a href="http://www.npower.org" target="_blank">NPower</a> 
    would be one example of this sort of provider), most mid-size cities and smaller 
    towns do not have someone providing this service, opening up an on-mission 
    earned income opportunity for community technology organizations.</p>
  <p>We also need to be unafraid to learn from other nonprofit sectors. I just 
    picked up a new book by Andy Robinson called <i>Selling Social Change (Without 
    Selling Out</i>).&nbsp; I'm only on page 7, but he's already given one great 
    case study about a nonprofit that promotes bicycling as a transportation alternative. 
    They earn 100% of their annual $200,000 budget through earned income sources 
    such as full service (full-priced) repairs, lower-cost assisted self-repairs, 
    selling refurbished bikes from donated parts, and an innovative international 
    linkages program with Guatemala.&nbsp; Sound familiar?&nbsp; Is this the sort 
    of program that most CTCs/CTPs could run, but with computers instead of bikes? 
    You bet. [My apologies if there is already this exact program operational 
    out there. I have not heard of you yet.&nbsp; If you are making $200,000/year, 
    you should get the word out!]&nbsp; If you have not read it, you might also 
    check out Bill Shore's<i> The Cathedral Within</i> for some inspirational 
    stories on how some larger nonprofits have succeeded in a big way at the earned 
    income game. Shore lays out the institutional backing and will that needs 
    to be behind larger income-earning projects.</p>
  <h3>Take a Chance</h3>
  <p>I don't mean to downplay entirely the other tactics that can be used to edge 
    toward sustainability. One I am seeing more and more are links with high school 
    or community college students for credit/volunteer opportunities, especially 
    around technical support issues and lab staffing.&nbsp; Innovative partnerships, 
    especially at the moment of program inception, can be particularly powerful.&nbsp; 
    A CAT grantee, <a
href="http://www.pnt.org/" target="_blank">the Pacific Northwest Trail Association</a>, 
    formulated their CTP in such a way that they had financial commitments secured 
    from every layer of government imaginable before launching their project (federal&#151;provides 
    transportation; state&#151;laid fiber for connectivity; school district&#151;donated 
    space) in exchange for access and services from PNTA. Now they are developing 
    an earned income enterprise based on growing and selling native plants for 
    environmental rehabilitation projects, facilitated in part by their computer 
    center.&nbsp; And no, they don't have a large staff or a million dollar budget, 
    they are, in fact, located in tiny Sedro-Wolley, Washington.&nbsp; Unlike 
    nearly every other funder on the planet, I do not think that partnerships 
    and &quot;leveraging&quot; are a long-term sustainability plan, even though 
    the PNW Trail Association story is a great one.</p>
  <p>For many years, I worked for a small nonprofit. I know that time and dollars 
    are short and tight in that environment, and it's not often easy to take a 
    chance. But some thought to on-the-ground earned income experimentation needs 
    to happen in the CTC/CTP space, and soon. And the word needs to get out, both 
    about successes and failures. If you are running a CTP, read the reports and 
    books I mentioned, and lobby CTCNet, or ACC, or someone, to produce useful 
    studies on replicable earned income projects. Mostly, do not wait for funders 
    to come to your rescue.&nbsp; Foundations are great at many things, but not 
    at covering the ongoing costs of running an organization, and they are not 
    renowned for their patience or decades-long commitments.&nbsp; As &quot;venture 
    philanthropy&quot; and other trends from the business world take hold more 
    firmly, expect funders to be looking for evidence and data on how you will 
    survive without them.</p>

<h3 class="title">Online Fundraising Comes of Age</h3>

<P>Many of us recall the announcement by President Bush, encouraging Americans from all walks of life to visit Helping.org, RedCross.org and other online sites to donate generously.&nbsp; According to a March 21, 2002, Chronicle of Philanthropy article by Nicole Wallace, over $215 million of the more than $2 billion collected altogether was donated online. Online fundraising had come of age.</P>
<P>One year later, online fundraising has continued to evolve.&nbsp; Here are four trends that are notable during this past year.</P>
<H3>Trend One: Small and medium-size nonprofits are making a commitment to online fundraising, many for the first time.</H3>
<P>Small and medium-size nonprofits have made notable investments in online fundraising systems, most frequently by putting "Donate Now" buttons on their web sites to solicit direct contributions from supporters.&nbsp; Organizations such as <A href="http://www.networkforgood.org/" target=_blank>Network for Good</A> (formerly operating as Helping.org and currently run by AOL Time Warner, Cisco and Yahoo) have been influential in encouraging this with their free -- though feature-light -- donation button service.&nbsp; Other fee-based services such as <A href="http://www.egrants.org/" target=_blank>eGrants.org</A>, <A href="http://www.entango.com/" target=_blank>Entango Corporation</A>, <A href="http://www.donate.net/" target=_blank>Donate.net</A>, <A href="http://www.etapestry.com/" target=_blank>eTapestry.com</A> and others have continued to acquire nonprofit customers, building the trend.&nbsp; This trend has grown because nonprofits continue to seek new sources of income, and are (finally) convinced that the effort of setting up a donation button is worth the return on investment.&nbsp; The events of September 11 appear to have influenced their thinking that donors are now comfortable with giving online.&nbsp; An economic downturn, coupled with budget cutbacks at foundations, has been another motivating factor that is encouraging experimentation.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A href="http://www.commercialalert.org/" target=_blank>Commercial Alert</A> in Portland, Oregon, is a good example.&nbsp; With a broad mission of keeping commercial culture within its proper sphere, they've had their hands full recently.&nbsp; Recent campaigns have included challenging corporate marketing in public schools and campaigning UNICEF to cancel McDonald's World Children's Day. "We're getting a lot of good press recently," says Commercial Alert Executive Director Gary Ruskin. "We're expanding and growing as a result of the exposure. We did our first targeted direct mail campaign in April and May 2002, and encouraged people to support us. We redid our web site to improve the look and layout, and we figured out how to hook up the eGrants.org DonateNow! button."&nbsp; Their May online donations totaled $1,100, June was $1,800, and numbers have stayed over $1,000 each month.&nbsp; "Online gifts are only about 5% of our total gifts as a result of this direct mail campaign, and we hear that's pretty normal. We figure that some donors visit our web site after they get the direct mail piece to learn more about us, and then give online because it's convenient. Our goal is to get the word out about our work, and make it easy for people to give in whatever way they're comfortable." </P>
<H3>Trend Two: Larger nonprofits are making significant infrastructure investments in membership management systems.</H3>
<P>Larger nonprofits have signed up in droves with integrated membership management systems, offered by companies such as Convio, Kintera, Groupstone, GetActive Software, Virtual Sprockets, Social Ecology and others.&nbsp; These services are transforming the infrastructure of nonprofits by integrating a wide variety of knowledge and information management processes such as Web site content updates, membership tracking, email messaging, events registration, credit card processing, e-commerce transactions, and advocacy campaigns.&nbsp; These integrated services, while often out of the price range of smaller nonprofits, nevertheless represent important advances in membership management and online fundraising.&nbsp; This trend has grown because larger nonprofits want to integrate both membership management and Internet presence, and it has come to encompass a number of different organizational functions and staff.&nbsp; Larger nonprofits are convinced that these best-of-breed services deliver improved organizational effectiveness and better member relationships.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.childrennow.org/" target=_blank>Children Now</A> in Oakland, California is an example of a larger nonprofit doing this.&nbsp; Their mission is to improve the lives of children, and they accomplish this through groundbreaking research, media and advocacy campaigns.&nbsp; Recent projects have included studies of media and gender.&nbsp; "Boys to Men: Media Messages<A name=_Hlt18730886> </A>about Masculinity" is their landmark 1999 study that shows how media often reinforces a gender strait jacket and how boys need a fuller range of options to grow up healthy in America.&nbsp; "We were on the lookout for a company that was both flexible and willing to grow with our needs in mind," comments Children Now Internet Coordinator Colette Washington, who signed up with <A href="http://www.getactive.com/" target=_blank>GetActive Software</A> <A name=_Hlt23055529></A>to power their email messaging and advocacy campaigns needs.&nbsp; "Our staff had a wide variety of needs, because we do so many different things, and we quickly found that we would need to prioritize our wish list."&nbsp; They use GetActive Software to periodically contact registered users by email to recommend that certain actions be taken via fax, email, phone, or letters.&nbsp; GetActive powers the advocacy tool, complete with Congressional directory, tracks user activity to help customize action alerts and allows Children Now to contact registered users to provide updates on actions taken.&nbsp; "We have yet to convert all our membership management to this system, but this was an appropriate and affordable first step," says Washington.</P>
<H3>Trend Three: Experimentation and creativity have become hallmarks in online fundraising campaigns.</H3>
<P>Both of the above-noted trends relate to infrastructure changes within nonprofits.&nbsp; Other than infrastructure, this last year has seen a big leap forward in how nonprofits are experimenting in the way that they're conducting their online fundraising.&nbsp; Creativity in using the tools of the Internet has allowed nonprofits to create audio, visual, photographic and other presentations to engage email subscribers and website visitors.&nbsp; Planned coordination between direct mail and Internet appeals has also allowed for better messaging and membership engagement.&nbsp; Finally, the relatively low cost of experimentation in the online medium allows nonprofits to do a lot of campaign testing, to find out what works and doesn't work, and thereby learn their own lessons on their way to online fundraising success.</P>
<P>"<A href="http://www.mspca.org/news_events/enews/summeroflove.html" target=_blank>Give Pets a Chance</A>" is a groovy online fundraising campaign created by Internet agency <A href="http://www.donordigital.com/" target=_blank>Donordigital.com</A> for the <A href="http://www.mspca.org/" target=_blank>Massachusetts SPCA</A>.&nbsp; Combining the compelling appeal of animals needing homes with 60's flower power copy and graphics, the campaign is designed to help find homes for hard-to-adopt animals and increase giving for their care until they're adopted.&nbsp; Bi-monthly e-mails, a home page pitch, and special campaign and giving pages achieved results by dramatically increasing online giving, injecting some viral fun into the MSPCA's online program, giving pet-loving constituents even more ways to help animals, and finding homes for featured animals.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.gristmagazine.org/" target=_blank>Grist Magazine</A>, an online environmental magazine and project of Earth Day Network, raised more than $65,000 in three weeks with a highly creative and innovative online fundraising campaign. Grist sent several personal, humorous, and compelling appeals to its subscribers (including one from the mother of editor Chip Giller), using a combination of HTML and straight text. Says Chip about the campaign: "We were amazed and gratified by our readers' generosity."</P>
<H3>Trend Four: Online giving portals are playing a growing role in donor education and engagement.</H3>
<P>Building on the experiences of 9-11, several online giving portals have played an increasingly important role in educating and engaging donors in charitable giving and volunteering, with civic responsibility as the underlying message.&nbsp; Networkforgood.org, Volunteermatch.org, JustGive.org, USAFreedomCorps.org, NetAid.org, Idealist.org and many others have worked hard to collaborate to engage Americans to get involved.&nbsp; As a result, they are continuing to build the Internet as a medium that serves a vital role in civic life.&nbsp; That in turn is powering the other three, since it broadens the supply side of Internet giving, volunteering and engagement.</P>
<P>While many would use online fundraising and dollars raised as a benchmark for success, many agree that ongoing relationship building between donors, volunteers and the nonprofits agencies themselves is the desired outcome.&nbsp; Internet technology tools have increased in sophistication this past year, allowing nonprofits to try new things.&nbsp; The experimentation that we hear talked about so much in nonprofit agencies is the sound of organizations changing and adapting to new ways of doing things in an era where high speed Internet access, online banking, Internet shopping, and e-commerce are becoming everyday realities for millions of Americans.</P>
<P>It is now more important than ever for nonprofits of all sizes to improve their online fundraising effectiveness and performance.&nbsp; More broadly, it's important for nonprofits to learn how to build online relationships with donors and volunteers, and to do it gradually, effectively, and affordably.&nbsp; Let's use this occasion to renew our commitment to sharing our lessons learned, writing up our case studies, seeking out training opportunities, and working together to make the most of what the Internet has to offer. </P>

<h3 class="title">Unlocking the Potential of Open-Source</h3>

<P>Community building is fundamentally about local problems being solved at the local level by local stakeholders.</P>
<P>What if we were to apply this philosophy to technology development in nonprofit organizations? Already, NPOs are building technology to support their needs. Organizations like the <A href="http://www.americaconnects.net/research/ctcds.asp" target=_blank>Fast Forward Neighborhood Technology Center</A> have built databases with national resources to help other CTCs improve their internal operations. <A href="http://www.openhand.org/" target=_blank>Project Open Hand</A> <A name=_Hlt23049841></A>in San Francisco has built a custom database to manage their delivery of over 400 meals per day to people living with HIV and AIDS.</P>
<P>Local technology solutions are being created for local technology problems. This is fundamentally different from traditional software development where entrepreneurs build a piece of technology for CTCs or HIV/AIDs meal providers because they expect to realize a profit on the sale of that technology. </P>
<P>Open-source principles and practices allow the principles of community building to be applied to technology development in the nonprofit sector. Three key ideas of open-source relevant to the CTCs are distribution, licensing, and community.</P></DIV>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>"Distribution" refers to the availability of software. Open-source allows easy access to software usually via the web. </DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>"Licensing" refers to who has the legal right to use, modify, and distribute a piece of software. An open-source license allows people to do these things freely.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=Section1>"Community" refers to the ongoing group of stakeholders who support, extend, and improve the software. Open-source software has a number of people continually contributing changes back to others.</DIV></LI></UL>
<DIV class=Section1>
<P>In applying these principles to my two examples, we can see where community building and open-source share many of the same goals and values.</P>
<H2>Distribution</H2>
<P>The Fast Forward CTC database embraces the open-source principle of distribution by making the technology freely accessible from the <A href="http://www.americaconnects.net/research/ctcds.asp" target=_blank>America Connects Consortium</A> (ACC) web site and advertising it widely. The Project Open Hand product, however, is not available for download. In fact, a reader of this article might never have otherwise known it even existed.</P>
<P>An open-source approach mirrors how the ACC distributes the CTC database. The technology is easily downloadable and advertised to people who might be interested in it.</P>
<H2>Licensing </H2>
<P>Project Open Hand chose not to license their software at all. Other HIV/AIDs meal providers have no legal right to use it. If they want similar functionality, they will need to build it themselves at a cost of over $100,000. A commercial software alternative is a virtually impossibility since the potential market is so small.</P>
<P>Fast Forward's database is owned by <A href="http://www.edc.org/" target=_blank>Education Development Center, Inc.</A> Their license reads: "This material may be downloaded, reproduced and distributed only in its complete, original form. The material can not be sold, modified or incorporated into other works or materials without the express, written permission of EDC." If someone wants to add a single field or otherwise modify the database to better meet the needs of local CTCs, they need to obtain written permission from EDC.</P>
<P>Under open-source licensing principles, local stakeholders determine for themselves how best to employ the technology according to their local needs. If the software needs slight modification to be useful, they do not have to seek permission before doing so. If a group wishes to modify the technology significantly and distribute it to an entire sub-group, perhaps PowerUp centers or Ohio CTCs, they can do so.

<H2>Community</H2>
<P>The final open-source principle, community, is both the most beneficial and the most difficult to achieve. "Community," here, refers to the group of people that can innovate and extend a piece of technology. Rather than use a static application, community builds new functionality, fixes problems, and generally makes needed changes. </P>
<P>In both examples, the original "owner" of the technology is the only member of the community. Single-member communities are easy to manage&#8212;it is pretty easy to avoid conflicts with yourself. At the same time, there is value in the diversity that comes from community. Different ideas, different needs, and different resources lead to innovative and effective solutions. This is at the heart of why we value community building. Now we can bring some the same concepts into community technology through open-source and realize some of the same benefits.</P>

<h3 class="title">The Corporation and the Digital Divide</h3>

<P><img src="fall-02_winter-03/cncs300dpi_CVR_HR.jpg" width="252" height="112" align="left">On 
 September 13, near the beginning of the post-Labor Day season, I had the opportunity 
 to stop by the DC offices of the Corporation for National and Community Service, 
 to meet with new Acting Director of AmeriCorps*VISTA Robert Bush and Owen 
 Leimbach, dubbed the Corporation's Minister of Technology without Portfolio.</P>
<P>There were pressing matters at hand, two, to be specific, one for each of my hats. As Director of <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista" target=_blank>the CTC VISTA Project</A>, funded under a three-year grant agreement in 2000, I wanted to know more clearly about steps for continuing the program after August '03. The CTC VISTA Project has been the most popular program in the whole AmeriCorps recruitment system since it went online in February 2001. By almost all program measures, it looks like a smashing success. Lots of things are up in the air, yet we don't think we should be winding down, but winding up, to build further on what we've done.</P>

  </td>
 </tr>
 </table>
 <P>As co-editor of the <I>Community Technology Review</I>, I wanted to inform 
 our readership about the fate of all the technology and digital divide efforts 
 currently supported by "the Corporation." All of them are 
 on the horns of a similar dilemma. On the one hand, the George W. Bush Administration 
 has made a number of pronouncements about a diminishing digital divide and 
 targeted for elimination two model programs, the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top" target=_blank>Technology 
 Opportunities Program (TOP)</A> in the Department of Commerce and the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OVAE/AdultEd/CTC" target=_blank>CTC 
 Program</A> in the Department of Education. As far as the Corporation 
 is concerned, the key initiatives and watch words these days are "entrepreneurship," 
 "faith-based"-initiatives, and especially "Homeland Security."</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Administration has not so much said that the digital divide problem no longer exists as it has said it will fight the problem through programs other than TOP and CTC. The President's proposal for reauthorizing and funding the Corporation calls for a 50% increase in the number of AmeriCorps members to support, raising that alone from 50,000 to 75,000, and the <a href="http://www.nationalservice.org/whatshot/summaryHR4854.html" target=_blank>Citizens Service Act of 2002</A> (HR4854), summarized on the Corporation's own web site, specifically asks to "authorize grants for the purpose of technology programs in the classroom, in after-school programs, and in neighborhood centers (E-Corps)." The boost the President has given to public and community service in general would seem to allow for encompassing new initiatives <I>and</I> continuing ones, especially those that are having major impact. Other proposals are even more expansive &#150; the <a href="http://www.goserv.ca.gov/news/newsFiles/PRAmeriCorpsExpansion.pdf" target=_blank>McCain-Bayh</A> bill for universal service, "<a href="http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/g_three_sections_with_teasers/legislative_home.htm" target=_blank>The Call to Service Act of 2001 (S1792)</A>," calls for a five-fold increase. All these give some indication that the Corporation is one agency that can continue to be a major player in the Digital Divide arena.</P>

 </table>
 <P>Preceding the visit, a brief Google search on the terms "community," 
 "technology," and "AmeriCorps" yielded 24,800 links 
 (in 16.7 seconds), in curious comparison with a ten-fold increase in links 
 when "AmeriCorps" was replaced by "VISTA," since there 
 are something like ten times fewer VISTAs as AmeriCorps members, a distinction 
 likely to be lost on the average citizen &#150; and even to many of those directly 
 in the field who benefit from and work with these Corporation programs. 
 In any case, this is a suggestive indication of the substantial scope of these 
 efforts.</P>
<P>For many years the Corporation has been supporting digital divide and technology assistance to nonprofits projects on an ad hoc basis. (<I>The Community Technology Review</I> has covered some of these efforts since 1994, including an overview of "A VISTA's Guide for Mobilizing Internet Resources" in 1996 and the cover feature on the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/na6.html" target=_blank>Ohio Community Computing Center Network VISTAs</A> in the spring of '97.) Towards the end of the last decade, this support intensified with series of national programs, partnerships, and RFPs, including major initiatives with HUD Neighborhood Networks, the IBM-United Way multi-city collaboration on Teaming for Technology, the national AOL/AOL-Time Warner-America's Promise collaboration through Power Up, Tech Corps, and NetDay. The <a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind0003&L=vistanet&F=&S=&P=16700" target=_blank>April 2000 Digital Divide RFP</A> under which the CTC VISTA Project is funded was by itself a 12.5 million dollar initiative. Compare that with this year's <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/whatsnew/whatsnew.htm#new_fy2002" target=_blank>$12.4M for TOP</A> and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OVAE/AdultEd/CTC" target=_blank>$15M for CTC</A> for new programs and one gets some appreciation for the extent of the Corporation's commitment in this arena. It's not accidental that AmeriCorps members and VISTAs turn up so often in community technology efforts. They've been a major force in building the movement for much of the last decade.</P>
<P>Thus it was this context that provided the setting for our September 13 meeting in Washington. And, initially, a number of fears and uneasinesses were certainly allayed.No, Robert Bush, who is not a member of the President's family; has risen through the ranks of national and community service, having begun his career almost a decade earlier through a Southern Baptist Convention-supported project &#150; "faith-based service" as he asked it be referred to &#150; emergency work in Kauai and the Hawaiian Islands in the aftermath of the devastation caused by Hurricane Nicki.He came to the Capitol as a policy specialist from Oklahoma, where he had helped initiate the state's higher ed service learning programs. Bush most likely will not be Acting Director for long. In announcing his appointment in July, following the <a href="http://www.mattdunne.com/" target=_blank>resignation of Matt Dunne</A>, Director of AmeriCorps <a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind0207&L=vistanet&P=R883" target=_blank>Rosie Mauk</A> had said, "Robert ...is committed to making a smooth transition during all the ongoing VISTA business and our search process for a new Director." Bush underlined the transitory nature of his current position when he handed me his card which read simply "Policy Specialist," though he noted that his actual title now is "Manager of Policy, Program Development, and Partnerships." Bush played a major role in launching the Entrepreneurship program, and will likely return to this kind of work.</P>
<P>Along with Owen Leimbach, we reviewed some of the reactions to the President's call for the Corporation to take on a major Homeland Security role. Across much of the nation, VISTA and AmeriCorps members and alumni have expressed serious reservations since this year's State of the Union. </P>
<P>Following the posting of "<a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind0201&L=vistanet&F=&S=&P=18098" target=_blank>President Bush's Proposals to Enhance National and Community Service</A>" on January 30, the reaction was immediate. "I wouldn't imagine if we were in Texas, Arizona or California that parents would feel comfortable with their kids doing border patrol or INS-type work, or even volunteering to help with security at airports across the country," <a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind0201&L=vistanet&F=&S=&P=17284" target=_blank>one member</A> had written.</P>
<P>"While I do not question the need for increased Homeland Defense Security, nor do I want to diminish those who choose to serve their country by volunteering in the Freedom Corps, it needs to be understood that what Bush is doing is taking a respected institution like AmeriCorps and changing its focus to fit his fiscal and moral agenda," wrote another (see the <a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/vistanet.html" target=_blank>VISTANet archives</A> for January 30, 2002).</P>
<P>Said yet a third, "I think you've hit the nail on the head on this one, and I think that most of my Vista/Americorps colleagues will be likewise skeptical."</P>
<P>"HERE HERE!!!!!!!!!"</P>
<P>"I agree, I am also quite skeptical of how these things will play out. Kudos... for sharing your words with us so eloquently!"</P>
<P>These concerns are widespread. As the Associate Director of the Center for the Study of Adult Literacy at a major state university wrote on <a href="http://lists.literacytent.org/pipermail/nla/2002/001824.html" target=_blank>the National Literacy Advocacy (NLA) Online Discussion List in October</A>: "Two weeks ago I visited a volunteer literacy program and heard something very scary from the executive director. For the last few years they have been utilizing VISTA workers and recently they received a letter from the VISTA office stating that if they cannot draw a link between the work being done in the literacy program and Homeland Security, the VISTA workers would need to be pulled from the organization."</P>
<P>Asked about these concerns, anxiety, and anger, Robert Bush and Owen Leimbach were more preoccupied by the challenge from the other end of the political spectrum. No matter how much the Administration was making over the Corporation in a new image, it was the conservatives in Congress who were least persuaded to support the Administration's reauthorization proposal. According to an analysis the previous week by David Broder in the <I>Washington Post</I>, "<a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/Stories/02/9/4/15804334.cfm" target=_blank>Service bill may fall victim to Election Day maneuvering</A>," it was reported in astonishment, "... it is so stunning that the Citizen Service Act, which would reform and expand the main volunteer community programs, is being blocked by the House Republican leadership, apparently to spare a minority of hard-core conservatives from having to vote on the measure before Election Day." The analysis was reiterated in the <I>Boston Globe</I> editorial on "<a href="http://www.boston.com/globe/search">Volunteer Opportunity</A>" at the end of the month: "This should be the year, especially because President Bush is supporting it strongly, having made service a centerpiece of his State of the Union address in January and because many Americans have shown an eagerness to contribute since the terrorist attacks a year ago... But narrow, ideological roadblocks are holding up the legislation in both branches... In the House, however, a strong bill that won unanimous committee support is being held off the floor by the Republican leadership because a few opponents don't want to vote before November....Tomorrow the City Year members will pledge 'to lead by example and be a role model to children.' Would that Congress would take the same oath."</P>
<P>In addition to learning about the legislation's current status, I also learned:</P></DIV>
<UL>
 <LI> 
 <DIV class=Section1>It does not look like there will be any new digital divide 
  initiatives for AmeriCorps programs under the current regime at the moment. 
  Neither Robert Bush nor Owen Leimbach knew anything at all about the "E-Corps" 
  provisions of the Citizens Service Act of 2002. The Kennedy staffer 
  who is shepherding the effort in committee later confessed that this is 
  but "an allowable cost" as opposed to a program at this point.</DIV>
 <BR>
 <LI> 
 <DIV class=Section1>Bush iterated that while digital divide initiatives will 
  not have their own priorities, they will be considered under other overarching 
  guidelines including welfare to work, financial assistance development, 
  children and youth, and older adults and that, based on their anti-poverty 
  outcomes, they could well continue under these broad program objectives.<BR>
  <BR>
 </DIV>
 <LI> 
 <DIV class=Section1>As is always the case with continuing initiatives, cost-sharing/sustainability 
  partnerships will make a key difference. Bush pointed to a series of new 
  Teaming for Technology initiatives in another group of cities that would 
  be announced soon, thanks to additional cost-sharing contributions by IBM.</DIV>

 </table>
 <P>In sum, the outlook for the future is not foreclosed but it is not promising. 
 Despite assurances that additional information would be forthcoming, the full 
 extent of recent Corporation support for digital divide initiatives has still 
 not been laid out, not even detailed specifics about the programs receiving 
 funding under the April 2000 $12.5M Digital Divide RFP.No information 
 has been forthcoming about any assessment of these programs.There has 
 been no expressed interest forthcoming about anything involving a Corporation-supported 
 E-Corps.</P>
 <P>There are champions of digital divide and technology support initiatives 
 within the Corporation. In addition to Owen Leimbach, Corporation staff 
 like Thea Kachoris-Flores and John Zelson are long-time contributors to the 
 VISTA electronic discussion lists about technology resources and developments. 
 Carlos Pedraza, Forest Monsen, Susan Hillyard and others at <a href="http://www.etr.org/nsrc" target=_blank>the 
 National Service Resource Center</A> have a wealth 
 of technology resources specifically targeted to Corporation programs, including 
 the <a href="http://lyris.etr.org/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?enter=digitalconnections" target=_blank>digitalconnections</A> 
 discussion list. Chairman of the Corporation Stephen Goldsmith, Mayor of Indianapolis 
 during its exemplary municipal technology development, was the recipient of 
 a <a href="http://www.indygov.org/winner.htm" target=_blank>Global Information 
 Infrastructure Award in 1998</A> and certainly knows 
 the impact these programs are having (in fact, he had some of the student 
 in his <a href="http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/degreeprog/courses.nsf/wzByDirectoryName/StephenGoldsmith" target=_blank>Harvard 
 class last spring</A> assess 
 a number of them).</P>
 <P>Yet none of these staff or officers will be catalyzed nor will we even know 
 the full extent of what may be lost unless more efforts are made to learn 
 what has actually taken place and struggle to build upon their successes and 
 learn from their challenges. The full Corporation for National and Community 
 Service contribution may be one of the best kept secrets in our national efforts 
 to insure individuals in poverty and those organizations striving to serve 
 them have effective access to the basic tools of 21<SUP>st</SUP> century daily 
 life, and it will stay that way and dwindle off unless efforts are made to 
 make it visible and keep it going.</P>

<h3 class="title">Community Technology in the International Arena</h3>

<h3>Global Congress on Community Networking&#151;Montreal Conference</h3>
  <p>The third <a href="http://www.globalcnpartnership.org/" target="_blank">Global 
    Congress on Community Networking</a> <a
name="_Hlt24259903"></a><a name="_Hlt24260868"></a> , held in Montreal, Quebec 
    October 7-12, was well attended by hundreds of international representatives 
    of community technology programs from 37 different countries and agencies 
    along with United Nations officials involved in the upcoming International 
    Telecommunications Union &quot;<a href="http://www.itu.int/wsis/" target="_blank">World 
    Summit on the Information Society</a> <a name="_Hlt24259992"></a> (WSIS)&quot; 
    to be held in Geneva in December 2003. </p>
  <p>With support from different ministries of the <a
href="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/" target="_blank">Quebec provincial government</a> 
    <a
name="_Hlt24260251"></a><a name="_Hlt24260283"></a><a name="_Hlt24260173"></a><a
name="_Hlt24260297"></a><a name="_Hlt24260160"></a> , notably from the <a href="http://www.autoroute.gouv.qc.ca/fai/str_fai.html" target="_blank">Information 
    Highway Fund</a> <a
name="_Hlt24260188"></a> , the Canadian <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/" target="_blank">International 
    Development Research Center</a> <a
name="_Hlt24260333"></a><a name="_Hlt24260353"></a><a name="_Hlt24260318"></a><a
name="_Hlt24260323"></a> (IDRC), and many international donors, this year's event 
    had a distinctively Francophone tone, as last year's meeting in Argentina 
    emphasized Latin and South America, and the preceding Barcelona conference 
    highlighted Spain and the European Union.&nbsp; Funding for this year's event 
    partially supported development of a new online knowledge base for this growing 
    international affiliation of independent groups and organizations, <a
href="http://www.globalcn.org/en/accueil.ntd" target="_blank">The Platform for 
    Community Networks</a> <a name="_Hlt24260355"></a><a
name="_Hlt24260557"></a> .&nbsp; The developing multi-lingual knowledge base is 
    the result of a key concern about the challenges of using Internet mailing 
    lists and other traditional online communication means to effectively bridge 
    cross-cultural, time zone, and language differences in order to establish 
    a focused civil society presence in the agenda setting process of the ITU's 
    upcoming World Summit.</p>
  <p>The organization of conference representatives was also a concern.&nbsp; 
    The Global Community Networking Partnership (GCNP) had been initiated in Barcelona, 
    but this year in Montreal the GCNP secretariat decided to dissolve the earlier 
    effort to establish an international organization in favor of developing an 
    informal network model of affiliated working groups more consistent with their 
    view of the GCNP mission.&nbsp; A draft action plan for a transitional period 
    was proposed following <a
href="http://www.globalcn.org/en/article.ntd?id=139&amp;sort=1.20" target="_blank">four 
    face to face meetings</a> <a
name="_Hlt24259644"></a> , expressing general agreement among <a
href="http://www.globalcn.org/en/article.ntd?id=140&amp;sort=1.20" target="_blank">those 
    attending the last</a> <a
name="_Hlt24259864"></a> session.</p>
  <p>All these challenges were recognized during a special plenary featuring Adama 
    Samassekou, the chief representative from WSIS (and the former Minister of 
    Education of the Republic of Mali), and two senior assistants, Alain Clerc 
    and Louise Lassonde.&nbsp; Mr. Sammassekou outlined the three main objectives 
    for WSIS:&nbsp; (1) Create a consensual vision of information society, (2) 
    establish &quot;rules of the road,&quot;and (3) establish a legal framework 
    to protect both the private sphere and the sphere of development.&nbsp; The 
    connection between the upcoming UN Summit and this growing civil society global 
    forums on community networking is important.&nbsp; The panel described to 
    the plenary the difficulty in establishing a legal framework to incorporate 
    a diversity of civil society interests within the planning and agenda work 
    in advance of the Summit, a charge given to them by the General Secretary 
    of the United Nations, Kofi Annan.&nbsp; Mr. Samassekou told the plenary:&nbsp; 
    &quot;I feel a preoccupation and concern about the quality of civil society 
    participation in WSIS.&nbsp; It is part of the UN resolution for WSIS.&nbsp; 
    I guarantee total transparency, as long as I am there.&nbsp; You, advocates 
    of the Information Society, do not let your arms down, but remain optimistic.&quot;</p>
  <h3>CivicNet '02</h3>
  <p>As noted in this issue's editorial introduction, the <i>ComTechReview</i> 
    co-sponsored a two week long international online form this fall.&nbsp; &quot;<a
href="http://www.civicnet02.net/story.shtml" target="_blank">CivicNet '02: Building 
    Local Power With Community Networks</a> <a
name="_Hlt24258743"></a> &quot; was the third in a series of &quot;Virtual CivicNets&quot; 
    that began in the late 1990s.&nbsp; The original took place in 1997 and was 
    the first salon style online conference devoted to issues of civic and community 
    networking.&nbsp; CivicNet '97 was the brainstorm of Lisa Kimball and Richard 
    Civille joined by a multi-organizational production team, cosponsored by Apple 
    Research Labs, with other co-sponsors, participants and exhibitors from HUD, 
    AFCN, the Appalachian Center for Economic Networks, Global Telematics, the&nbsp; 
    Canadian Centre for Management Development, Helsinski University of Technology, 
    Libraries for the Future, the Open Space Institute, and the Smithsonian Institute 
    among others and publicized through the Public Policy Network, the People, 
    Computers and Design discussion list, Red Rock Eaters News Service, Potomac 
    Knowledgeway, the Nonprofit Online News, the Alliance for Community Technology, 
    Net-Lawyers, and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, to name 
    a few. </p>
  <p>In 1998 the second Virtual CivicNet was convened: &quot;CivicNet '98: Renewing 
    Communities with New Stories.&quot; This fall, CivicNet '02 discussions centered 
    on the practice of facilitating and moderating online discussions, the increasingly 
    globalized environment for community technology initiatives, and emerging 
    tools and technologies that have the potential to empower local communities

<h3 class="title">Community Networking in Post-Soviet Russia</h3>

<h3><img src="fall-02_winter-03/sergei2.JPG" width="146" height="250" align="left">Paradoxes 
    of Building of the Information Society in Russia and CIS </h3>
  <p>The disintegration of the USSR still influences the world to a great extent. 
    The formation of a functioning civil society sector is needed to overcome 
    the effects of the ex-soviet (CIS) state economical, social and cultural heritage 
    of totalitarian government.&nbsp; It is crucial to effectively use information 
    and communication technologies (ICTs) for rapid improvement of the quality 
    of life of the ordinary people, of women, youth, the elderly, the disabled, 
    and the indigenous.</p>
  <p>The Internet and related technologies have developed rapidly across Russia 
    in the last 4-5 years. The country is at a crossroads as policymakers contemplate 
    how to regulate this powerful medium. While there are vast commercial, educational, 
    and societal benefits to the Internet, there are legitimate concerns regarding 
    the privacy and security of Russia's government and citizens.&nbsp; Like much 
    of the rest of the world, Russia is struggling with a great number of issues 
    and challenges posed by the Internet as a new medium of communication and 
    commercial development&#151;infrastructure and e-commerce, piracy and copyrights, 
    access to information and freedom of speech, and regulatory control and legislative 
    authority. However, Russia faces many unique technical, legal, and cultural 
    challenges to the successful development of an online society, too.</p>
  <p>While estimates vary, there appear to be between four to eight million regular 
    Internet users (the lower figure seems more realistic because in the country 
    there are only seven to eight million personal computers capable to work with 
    Internet programs and a significant number of them haven't connected to the 
    Net).&nbsp; It is realistic to estimate that about 1.5 to 2% of the Russian 
    population is online (compared, for instance, to 34% in Germany).&nbsp; It 
    is striking that about 38% of all Internet users in Russia live in Moscow.&nbsp; 
    This figure highlights the tremendous digital divide in our society. Also, 
    recent polls indicate that only 12% of Internet users are older than 45.</p>
  <p>The nation's IT sector accounts for little more than one-half of one percent 
    of the nation's economy. In an attempt to develop the IT sector in Russia, 
    the government recently initiated a $2.6 billion &quot;Electronic Russia&quot; 
    program, which focuses on developing the regulatory and legal environment, 
    Internet infrastructure, e-government, and e-education. It is the goal of 
    the program to increase the IT sector's influence to two percent of the economy 
    by 2010.&nbsp; While the program has the potential to boost the nation's economy, 
    provide distance-learning opportunities in remote regions, and develop Russia's 
    democratic government, the complete details of E-Russia's implementation are 
    still being determined.</p>
  <p>A separate but equally crucial issue is the use of ICTs and the Internet 
    for not-for-profit/civil society purposes.&nbsp; Last year, the Centre for 
    Community Networking and Information Policy Studies (CCNS) conducted a <a
href="http://www.communities.org.ru/public.htm" target="_blank">study on the use 
    of ICTs in non-governmental organizations in Saint Petersburg and Leningrad</a> 
    <a
name="_Hlt24010583"></a><a name="_Hlt24009507"></a><a name="_Hlt24009717"></a><a
name="_Hlt24009725"></a><a name="_Hlt24009493"></a> .&nbsp; Unfortunately only 
    seven percent of the NGOs in the region regularly use ICTs in their work, 
    and have email and web sites. In Russia only commercial Internet projects 
    develop because of a lack of effective state programs aimed at creation of 
    Internet centres for disabled people, low-income people and people living 
    in small provincial towns.&nbsp; </p>
  <h3><img src="fall-02_winter-03/COMTECH2.JPG" width="300" height="317" align="right">The 
    Role of Community Networking</h3>
  <p>It is now commonplace to speak about the formation of the so-called &quot;informational 
    society&quot; in the economically developed countries. In December 2003 there 
    will be held a first World Summit of Information Society (WSIS) where a wide 
    spectrum of issues concerning human civilization at this new stage of its 
    development will be discussed.&nbsp; But the critical question must be: Whose 
    Information Society? Will it be the one that suits the elites but excludes 
    the majority? Or will it be one that provides and expands sustainability, 
    human rights, and people's dignity? </p>
  <p>At present, Internet access in Russia is available primarily in major cities 
    (at rates that are affordable to average users). Obviously, to bridge the 
    digital divide between Russia and other nations, the Internet must be used 
    in our country by more than just the elite. While there are many problems 
    in creating an online Russia, they break down into two fundamental challenges: 
    establishing a technical, economic, and legal environment that supports the 
    Internet and creating a cultural environment that embraces this inherently 
    transparent technology. </p>
  <p>Community networks (CNs) and Community Informatics (CI) as projects and methods 
    grew for most part within developed and western societies with related cultural, 
    social, economic and technology assumptions and an existing &quot;civil society&quot; 
    infrastructure of norms, values and institutional frameworks that can support 
    these types of services. In societies which for historical reasons have not 
    developed this civic infrastructure&#151;for example, Russia and other states 
    in transition&#151;the development of community-based ICT services such as 
    community networks is difficult.&nbsp; As we develop our ideas about community 
    networks and community informatics, we have begun to ask:&nbsp; &quot;How 
    can ICTs be used as effective tools for fostering self-organizing models of 
    governance in our region?&quot;</p>
  <p>The rebuilding of Russia involves revitalizing a sense of community economic 
    development and enabling local citizens to participate in local self-government/self-organization. 
    For a fully democratic society to emerge in Russia, local (geo)communities 
    (groups of people living within the same locality and united by common values) 
    need to play a greater role in public life.&nbsp; During the Soviet era, communities 
    were structured to a great extent around work places. In the current transition 
    period with most enterprises, institutes, and state farms being shut down 
    or experiencing dramatic cutbacks, there is a significant social vacuum at 
    the local level.&nbsp; Real community needs to become a basic structure unifying 
    socially active citizens who are endeavoring to achieve development for their 
    territory.&nbsp; Right now, there is a need for local communities to play 
    a greater role in public life and to develop networks across communities to 
    unify socially active citizens who are endeavoring to achieve regional development.</p>
  <p>We are sure that one of the main mechanisms for the development of civil 
    society in post-communist states is the transformation of &quot;neighbors&quot; 
    into &quot;neighborhoods&quot; formed by people of various social groups who 
    are nevertheless ready to work together to solve local problems important 
    for all of them. Under such conditions the work undertaken between and within 
    local communities is extremely important. </p>
  <h3>Lessons Learned in Early CN Experiments</h3>
  <p>During the last four years the author has been working in several international 
    research and development projects in the field of civil society structures 
    development at the local level&nbsp;in Russia (Gardarika, UN Habitat Program, 
    The Democracy Works et al.) and saw some cases of very effective use of ICT 
    for creating a good &quot;social atmosphere&quot; within various geolocal 
    communities, establishing&nbsp;new social links, and developing working partnerships. 
    In our practical work we explored new ways and methods for local citizen participation 
    in the decision-making process at the local level, especially through the 
    use of ICTs. </p>
  <p><br>
    In particular, we used tools such as community web sites and small local access 
    centers.&nbsp; In spite of the relatively small percent of Internet-connected 
    local dwellers&nbsp;(most of those projects were implemented in small distant 
    towns and rural areas), a significant part of local residents were involved 
    in these activities.&nbsp; Interestingly, the so-called Soviet intelligentsia&#151;teachers, 
    doctors, and engineers, well-educated people of middle and older ages who 
    struggle to find their place in the new post-Soviet society&#151;appear to 
    form the potential base for Internet development in our region. </p>
  <p>It is clear that the new information technology environment is not only about 
    hardware&#151;wires, modems, servers, routers, etc.&#151;it is about how communities 
    provide access, computer literacy, and organizational training whilst at the 
    same time being aware of the related community development issues. The nature 
    of the information infrastructure, e.g., the content, structure, and relationships 
    among discrete information resources, providers and users is essential to 
    consider because of the degree that this infrastructure can assist in the 
    creation of a new public sphere, where democratic decision making and community 
    building is enhanced.</p>
  <h3>Approaching CN/CI Research and Development (R&amp;D)</h3>
  <p>In regard to a given R&amp;D problem we consider structures of interaction, 
    stakeholders, and regional agents of development as well as ICT infrastructure 
    and capacity to send and receive reliable and objective information. In this 
    sense, the following scheme describes stages in our work developing ICT projects 
    in Russia:</p>
</div>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Description of the project in a language accessible to 
      citizens, including possible ramifications of the project for the local 
      community;</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1>Definition of the key focal points of communication infrastructure 
      and stakeholders;</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Organization of dialogue, communicative and informational 
      events;</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Strengthening of positive trends in local communities;</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class=Section1> Organization of sustainable relationship between local 
      communities and regional ICT project developers.</div>
  </li>
</ol>
<div class=Section1>
  <p>In other words, communication projects should be viewed only as elements 
    of the communication infrastructure development of local communities as a 
    part of larger social projects.&nbsp; </p>
  <h3>The Importance of CN/CI Practice and Theory</h3>
  <p>The studies we have conducted so far suggest that if information networks 
    are seen only as the installation of computers and telecommunication facilities 
    without any analysis of the larger social meaning of these, these information 
    networks quickly die out or commercialize. That is why it is important to 
    develop these resources together with people who will use them. This is why 
    the practice and theory of community networks and community informatics is 
    important.</p>
  <p>We call it a principle of involvement. We must help all citizens to become 
    producers as well as consumers in the ICT economy. We realize that CN can 
    not be created on the same principles as traditional information channels 
    (mass media). New culture is being created now, new principles of information 
    interaction, where there is no difference between <br>
    &quot;journalists&quot; and &quot;readers.&quot; That is why even in early 
    stages of CN designing, community members should participate in the formation 
    of local contents of CN. This results in a double effect &#151;it both increases 
    effectiveness of CN work and turns citizens into co-authors of their own information. 
    Though at present development of CN in Russia depends on external financial 
    support (foreign charity funds, international programs), we are confident 
    that in the future we will be able to demonstrate the promise of these new 
    tools in the economic and social development of municipalities and regions.&nbsp; 
    Consequently, development of CN will become an item within Russian budgets.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Development of such complex social ideas as community networking should be 
    based on substantial inner resources (training programs and sessions, professional 
    employees, methodology materials, and development models) as well as be politically 
    supported (legislation, federal social budgets, municipal orders) in order 
    to maintain national programs.</p>
  <p>Adaptations of models used in other countries will only be successful in 
    Russia if the environmental factors outlined above are accurately defined 
    and accounted for prior to implementation. It is essential to initially screen 
    external models for the adoption of ICT for community benefit against these 
    considerations and their related procedures, methods, and tools. </p>

<h3 class="title">Penza Association of Refugees and Forced Migrants</h3>

<P><IMG height=180 src="fall-02_winter-03/PENZA3.JPG" width=251 align=left>Development of non-government organizations (NGOs) in Russian provinces is closely connected to development of TCP/IP networks and the Internet.&nbsp; A vivid example of this phenomenon is what happened with the <A href="http://www.penza-online.ru/" target=_blank>Penza "Svetoch" Association of Refugees and Forced Migrants</A>.</P>
<P>After the disintegration of the USSR, entire Russian communities returned from the former republics.&nbsp; The Svetoch Association began work in 1997 as a service organization to help refugees.&nbsp; The largest need for migrants was and remains in legal support relating to establishing citizenship and with crossing of customs houses, gaining official status as a forced migrant, and rebuilding social privileges.</P>
<P>Before we began to use information technologies in this work, our help was ineffective.&nbsp; For example, lawyers working on migration problems in Penza often had to go or call Moscow on the phone for advice about particular cases.&nbsp; It was very difficult to learn about similar situations in other regions, and what was being done in other places to provide legal assistance to help migrants. This situation began to change when we were connected to the Internet at the end of 1997.</P>
<P><IMG height=185 src="fall-02_winter-03/PENZA1.JPG" width=216 align=right>Svetoch became one of the first NGOs in Penza to actively use the Internet in our work.&nbsp; We learned to use email, to search for necessary information, and to create web content for <A href="http://www.migrant.ru/~svetoch" target=_blank>our first web site</A> <A name=_Hlt23998205></A>.&nbsp; Employees completed training at several seminars on NGO use of the Internet and became actively engaged in self-education. We quickly understood that for a provincial NGO, the Internet and email are the eyes and ears of the organization. We began to share our activities with colleagues from other regions, information about our work began to emerge on the Internet, and our organization has been included in numerous non-commercial mailing lists.&nbsp; In 1998 our work was recognized by the <A href="http://www.memo.ru/eng/" target=_blank>Memorial Human Rights Center</A> <A name=_Hlt23998280></A>, and we were offered participation in the all-Russian Migration Rights Network.</P>
<P>At that time we chose to develop a legal case database using Lotus Notes technology, at that time a common platform for distributed group work. The development work both with Lotus and the Microsoft programs was challenging. The first network sessions used dial up phone lines to Moscow to replicate the Lotus databases between locations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sessions were very long and the phone connection often broke down.&nbsp; Within a year, we made the transition so that our network operated across the Internet rather than through long distance telephone calls.</P>
<P>Data on all cases for the database was assembled and pleaded by the lawyers across the network.&nbsp; The cases are described in detail with the writ and decisions of courts. Second in importance to this database is the "Log of reception and reports." Here data is assembled about migration issues and situations from various regions, as learned over the network.</P>
<P>By early 1999 the network consisted of ten agencies. First were organizations from Moscow, Penza, Voronezh, Saratov, Perm, and Krasnodar. The first stage of the network was financed by the <A href="http://www.eurasia.msk.ru/english/news/3quarter2000.html" target=_blank>Ford Foundation</A> <A name=_Hlt23999211></A>and <A href="http://www.unhcr.ch/" target=_blank>United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR)</A> <A name=_Hlt23999349></A>, and brought together organizations dealing with economic problems.&nbsp; Eventually our association had a well-equipped computer class in which it was possible to simulate various working situations occurring in the Lotus Notes environment.&nbsp; By 2001 the service totaled about 40 agencies, two servers, and <A href="http://refugee.memo.ru/" target=_blank>an active site</A> <A name=_Hlt23999459></A>. Presently the network has 47 agencies with ten located where people especially require protection&#151;Dagestan, Ingushetiya, Stavropol, and Krasnodar Territory as well as in Chechnya.&nbsp; Over the last year the agencies in this network have compiled some ten thousand records and pleaded about one thousand cases.&nbsp; The number of databases with which the lawyers of a network work has increased now to six.</P>
<P>Because Penza's NGOs can communicate with the colleagues from other regions, exchange experience, and locate partners, we have created and support a database on noncommercial organizations for the entire region <A name=_Hlt23999669></A>.&nbsp; We now advise NGOs and teach classes on information technologies including computer engineering, application development, and distribution of information in the mass media.&nbsp; We serve as a resource center for NGO representatives who do not have computers or email and have helped many of our colleagues in the region get computers and connected to the Internet. Today, from 150 of the most active of Penza's NGOs, fifteen now have email, in a city of 500,000 where perhaps 3,000 have direct Internet access.</P>

<h3 class="title">Municipal and Civic Internet Use in Togliatti</h3>

<p>There are three stages in the emergence and development of municipal and 
    civic Internet use in <a
href="http://www.bisnis.doc.gov/bisnis/bulletin/9801reg.htm" target="_blank">Togliatti</a>, 
    located 1,000 kilometers southeast of Moscow on the Volga River.</p>
  <h3>Stage One</h3>
  <p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/tolliatti2.JPG" width="214" height="239" align="left">The 
    first stage began in 1993, when an elective campaign for the State Duma and 
    the Constitutional referendum for the Russian Federation was held.&nbsp; The 
    first web site was created to link the districts with the City Administration 
    at that time.&nbsp; Following the increasing number and use of PCs in the 
    offices of the District and City Administrations, channels linking the City 
    Duma, the Center of Pensions' Payment, and the Togliatti Administration of 
    Internal Affairs were made in 1996.&nbsp; In that period the <a href="http://iatp-old.projectharmony.ru/english/news/3_08_00.html" target="_blank">Development 
    through Education Fund</a> <a
name="_Hlt24002506"></a><a name="_Hlt24004174"></a><a name="_Hlt24007506"></a> 
    received a number of computers from the Boston-based <a
href="http://www.advancedrecovery.com/environmentalissues/html/village_voice_article.html" target="_blank">East-West 
    Foundation</a> <a
name="_Hlt24001154"></a> for 20 of the city's schools.</p>
  <p>In 1996-1998, a service was developed to provide for municipal educational 
    institutions' needs. A grant from the <a href="http://www.eurasia.org/" target="_blank">Eurasia 
    Foundation</a> made it possible to buy five SPARCStations 4 and organize the 
    first servers (WWW, e-mail, ftp, etc.) for the educational sphere. The firm 
    &quot;Is-Tel&quot; was the Internet service provider and made important contributions.</p>
  <p>Among the active initiators of Internet access in Togliatti were municipal, 
    copmany, foundation, and education participants: Y.A. Polozov, head of the 
    informational equipment sources of the department of Mayor; A.N. Orlov, head 
    of Is-Tel; Madelyn Rose Hopkins, volunteer at the Development through Education 
    Fund; E.O. Pinskaya, head of the Mediacenter; A.G. Rodionov, the deputy director 
    of the Education department of Administration; N.I. Kulyasova, the head of 
    the District Management of Education department; and M.Y. Nadtochiy, senior 
    lecturer of Togliatti Polytechnical University.</p>
  <h3>Stage Two</h3>
  <p>The second stage of the development of Internet in Togliatti took place from 
    1997 till 1999.&nbsp; In that period the Development through Education Fund 
    obtained a second grant from the <a
href="http://www.eurasia.org/" target="_blank">Eurasia Foundation</a> <a
name="_Hlt24004007"></a> for training educational system administrators.&nbsp; 
    A new program called &quot;Informatization of education in Togliatti&quot; 
    was developed and implemented with the help of the city's authorities.</p>
  <p>The department of Mayor and the &quot;Open Society University&quot;/Soros 
    Foundation signed an agreement for the &quot;creation and development of the 
    informational space for nonprofit organizations in spheres of education, culture 
    and public health.&quot; The Development through Education Fund, Samara State 
    University, Togliatti Branch of Samara State Pedagogical University and the 
    City's Policlinic # 2 took an active part in the project.</p>
  <p>Through this program participants bought computers, linked their local webs 
    to the city's, and established classes for free access to Internet. In 1998 
    a major &quot;<a
href="http://www.internetelite.ru/samarari/english/area.phtml?area=areas3&amp;pic=07" target="_blank">Civics 
    Education</a> &quot; project involving fifteen city schools undertaking web 
    site development on this theme began with a grant from the <a href="http://www.ned.org/" target="_blank">National 
    Endowment for Democracy</a>.</p>
  <p>Key contributions included Mayor S.F. Zhilkin; the head of one of the departments 
    of Mayor, L.V. Zalamanova; the head of the Education department, L.N. Bednova; 
    head of ITC, A.M. Pinskiy; T.I. Lesnyakova, a teacher of computer science 
    of the gymnasium # 6; and A.L. Sannikov, the head of the Informational Center 
    at Samara State University.</p>
  <h3>Stage Three</h3>
  <p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/tolliatti1.JPG" width="216" height="194" align="left">The 
    third stage began in 2000 with the acquisition and installation of equipment 
    bought through funding from the &quot;Open Society University&quot;/Soros 
    Foundation grant.&nbsp; Activities included establishment of a center for 
    municipal computer services management.&nbsp; Five free Internet access centers 
    were opened, and all schools were supplied with Internet access with help 
    from commercial Internet service providers such Infopac, High Technologies' 
    Attack, and AIS.T.</p>
  <p>Another grant, from the American nonprofit <a href="http://www.projectharmony.org/" target="_blank">Project 
    Harmony Inc</a>., helped open two access centers, one at the Development through 
    Education Fund, the other at the central city's Tatischev Library.&nbsp; Regular 
    seminars and training courses for teachers in usage of Internet technologies 
    in professional activities also began, held at the tutorial offices of the 
    Development through Education Fund, Mediacenter, and the Center of Information 
    Technologies.</p>
  <p>For supplying and development of the city's educative resources, an association

<h3 class="title">Pattern Introduction: Uncovering and Understanding Our Common Language</h3>

<p><img src="fall-02_winter-03/doug-snow.jpg" width="121" height="175" align="left">There's 
    an old fable about three bricklayers who were asked what they were doing. 
    The first replied that he was laying bricks. The second reported that he was 
    constructing a straight wall. The third, a somewhat dreamy type, stated that 
    he was building a cathedral.</p>
  <p>Readers of the <i>Community Technology Review</i> know they are involved 
    in construction projects as well. Although our bricks are less physical and 
    our walls less visible, we hope we are building cathedrals nevertheless, though 
    ours are built upon conversations and relationships. Our &quot;blue prints&quot;are 
    hazy and ill-defined. Our fellow builders may not be aware of each other and 
    the immense intelligence and vitality that they show in their thoughts and 
    actions. For this reason, in November 2001, <a href="http://www.cpsr.org/" target="_blank">Computer 
    Professionals for Society Responsibility (CPSR)</a> initiated a large, participatory 
    <a href="http://www.cpsr.org/conferences/diac02/" target="_blank">&quot;pattern 
    language&quot; project</a> that we hope will elicit, integrate, and illuminate 
    some of the knowledge that inspires our community&#151;in a very broad sense. 
  </p>
  <p>The idea of a pattern language is a concept developed by Christopher Alexander 
    and his colleagues at the University of California at Berkeley and is presented 
    in <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195019199/palestinebook-20/103-8436682-7150259" target="_blank">A 
    Pattern Language</a></i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195019199/palestinebook-20/103-8436682-7150259"> 
    (Oxford University Press, 1977)</a>. This book provides 253 <i>patterns</i> 
    for the construction of towns and houses that are beautiful, convivial, and 
    timeless. According to Alexander et al., a pattern is a &quot;careful description 
    of a perennial solution to a recurring problem.&quot; A pattern <i>language</i> 
    is a &quot;network of patterns that call upon one another. Patterns help us 
    remember insights and knowledge about design and can be used in combination 
    to create solutions.&quot; Part of the power of the approach which we're emulating 
    in our project comes from the common format that each pattern follows: title, 
    problem, discussion, and solution. Each pattern also contains illustrative 
    graphics at the beginning and end as well as pointers to other especially 
    relevant patterns in the language. We are hoping to do the same in the area 
    of information and communication as Alexander and his colleagues did for architecture 
    and building. </p>

<h3 class="title">Pattern Discussion: Collaborative Design of Community Information Systems</h3>

<h2><img src="fall-02_winter-03/troy.jpeg" width="180" height="145" align="left">Problem</h2>
  <p>Many cities in the United States, especially in the Northeast, are stagnant 
    and decaying, with consequences both economic and social. Populations, especially 
    minority populations with low levels of income and education, have limited 
    access to new computer technologies and thus limited access to information 
    about education and employment opportunities and social and recreational activities. 
    These populations are mirror images of the digital divide.</p>
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>The <a href="http://troynet.net/" target="_blank">Troy Community Networking 
    Project</a> <a name="_Hlt24013981"></a> is developing a youth-services information 
    system in an effort to improve the quality of life for young people in one 
    of these communities, Troy, New York. This system, called <a href="http://troynet.net/connectedkids/" target="_blank">Connected 
    Kids</a> <a
name="_Hlt24013957"></a> , will provide information about recreational, educational, 
    and cultural resources plus multimedia content developed by and for young 
    people. System developers are using participatory-design (PD) processes to 
    conceive and build this complex technical/social system. The project embraces 
    a diversity of participants within a complex &quot;activity system&quot; representing 
    city, county, public and private schools, and youth-services organizations. 
    We brought these participants together in a series of PD sessions to test 
    our understanding of the system specifications as realized in our initial 
    prototype. The PD sessions renewed and revised our understanding of our shared 
    purpose, expanded our understanding of our audiences and users, and identified 
    system enhancements through hands-on activity and collaborative discussion. 
    The sessions also revealed contradictions or tensions within the activity 
    system and thus invited changes in the prototype and in the activity system 
    itself. Currently we are extending this work to include PD sessions with parents 
    and young people and computer reconstruction and training activities for young 
    people in local after-school programs.</p>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>We believe that bringing together a diversity of participants in hands-on 
    activity and collaborative group discussion directed toward a shared purpose 
    can help communities to build both better technical systems and stronger social 
    communities over the long term. PD processes help people find their own solutions 
    to their problems, their own ways to help themselves, their organizations, 
    their families, and their communities.</p>

<h3 class="title">Pattern Discussion: Mutual-Help Medical Web Sites</h3>

<h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>People confronted with serious health issues urgently need timely, personalized 
    information, and caring support. Unfortunately, it is rare that busy health 
    professionals or a patient's own friends and family can satisfy this strong 
    need for communication. Sometimes a medically oriented web community becomes 
    a powerful source of medical information, support, and even new friendships. 
    How can a site be designed to promote this useful outcome?</p>
  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  <p>
    <!-- fwtable fwsrc="shared_trust.png" fwbase="shared_trust" fwstyle="Dreamweaver" fwdocid = "742308039" fwnested="0" -->
    The key seems to lie in trust, a necessary condition for mutual help to thrive. 
    Therefore, we looked at trust-building strategies in an exemplary online community, 
    <a
href="http://bca.ns.ca/" target="_blank">Breast Cancer Action Nova Scotia</a> 
    <a
name="_Hlt24014177"></a><a name="_Hlt24014193"></a><a name="_Hlt24014196"></a> 
    , the largest and oldest site for breast cancer survivors. </p>
  <p align="center"><img name="shared_trust" src="fall-02_winter-03/shared_trust.gif" width="401" height="212" border="0" align="middle"></p>
  <p>Studies show the process for building trust involves increasing levels of 
    risk-taking: People lower their guard with individuals when they have something 
    (such as breast cancer) in common. Sharing personal information and doing 
    things together are steps toward greater trust and intimacy. </p>
  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>The Canadian site encourages trust through the following design features:</p>
</div>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> Nonprofit sponsorship by breast cancer survivors and 
      vigilant protection from harassment reduce risks to participants. Simultaneously, 
      the ability to &quot;lurk&quot; allows visitors to assess the benefits of 
      participating while remaining invisible.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=Section1> A password-protected &quot;biog&quot; section and a more 
      public &quot;profile&quot; option allow users to disclose as much as they 
      wish about their lives.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class=Section1> The site promotes participation in international gatherings, 
      fundraising, book authorship, and many other shared experiences. </div>
  </li>
</ol>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p>Web sites that are designed with trustworthiness in mind can promote effective 
    mutual help online, providing vital information and comfort to medical patients.</p>

<h3 class="title">Pattern Discussion: Information Ecology</h3>

<p><b>Problem</b>: The dynamic radiative information environment, the flow of 
  information, and the sensory and communicative nature of information, have not 
  been included in most whole-systems ecological thinking and applications, to 
  date. It is a major error in human understanding that will have troubling consequences, 
  as we increasingly interact with and manipulate this fragile ecosystem.</p>
<p><b>Discussion</b>: Ecology is the study of the complex relationships between 
  living and non-living, inter-dependent dynamic systems. It describes the fragile 
  balance in which such systems interact and by which they co-evolve. Information 
  Ecology extends our basic understanding of ecology to include the physical, 
  social and economic transformations being wrought by the rapid developments 
  in information technology, networked learning, and by our becoming an increasingly 
  networked &quot;society of mind&quot;.</p>
<p>Information is not just data or bits. It is not simply a useful natural resource; 
  a commodity that can be sent and received, bought and sold, and regulated. Information 
  must also be considered as patterns of perception, cognitive relationships and 
  differences. The flow of information determines the course of social evolution. 
  Decisions regarding spectrum allocation, regulatory interventions, copyright, 
  privacy, digital divides, technology development or &quot;new economies&quot; 
  cannot be effective, if made without an ecological context.</p>
<p>Today's Information Revolution, if it is primarily a technology driven revolution, 
  will likely result in increased consumerism, social systematization, bureaucracy 
  and waste. The more cumulatively energy consuming and less ecologically sustainable, 
  the more fragile technological progress will become; and ultimately more disruptive 
  in its (inevitable?) potential failure.</p>
<p><b>Solution</b>: There is much to do, to integrate matter, energy and information 
  into a whole systems ecology. Becoming a bit smarter about the way the world 
  works, may also be dangerous, coming into conflict with long dominant, vested-interest 
  belief systems and ideological fictions. Education, thoughtful exchange, research, 
  creative practice and respect for differences are all needed. There is no solution, 
  however. We can only begin to take small &quot;steps towards an ecology of mind&quot;.</p>

<h3 class="title">Pattern Discussion: Mobile ICT Laboratories for Disadvantaged Communities</h3>

<b>Problem</b>: The lack of access to technology and Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) in particular is an acute problem known as the 'Digital Divide'. 
This problem is partly one of both resource and location but is also one in which 
the term 'digital' has two meanings, viz. digital technology (as opposed to analogue); 
and digital in the sense of numbers as they relate to mathematics, technology, 
and the sciences. 
<p><b>Discussion</b>: Digital Divide solutions should focus on promoting: i) Greater 
  awareness and experience of science and technology; ii) awareness, experience 
  and understanding of ICT and its modern role; iii) career possibilities represented 
  by pursuing knowledge and qualifications in science and technology; iv) awareness 
  of the possibilities of participation in the electronic economy.</p>
<p>The two major contributing factor to the digital divide are lack of access 
  to ICT's and the inability to afford them. Access to technology should include 
  more than computers and connections. Many issues affect real access to technology, 
  including community capacity, relevance, socio-cultural factors, local and macro-economic 
  environments, gender issues, and political will. Without real access, people 
  are unable to use and embrace technology to the extent that they can use it 
  to improve their lives.</p>
<p><b>Solution</b>: The provision of travelling ICT laboratories the operators 
  of which are trained educators, could play a strong role in bringing the ICT 
  mountain to the disempowered. Such a self-contained unit with its own power 
  generation ability will allow many people to experience and learn about ICT's 
  whether they are remotely located, or simply living in communities which are 
  too poor to allow access otherwise.</p>

<h3 class="title">Pattern Discussion: Conversational Support across Boundaries</h3>

<p><b>Problem</b>: Although thought goes into how best to break up complex processes 
  into smaller sub-processes, it inevitably happens that unanticipated coordination 
  and communication is required among groups in order to meet the overall goal. 
  However, absent regular communication across boundaries, groups develop an "in-group" 
  vs. "out-group" view thus making cooperative problem solving and action difficult. 
</p>
<p><b>Discussion</b>: Such difficulties from lack of regular communication occur 
  in many settings; e.g., isolated academic departments in a University; service 
  personnel not having a way to communicate common problems back to developers; 
  management and union leadership only talking during tense contract negotiations. 
</p>
<p>Supporting conversation across boundaries did occur at Hanna Pavillion, a psychiatric 
  hospital where I worked. Each shift overlapped a half hour with the next and 
  some personnel from both shifts participated in daily hand-off meetings and 
  used on-going jointly produced nursing notes as well as informal gatherings 
  to foster coordination across shifts. </p>
<p>In June 2001, IBM held WorldJam, a 3-day virtual on-line meeting to which all 
  IBM employees world-wide were invited to participate and discuss common problems 
  thus allowing conversation and interchange across organizational boundaries.</p>
<p><b>Solution</b>: No matter how you organize a complex social structure, provide 
  support (time, place, atmosphere and motivation) for conversations across any 
  boundaries created. Then, when emergencies or breakdowns occur, people will 
  engage in collaborative problem solving rather than finger pointing.</p>

<h3 class="title">Benton Foundation Public Policy Update: Looking to the Future</h3>

<DIV class=Section1>

  <P><img src="fall-02_winter-03/norrisdickard.jpg" width="144" height="108" align="left">The 

    <A href="http://www.benton.org/" target=_blank>Benton Foundation</A>'s third 

    decade begins with a renewed commitment to accelerating digital opportunity 

    for all people, and we are energized under the leadership of our new president, 

    <A href="http://www.benton.org/About/staff.html#taylor" target=_blank>Andrea 

    Taylor</A><A name=_Hlt22983399></A>.</P>

<P>Those who work on the community technology front are well aware that individual, societal, and economic development benefit from the expanded use of information and communications technologies.&nbsp; You know that in the 21st Century world of telecommunications, digital literacy is critical for success. </P>

<P>Looking to the future, the Benton Foundation intends to work with intermediary organizations and policymakers to help underserved communities realize the benefits and promise of digital technology.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2002, we've focused on building bridges across sectors and among decision makers. Despite proposed cutbacks for technology investments, we believe this is not a time to retrench.&nbsp; We've partnered with key organizations to counteract the sentiment of many that the digital divide is somehow nearly bridged.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P>A series of reports and papers on which we've worked have helped frame the national debate.&nbsp; "<A href="http://www.benton.org/policybriefs/brief01.html" target=_blank>Federal Retrenchment on the Digital Divide: Potential National Impact" </A><A name=_Hlt22983836></A><A name=_Hlt22983857></A>was released early in 2002 as the first policy brief in a series exploring the national impact of possible federal retrenchment on digital divide policies. "<A href="http://www.aecf.org/publications/data/snapshot_june2002.pdf" target=_blank>Connecting Kids to Technology: Challenges and Opportunities</A>," co-authored by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Benton, is the latest Snapshot report from the <A href="http://www.aecf.org/kidscount" target=_blank>KIDS COUNT</A> series.&nbsp; It examines the demographics of the digital divide and discusses current telecommunications trends and their relevance for children.&nbsp; In summer 2002, a luncheon policy forum in the Hart Senate Office Building was held for national policymakers to discuss the important findings in this report. "<A href="http://www.digitaldividenetwork.org/content/stories/index.cfm?key=248" target=_blank>Bringing a Nation Online: The Importance of Federal Leadership</A>," a report by Benton and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund, explains why community technology investments from the federal level are still critical.&nbsp; It has been used extensively by the <A href="http://www.digitalempowerment.org/" target=_blank>www.digitalempowerment.org</A> <A name=_Hlt22984330></A>campaign.</P>

<P>While Benton has focused on the domestic policy scene, we have also sought to expand our global impact.&nbsp; On World Telecommunications Day, Benton and <A href="http://www.oneworld.net/" target=_blank>OneWorld</A>, the online sustainable development and human rights network, announced the launch of the <A href="http://www.digitalopportunity.org/" target=_blank>Digital Opportunity Channel</A>, an online community focusing on the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) for sustainable development.&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 2002, Benton is co-hosting the second <A href="http://www.digitale-chancen.de/content/sections/static.cfm?key=18" target=_blank>Trans-Atlantic Teens and Technology Roundtable</A>.&nbsp; A group of funders, researchers, and policymakers from Europe and the United States is gathering in Switzerland to continue a dialogue on ways to best reach underserved youth.</P>

<P>Of course, we will continue our work on the <A href="http://www.digitaldividenetwork.org/" target=_blank>Digital Divide Network</A>, which we intend to improve through a revamping of the website, new content partnerships, and improved reporting on federal, state, and local public policies.</P>

<P>Finally, as the Benton Foundation learns more about the impact of technology on society, we'll seek to more actively educate and engage policymakers and stakeholders about how to promote 21st Century literacy for all&#8212;a central priority in the years ahead.</P>

    Review. Please excuse any literary shortcomings. As a veteran CN leader, my 

    writing experience has been mostly creative fiction and fantasy, notably grant 

    applications and project budgets.</p>

  <p>Since the early Nineties, I have been President, then Executive Director 

    of a community network, the <a href="http://www.MAIN.org/" target="_blank">Metropolitan 

    Austin Interactive Network</a>. We began as a text and gopher-based online 

    information network, later installing Austin's first free public library Internet 

    access (in 1995, if I recall correctly).</p>

  <p>With the birth of Austin FreeNet, our friends and unofficial "sister", 

    and their wonderful public access programs, MAIN re-focused on web information 

    and support for non-profits within Austin and launched the <a href="http://www.TCRC.net/" target="_blank">TeleCommunity 

    Resource Center</a> network to install free public access terminals in 25 

    cities outside Austin (1996). In years since, TCRC has worked to become a 

    support resource for community technology network leaders everywhere.</p>

  <p>One of our most rewarding TCRC projects is "<a

href="http://www.tcrc.net/roadshow" target="_blank">The Internet Roadshow</a>," 

    a community technology outreach program. The Roadshow goes from town to town, 

    by invitation, to explain and promote local telecom bandwidth and community 

    technology networks. </p>

  <p>Another enjoyable TCRC project is the national Community Network Conference, 

    co-hosted by AFCN. This year's fifth annual conference, "<a href="http://www.tcrc.net/conference" target="_blank">CN2002</a>," 

    will be held December 8-10 at the Hyatt Regency in Austin, Texas. (FYI: We 

    currently plan to offer discount registrations for AFCN and CTCNet members.)</p>

  <h3><b>AFCN and The Year Ahead</b></h3>

  <p>As you may have heard, Dr. Andrew Cohill has left Blacksburg Electronic Village 

    and the university to become a full-time CN consultant. Well, I'm happy to 

    report Andrew has agreed to remain as active in the AFCN administration as 

    he possibly can. </p>

  <p>This is one more good sign for AFCN and community networking in general: 

    the group's creators laid a solid foundation for our future. Since then, AFCN 

    has steadily grown and is now a strong organization, blessed with more members 

    and supporters than ever. Operations, accounting, communication, and 

    other basics are running smoothly, thanks to smart, hardworking volunteers.</p>

  <p>And a key mission remains unchanged: to provide support for CN leaders everywhere. 

    Our challenge, with finite resources for the coming year, is where to sharpen 

    focus and possible new directions, therefore I propose our next step of growth 

    include broadening our leadership, our membership, and our services. 

  </p>

  <p>As a CN leader this challenge should sound familiar to you, because AFCN 

    is itself a CN, as is CTCNet. Both organizations link a virtual, non-geographic 

    community of people who use technology as a tool for social and economic benefits. 

    Seems only reasonable we should aspire to become our own best CN model.</p>

  <p>So how about it? Are you willing to speak up and step in as a volunteer leader 

    for the coming year? You can help AFCN decide the best ways to help our communities 

    and define the roles and committees (or working groups or whatever) required 

    to deliver those services. This help doesn't have to be a burden; even a little 

    time given can make a big difference.</p>

  <p>Let's review some notions and needs, and then ask your insights and suggestions 

    on the AFCN year's agenda. (And let us know if you are willing to work with 

    any of these initiatives.)</p>

  <h3><b>Wider Perspective &#150; CN and Local Bandwidth </b></h3>

  <p>Our team spends a lot of time on the road with the Internet Roadshow and 

    with our community technology consulting services. (We've done CN planning 

    for more than fifty towns and cities.) In these travels, mostly to rural and 

    underserved urban areas, we're hearing a clear message that the rural mood 

    is changing.</p>

  <p>Getting adequate local access is no longer viewed as merely a social "do-gooder" 

    concern. With businesses closing and families leaving, community leaders now 

    recognize telecom as part of a life-or-death economic priority. Similarly, 

    people in underserved urban neighborhoods are increasingly aware that telecom 

    inequity is another barrier facing their families and their futures. </p>

  <p>These leaders tell us, "Telecom is not a novelty anymore; it can no 

    longer be a luxury. Internet use has become a fundamental tool 

    for community survival. We need it...but we don't have it." </p>

  <p>In the US, despite "guarantees" like <a

href="http://www./" target="_blank">Section 254 of the 96 Telecom Act,</a> too 

    many people and places are still denied the full opportunities of our celebrated 

    Information Age. Rural areas, for example, are losing residents who would 

    stay if they had connectivity for jobs, for education and all the rest. Unfortunately, 

    the deregulated broadband marketplace is simply ignoring them. </p>

  <p>Let's hope AFCN can help improve this situation, working to expand access, 

    training, and opportunities to use technology to enrich lives. </p>

  <h4>Information Resource for Policy Makers </h4>

  <p>Though AFCN, as a 501c3 nonprofit group, will never go into politics, we 

    can inform decision makers about possibilities and realities of technology 

    networks for community development. This assistance can help them make the 

    best choices for government policy and programs (TOP and CTC, for example). 

    Most legislators and regulators appreciate knowledgeable input from a credible 

    source like the members of AFCN.</p>

  <h4>Communication among CN Professionals </h4>

  <p>Inclusion and communication are valuable not only within community networks, 

    but also among community networks. Each member can help AFCN continue to improve 

    cooperation and sharing among CN leaders. If members wish, we could even explore 

    practical collaborations such as "group pricing" and vendor discounts 

    for all AFCN member CNs.</p>

  <h4>Management Support for CN Leaders </h4>

  <p>Prompted by concerns about sustainability of state-funded CNs, TCRC and Texas 

    government agencies are developing tools and training to support CN operations. 

    These programs, beginning in early 2003, will be available to all CNs, wherever 

    located.</p>

  <h4>Community Network Guide </h4>

  <p>This project is active but remains challenged by constant change in CN overall, 

    and by the limited time of potential authors. We'll review and report on this 

    effort.</p>

  <h4>Outreach, Membership and Partnerships </h4>

  <p>AFCN needs each community technology professional to join and enlist other 

    organizations and professionals. AFCN membership is a powerful tool for CN 

    leaders everywhere, and a genuine bargain besides. Please help us grow.</p>

  <p>On that subject &#150; We're actively working to recruit members outside the 

    US as well. So if you know someone who might be interested, do them a good 

    turn and recommend AFCN.</p>

  <h4>Map of CNs </h4>

  <p>Is anyone interested in improving online mapping of CNs worldwide? While 

    this could never be an absolutely perfect map, if kept current it will offer 

    a valuable resource. (Hey, educators, wouldn't this be a great dissertation 

    topic?)</p>

  <h4>General CN Support </h4>

  <p>There is little sense in each CN developing similar tools from scratch. AFCN, 

    working with TCRC and other groups, could identify resources or create them 

    as needed. Examples could be collections of Acceptable Use Policies, legal 

    and privacy protection updates, and anything else you feel could help you.</p>

  <h4>Wider Leadership </h4>

  <p>AFCN, like the CNs we serve, grows stronger every time we gain another person 

    willing to help the organization. Thus we ask about committees and working 

    groups: Which committees should we have? Which will you join and support?</p>

  <h4>And don't forget...</h4>
