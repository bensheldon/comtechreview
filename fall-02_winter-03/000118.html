<div class="category_title">CTCs for Positive Youth Development: Findings from PowerUP's First Phase Evaluation</div> <span class="posted">by Lisa Schneider and William Vesneski</span>




<p><div class="sidebar_right">Ed. Note: The following article was written before the 
        announcement to PowerUP members in early October that the national office 
        would be closing and the more public announcement, led by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/technology/30POWE.html?tntemail">John 
        Schwartz's New York Times story on October 30</a>. It reviews some of 
        the key contributions of PowerUP centers that can continue to influence 
        CTC development.&nbsp; Since the announcement, more than 500 PowerUP affiliates 
        have joined CTCNet.</div></p>
  <span class="subhead">Community Technology and Positive Youth Development</span>
  <p><a href="http://www.powerup.org/" target="_blank">PowerUP</a> is a national 
    digital divide initiative whose mission is to ensure that America's underserved 
    youth acquire the skills, experiences and resources they need to succeed in 
    the digital age.&nbsp; Since the organization was launched in November of 
    1999, PowerUP has supported hundreds of local community technology centers 
    by providing technology resources and youth development programming in communities 
    across the United States and Puerto Rico.&nbsp; PowerUP creates and supports 
    local centers by donating computer hardware and software, Internet connectivity, 
    technical assistance, and staff training and support. In addition, it has 
    created and disseminated an online youth development curriculum for use by 
    local centers. This curriculum is organized around the Five Promises of <a href="http://www.americaspromise.org/" target="_blank">America's 
    Promise</a>: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Ongoing relationships with caring adults,
  </li>
  <li>Safe places with structured activities during non-school 
      hours,
  </li>
  <li>A healthy start,
  </li>
  <li> Marketable skills through effective education, and
  </li>
  <li>Opportunities to give back through community service.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>An evaluation of the PowerUP program documents the ways in 
  which the resources provided are used and valued by local centers.&nbsp; Our 
  evaluation report also provides a profile of the young people who are utilizing 
  the PowerUP centers and, most importantly, presents an exploratory assessment 
  of how the program is improving the lives of those attending the centers.&nbsp; 
  The evaluation was performed by <a href="http://www.evaluategroup.org/" target="_blank">E-Valuate</a> 
  and completed in January 2002, focusing on the 326 centers established during 
  PowerUP's first phase of operation.&nbsp; Methods include program director surveys 
  and interviews, guided observation of local center activities, and interviews 
  with more than 100 youth participants from around the country.</p>
  <p>Here we present findings relevant to the structure, programming, and goals 
    of local PowerUP centers.&nbsp; We also report on some of the most poignant 
    findings&#151;those concerning participants' experiences in the centers.&nbsp; 
    Please access the <a
href="http://www.evaluategroup.org/Tools_and_Reports/index.htm" target="_blank">full 
    evaluation report</a> for more information on background and methods, and 
    for elaboration of these and other findings.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Local Programming and Goals</span>
  <p>Evaluation findings illustrate the incredible organizational, cultural and 
    physical diversity of program settings within the national PowerUP network.&nbsp; 
    For example, centers are housed in Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, schools, independent 
    nonprofit community centers, and business development agencies.&nbsp; These 
    centers use non-uniform curricula to serve youth who vary tremendously by 
    age, ability, and need, and they operate within a multitude of programming 
    structures with varied capabilities.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Despite these significant differences, the evaluation data point to clear 
    trends in program structure and implementation.&nbsp; Specifically, centers 
    are generally open during after-school hours, on weekday afternoons and evenings, 
    and attended by an average of 195 youth per week.&nbsp; While PowerUP's target 
    age range is 5-18 years, youth of late-elementary and middle school ages are 
    the most prevalent, as over 60% of program participants are between the ages 
    of 8 and 13.&nbsp; Although centers report staffing to be a significant challenge, 
    they maintain an admirable 1 to 13 staff to youth ratio. Most importantly, 
    our findings make it clear that center staff are remarkably dynamic, committed, 
    and effective.</p>
  <p>Despite significant diversity in local priorities and curricula, consistency 
    in central program goals and focus is evident.&nbsp; In general, PowerUP centers 
    share the common youth outcome goals of computer literacy and educational 
    achievement.&nbsp; Centers also tend to structure their programming around 
    the following top five activities: 1) Internet access and web surfing; 2) 
    creative activities such as digital imaging and multimedia projects; 3) educational 
    activities including homework and schoolwork presentations; 4) basic computer 
    training; and 5) word processing.&nbsp; The use of desktop applications is 
    common in the centers, with MS Word, Publisher, PowerPoint, and Mavis Beacon 
    Typing software ranking as the most valued and most often utilized applications.&nbsp; 
    Although structured, staff-guided activities are the norm, the vast majority 
    of programs also devote an average of eight hours per week to &quot;open lab,&quot; 
    when youth can engage in supervised, but unstructured, use of the computers 
    and the Internet.</p>
<span class="subhead">Caring Adults in the Centers</span>
<p>When youth were asked, in interviews and surveys, what they 
  liked the most about the center, they overwhelmingly indicated that PowerUP 
  was a safe place where they had opportunities to forge meaningful connections 
  with caring adults.&nbsp; A full one hundred percent of youth interviewed reported 
  positive, warm relationships with adults in the PowerUP lab.&nbsp; Illustrating 
  this finding are the following typical comments made by youth:</p>
<i>[The staff are] very respectful. [They] help you with questions 
  you don't know. [They] show you a nice smile.</i>
<i>Nice. Help you. They're generous. They want you to feel 
  welcome. Even if I don't know them they are still really nice to me.</i>
<i>Feel safe, like parents. I've known them more than 2 years.</i>
<p>Local staff are also sensitive to their importance in the 
  lives of the young people they work with. During the evaluation team's visits 
  to local sites, staff described the trusting relationships they develop with 
  youth and they provided examples of the ways in which their centers place children 
  at the forefront of operations.&nbsp; The following quotes from center staff 
  capture the positive nature of their relationships with youth participants:</p>
<i>Young people are made to feel that there is always someone 
  that they can turn to when there is a need for help.</i>
<i>Trusting, positive [relationships], and the kids are given 
  the sense of competence, usefulness, belonging, and influence.</i>
<i>Sometimes teens just need to talk. They'll tell me what 
  they've been doing. And I'm like: 'You're doing that?! Do your parents know?' 
  They talk about things they won't talk to their parents about, and you gradually 
  build up that kind of rapport.</i> 
<p>These findings underscore the high caliber and caring approach of PowerUP 
    center staff.&nbsp; Staff members exhibit the type of passionate dedication 
    to youth that has been found to be the most essential element for the success 
    of youth-serving programs.</p>
  <span class="subhead">Safe Places with Structured Activities</span>
<p>Similarly, the evaluation data strongly support a characterization 
  of PowerUP centers as physically and emotionally safe environments offering 
  constructive activities.&nbsp; When local staff were asked what they believed 
  was the most valuable thing their center does for youth, one of the most common 
  responses was &quot;providing a safe and positive place to be.&quot;&nbsp; Staff 
  indicate that they create a physically safe and nurturing environment by:&nbsp; 
  1) offering skilled and caring supervision; 2) maintaining a clean, orderly, 
  and inviting center;&nbsp; 3) setting clear and firm expectations for center 
  behavior;&nbsp; and 4) controlling access to children by way of locks, sign-in 
  sheets, and receptionists.
 Youth concur with staff perceptions of safety, as more than 
  96% of participants reported feeling safe in the computer center.&nbsp; Youth 
  comments indicate that centers provide not only a physically safe space, but 
  also an emotional refuge.&nbsp; The following youth statements illustrate this 
  finding:</p>
<i>The adults make it feel pretty safe. Nothing could harm 
  you here.</i> 
 <i>I feel safe because [the center] has people that would 
  risk their lives for us ...</i></p>   
<p><i>No one picks on you.&nbsp; It's fair, you get a turn.&nbsp; There's no 
    minority, no one's dissin' you.&nbsp; It feels like I am free and could do 
    anything in there.</i></p>

<p>The full evaluation report provides extensive elaboration 
  on the PowerUP program and participants, and it highlights other important findings, 
  especially in relation to marketable skill development.&nbsp; Here we have presented 
  one of the most compelling, overarching messages which emerged from the evaluation 
  study:&nbsp; It is the people, the staff, in these centers that make these programs 
  what they are.&nbsp; In these centers youth are surrounded by adults whom they 
  trust, confide in, and look to for mentorship and coaching. For their part, 
  the adults know how important they are to the young people. One Americorps/VISTA 
  member who directs a PowerUP program in rural Kentucky summed up her role and 
  the promise of her program in this way: &nbsp;
  <p>I am so pleased to be a part of helping bring this opportunity to the children 
    I live near and love.&nbsp; I work as an Americorps VISTA in my home community 
    and I feel this has been the best year of my life. I grew up with people here 
    who, like my own husband, are finally seeing that computer skills are the 
    way out of the coal mines&#151;the low paying dirt jobs which were the stark 
    realities faced by our youth...they are being erased for our children by people 
    and organizations like PowerUP.
