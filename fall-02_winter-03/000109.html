<div class="category_title">ScienceQuest for Youth: A Growing Program</div> <span class="posted">by Jennifer Dorsen</span>




<div class="sidebar_right">
        <p>Our goals for all of our youth are the following: we 
          want each child that enters our center to leave with self-confidence, 
          healthy self-esteem, skills associated with social competency, and understanding 
          of the new technology. We find that our children learn better when they 
          are interested in what they are doing. Our youth will benefit from ScienceQuest 
          as an exciting enrichment opportunity; indeed, we hope it may spark 
          further interest to pursue science and math. Expected as well is the 
          development of skills related to life-long learning: team building and 
          social competency, project planning, study and research, creative and 
          critical thinking, and presentation skills.</p>
        <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>- Andrea Kimmich-Keyser, 
          Greyston Community Learning Center, Yonkers, New York</p></div>
        <h3 class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b>What do you want for the youth in your program?</b> 
  </h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While each kid has unique needs, there are some common 
    goals that many of us share, some of which are summed up in the quote above. 
    Center directors and staff aim to provide a wide variety of things to their 
    young clients, often with too few resources and too many needs.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Through <a href="http://www.edc.org/sciencequest" target="_blank">ScienceQuest</a><a
name="_Hlt23049198"></a>, we have developed a program that supports center staff 
    and volunteers as they reach for these goals with their middle school aged 
    youth (10-14). In the after-school hours, these youth are exploring the insides 
    of volcanoes, communing with lions, and comparing pond water to tap water 
    for health indicators. Others are finding the physics of skateboards, the 
    daytime habits of spiders, or the workings of robots. As part of a small team, 
    each child has the chance to make decisions and to become an information sleuth 
    who presents complex explorations in a well designed website to teach others.&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p>To date, teams all over Boston, in eight surrounding communities, and in 
    thirteen cities nationally have worked on integrating informal science into 
    their technology programs. Over two hundred youth have used their CTCs' tools 
    for learning and presenting information. Eighty-five staff members and volunteers 
    have been trained to guide these project-based explorations, and each receives 
    extensive support during the process. ScienceQuest is funded in part by the 
    <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> 
    and supported by <a href="http://www.edc.org/" target="_blank">Educational 
    Development Center</a> in Newton, MA. Our partners are the community technology 
    centers, business supporters, and science museums. </p>
  <h4><b><img src="/fall-02_winter-03/img/dorsen_discussion.jpg" width="180" height="143" align="right" alt="Three girls">How 
    does ScienceQuest work?</b> </h4>
  <p>The key element to ScienceQuest is the &quot;I Search,&quot; a strategy that 
    many teachers use and that we have adapted to fit the after-school world of 
    CTCs. Through this process, coaches (staff or volunteers, but not science 
    experts) work with a small team of youth through the four stages of investigation. 
    The first stage is &quot;immersion.&quot; As the children explore, they discover 
    for themselves what interests them, what doesn't interest them, and what they 
    want to see next. During the immersion phase, they can try some water xperiments, 
    watch a video on earthquakes, find signs of the coming winter outside the 
    center, or surf the NASA web site.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Then we ask, what did you learn in each of these activities, and what excites 
    you to learn more? Some recent questions have been: </p>
<p><ul>
  <li>Have there ever been volcanoes in Brockton, MA?</li>
  <li>How do robots work and how do they help people with 
        disabilities? (Roxbury, MA)</li>
  <li>What sorts of bugs are helpful in a garden? (Yonkers, 
      NY)</li>
  <li>How do the ants outside the center survive in the heat 
      of Texas? (Lufkin, TX)</li>
  <li>What&#8217;s the nature of the universe? (Chicago, IL)</li>
</ul></p>
  <p>Once a team has a question that they must answer, the rest of the project 
    unfolds over ten to fifteen weeks. They make a plan that identifies resources 
    to help them find information. Some teams go out of the center on field trips, 
    some talk to experts, and some go onto the Internet to find experiments and 
    information to learn more. As they do this, they are gathering and creating 
    content to build their <a
href="http://www2.edc.org/sciencequest/youth/index.htm" target="_blank">web sites</a>.</p>
  <p>In the past two years, we have noticed a few things: the youth involved often 
    become famous around the center for creating their own web site, and the waiting 
    list for ScienceQuest grows. Other times, we notice kids finishing up a project 
    are simultaneously talking about what they will investigate next. One girl 
    on the <a
href="http://library.thinkquest.org/SQ0110120/" target="_blank">Mane Page</a> 
    <a
name="_Hlt23049366"></a> team, investigating lions, talked about her questions 
    about rabbits, since her grandmother keeps rabbits. Bob Hamilton, the coach 
    at Ministry in Action in Lufkin, TX, reported that the kids are asking for 
    more time in the center to finish their project, since twice a week is not 
    enough.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><img src="/fall-02_winter-03/img/dorsen_animaldrawing.jpg" width="450" height="313" alt="My Dog Helps Me" align="center"></b></p>
  <p>The youth can talk eloquently about what they have done and what they have 
    learned, and their confidence shows through. While we do not have the capacity 
    for following the youth through high school and into their post-graduation 
    choices, we do know that youth engaged in quality after-school programs are 
    more likely to graduate and have a positive attitude about learning and school. 
    They show better group skills and make smarter choices about health and activities, 
    according to the National Institute on Out-of-School Time (<a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/WCW/CRW/SAC" target="_blank">NIOST</a>). 
    The youth in our centers live in complex worlds with increasingly complex 
    goals for their future success. Through ScienceQuest, youth explore, learn, 
    have fun and get ever closer to becoming successful adults with a deep understanding 
    of their world.</p>
  <p><img src="/fall-02_winter-03/img/dorsen_marquis3.jpg" width="144" height="114" align="right" alt="Marquis">The 
    <a href="http://www.edc.org/sciencequest" target="_blank">ScienceQuest</a> 
    <a
name="_Hlt23049099"></a> web site has more information about the project, the 
    youth web projects, answers to common questions, and a soon to be launched 
    section of the site for youth. We hope that you will try a ScienceQuest project 
    on your own or apply to attend one of our workshops at the next CTCNet conference!</p>
