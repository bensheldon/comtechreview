<p>The title of this article may sound overly optimistic to some and downright incredible to others. Its main purpose is to help people explore a little-known (and even less-used) technology that may possibly serve as the lynchpin to your organization&rsquo;s communications infrastructure.&nbsp; It's based on my experience doing technology support and development for the CTC VISTA Project.</p>
<p><div class="subhead">The Bad Old Days</div></p>
<p>From the start of my service as an AmeriCorps VISTA in the fall of 2003, I was constantly frustrated by the dearth of efficient communications systems. For starters, Project headquarters depended upon an Excel spreadsheet for VISTA contact information management. Project host organizations provided new email addresses for their new VISTA members, and the deluge of email began:&nbsp; &quot;Hi! I have a new email address at my organization. Please update your records.&quot;</p>
<p>The maintainer of the VISTA roster at the time did take extra steps to convert the list to HTML and upload it (not the spreadsheet!) to the web. But neither the Excel spreadsheet nor the online roster included a VISTA&rsquo;s work or home phone number. Sigh. I couldn&rsquo;t even call another VISTA to complain.</p>
<p>Out of this exasperation <a href="http://cpcs.umb.edu/vista/directory.php">the CTC VISTA directory</a> was born, and what began as a pet project now represents one of my primary responsibilities.</p>

<p><div class="subhead">Delicious, Diabolical Directories</div></p>
<p>Let's look at the tool we used to move project communications into the 21st century&mdash;and some of the capacities it provides.</p>
<p><div class="sidebar_right"><span class="subhead">Find out more about <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/fall-2005/000378.html">LDAP-Movable Type Implementation</a></span></div>
LDAP (<a href="http://developer.netscape.com/tech/directory/">light-weight directory access protocol</a>) is an aptly named Internet standard that does precisely what it says: provide a specialized facility to disseminate contact information. Simply put, an LDAP server on your network houses an organization-wide address book. For years colleges and universities have utilized LDAP (and its arcane predecessor) to create &quot;white pages&quot; for their institutions. While enterprise-level entities most often deploy LDAP on their networks, I want to convince you that even a mid-sized non-profit can reap the benefits of LDAP-enabled services.</p>
<p>LDAP-enabled services? What the heck are they, and why on earth would one want them? Well, LDAP doesn&rsquo;t just supply a nifty address book, one that happens to integrate nicely with email programs&mdash;every record (or entry) in an LDAP directory can optionally have a password associated with it, thereby creating a database of readily available (user)names and passwords. If you happen to work at an organization that requires you to sign in to your computer, check your email, and access the internal network with distinct usernames and passwords, LDAP can replace all three accounts with a single sign-on: your directory entry.</p>
<p><div class="subhead">Back to the Past&hellip;</div></p>
<p>Back to the fall of 2003. Excel spreadsheet Rolodex. Annoying emails. Even more annoyed author. Over the course of that year I developed and refined a friendly, web-based interface to the CTC VISTA directory, designed by Project Director Paul Hansen. By the fall of 2004, a VISTA could log in and edit her own entry, inputting a new home address and home phone number and have an email automatically sent to Paul to update the payroll. Levels of privacy allow us to customize what information's publicly accessible and what's available to whom.&nbsp; Headshots can be added.&nbsp; The directory is searchable and can be organized by any viewer by city, state, first name, last name, any of its categories.&nbsp; Best of all, at the beginning of the year, a change of email address requires the VISTA simply to login and edit her entry: one database to update and one update to the database. Changes to the directory are instantaneous and published immediately. Email address changes are synchronized with project listservs, reducing tedious administration for both regular users and systems managers.</p>
<p><div class="float_right"><img alt="baizman_blog.jpg" src="http://www.comtechreview.org/fall-2005/baizman_blog.jpg" width="250" height="306" border="0" /><div class="caption">CTC VISTA Project Website Blog</div></div>That year we also wanted VISTAs to be able do something different to satisfy their Project documentation requirement. Previously VISTAs had been expected to maintain a website or provide text reports, but the websites produced were updated infrequently, possessed little to no interactivity, and poorly represented the excellent work of the volunteers, though there were some remarkable exceptions. Paul and I wanted VISTAs to be able to focus their time and energy on content and not design or web mechanics. Weblog (blog) software, like <a href="http://movabletype.com">Movable Type</a>, quickly rose to the top of possibilities. Since comments to blogs are emailed to the address in the Movable Type profile, a gateway had to be created to synchronize email addresses with the CTC VISTA directory.&nbsp; With this completed&mdash;along with some additional fixes&mdash;<a href="http://cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blogs.php">the VISTA blogs</a> were established, and our new information and communications system was in place.</p>
<p>As the sidebar of additional technology implemention matters shows, the project took many months and was spread over time, integrated with numerous other projects.&nbsp; With focused attention and additional resources, it can go much more quickly.&nbsp; Lest you think building a communications infrastructure in 21 days is impossible, peruse the <a href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~rcgraves/resnet.mgp">slideshow</a> from the tech department at my alma mater, Brandeis University, for a real-life example.</p>
