<p>Larry didn't know that his work as a VISTA would be so important to him, that he would be able to help so many people, that he would be admired and loved by adult learners, teachers, and other colleagues at the Adult Literacy Resource Institute and in the CTC VISTA project.</p>

<div class="sidebar_left"><span class="subhead">I'm Free</span><br>
<em>By Lawrence P. Syms</em><br><br>
Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free.<br>
I'm following the path god laid, you see.<br>
I took His hand when I heard him call.<br>
I turned my back and left it all.<br>
I could not stay another day,<br>
To laugh, to love, to work, or play.<br>
Tasks left undone must stay that way.<br>
I found that peace at the close of the day.<br>
If my parting has left a void,<br>
Then fill it with remembered joys.<br>
A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss,<br>
Oh yes, these things I too will miss.<br>
Be not burdened with times of sorrow.<br>
I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow.<br>
My life's been full, I savored much.<br>
Good friends, good times, a loved one's touch.<br>
Perhaps my times seemed all too brief.<br>
Don't lengthen it now with undue grief.<br>
Lift up your hearts and peace to thee.<br>
God wanted me now; He set me free.<br>
</div>
Larry had vision.&nbsp; As he was considering VISTA, I told him we could help him out with transportation, either by providing an MBTA subway pass or paying for him to go to San Diego for the CTCNet/VISTA Project national conference.&nbsp; He didn't hesitate.&nbsp; The broad smile and twinkling eye of someone who had for many years been a world traveler told me he had chosen San Diego&mdash;and, I learned later, a brief trip to Mexico. Larry's earlier years of travel abroad, and his friendships with people from other cultures, living in countries where little English was spoken, had strengthened his cultural sensitivity, opened him to new ideas, and helped him appreciate cultural differences. In quiet ways, Larry always showed curiosity, caring, and respect. Ngaio Schiff, a teacher at the Somerville Center for Adult Learning experience (SCALE), wrote that &ldquo;Larry had a gentleness of spirit and a peace about him that put others at ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vision of a larger world, cultural sensitivity, and respect, combined with a fascination with the power of computers and a love of graphic arts and music made him the ideal person to work with immigrants in the Boston area who wanted to learn English and to use computers. He also worked successfully with adults who were returning for basic skills brush-up and job skills preparation classes.&nbsp; In one of these settings, at Project Place, Larry found a young man who was gifted in drawing. Larry showed him how to use a simple computer graphics program, and within a short time this fellow had taught himself the skills to get a job as a graphic artist at a Boston company.&nbsp; Larry was especially pleased about this.</p>
<p>Larry helped new Bostonians at the International Institute of Boston, the Community Learning Center in Cambridge, and at SCALE who spoke little or no English and who had no computer experience, to feel comfortable with technology and to use it as part of their English language learning.</p>

A hidden Buddhist!&quot; Priscilla also wrote &ldquo;there was a lot going on beneath the surface&mdash;he had so much love and creative energy and at the same time was very humble about it all.&nbsp; I think he was very much aware in those last months of just how much love he had and how much he shared ('secretly').&quot;</p>
<p>When I last saw Larry, just days before he died, he proudly pulled out of his refrigerator a fish that he had caught the day before in a covert expedition to Cape Cod. Larry succeeded in living fully and loving others to the very end. In that, and in many other things, he was a model for us all.</p>
