<div class="category_title">Owerri Digital Village — Teaching Young People to Use Technology to Address Concrete Realities</div> <span class="posted">by Njideka Harry</span>




<p>The <a href="http://www.youthfortechnology.org">Youth for Technology Foundation 
(YTF)</a> knows that technology is a means to a sustainable livelihood and that 
rural people become more interested in the application of technology when there 
is clear evidence that it can be used to solve concrete and immediate realities 
in their communities. Since 2000, Y f T, has worked to provide technology access 
and training to many of eastern Nigeria's most disadvantaged youth by providing 
them with technology, leadership and entrepreneurship resources at the Owerri 
Digital Village. Eastern Nigeria ranks as one of the poorest regions in Nigeria 
in terms of communications infrastructure, rural development and technology. In 
the late sixties, this region was traumatized by the Biafran war where over two 
million people, including small children, died of disease and starvation.</p>

The Owerri Digital Village is a paradigm community technology and learning center, 
the first of its kind in West Africa, serving rural people between ages 8 and 
25. Many of these young people come from low-income farming communities, are unemployed, 
and in some cases have low educational achievement. The Owerri Digital Village 
is an extended learning model bridging the technology, gender, education and community 
divides. YTF programs are focused on youth as they are quick learners, community 
catalysts, and have the longest productivity horizon; YTF has designed technology 
programs to improve the economic, educational and social status of program participants. 
<p>YTF partners with other like-minded organizations to develop technology programs 
  that are experiential in nature and designed to increase problem solving, critical 
  thinking and communication skills. In January 2003, YTF developed a partnership 
  with theTexas-based John C. Ford Program, the <a href="http://www.geiproject.org/">Global 
  Education Initiative (GEI)</a> project to implement the Young Scientists and 
  Engineers Tele-Academy at the Owerri Digital Village, a program that utilizes 
  open and distance learning [ODL] methodologies to connect rural Nigerian youth 
  with their digital peers in community technology centers in South Africa, the 
  United States, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The program uses a low-bandwidth web-collaboration 
  platform, <a href="http://learnlinc.cogsask.com/">Learnlinc</a>, to produce 
  live video, voice and data sharing between youth and educators, scientists, 
  engineers and business professionals who serve as mentors to the participants. 
</p>
<p>The Young Scientists and Engineers Tele-Academy addresses two of the eight 
  pandemic issues addressed in the United Nations millennium development goals: 
  reducing the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking 
  water and halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The program equips young 
  people with the technology and communication skills they need to be advocates 
  on these issues. Less family income spent on treating HIV/AIDS and water borne 
  diseases means more money spent on education of the children in the family, 
  for instance. Fewer members of a family being sick will lead to a more productive 
  society that raises the overall standard of living for the community. </p>
<p>Chinyere Mbachu, Program Manager at the Owerri Digital Village, explained, 
  &quot;the most effective method to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS and diseases 
  brought about by unclean water is through community awareness and education. 
  Distance learning programs are particularly effective since they would bring 
  state-of-the-art research to communities that are suffering more from a lack 
  of knowledge rather than a shortage of drugs.&quot; The program uses a blended-learning 
  methodology that incorporates online training with onsite education. Distance 
  learning experts in science and technology team-teach with onsite instructors, 
  thereby increasing knowledge transfer and multicultural understanding of the 
  participants. </p>
<p>During the 12-week program, youth are involved in computer and Internet training, 
  online education, science research and group collaboration exercises. Through 
  a combination of one or more of these activities, youth participants coordinate 
  advocacy and focus group meetings with health professionals, analyze and collate 
  qualitative and quantitative data, conduct online research on the global and 
  economic impact of the diseases, and create research and development plans on 
  the topics of HIV/AIDS and water sanitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to make technology interesting to the users by helping them 
  to use technology to research, document and disseminate information about issues 
  that are important to them,&quot; stated Elochukwu Ukwandu, a program manager 
  at the Owerri Digital Village. The Young Scientists and Engineers Tele-Academy 
  adopts a<br>
  virtual business owner format for training. The youth role-play being board 
  members of a research and development firm hired by the World Health Organization 
  to develop measures to curb the spread of these diseases in developing countries. 
  They elect officers, decide on which students will address various sections 
  of the R&amp;D plan, and use simple technology applications including Microsoft 
  Word, Excel and PowerPoint to document the information. The students present 
  their plans to an international<br>
  panel of judges selected from global businesses and international organizations 
  at the end of the training session. The program helps them to develop research 
  skills and acumen while inculcating the self-confidence, communication, and 
  collaboration skills needed to compete in today's 21st century.</p>
<p>To date, over 120 youth have participated in the Young Scientists and Engineers 
  Tele-Academy at the Owerri Digital Village. This is a new paradigm - it is no 
  longer just about learning how to use technology applications but how information 
  technology can provide a bridge between cultures, groom global citizens, and 
  create new ways of learning and teaching that effectively serve more of the 
  world's children.</p>

<p>It is a courageous feat to take technology to places where such basics as power and water are erratic.  Ms. Harry has taken a bold step to the future and like the Pied Piper, her move is commendable enough to inspire other young educators and entrepreneurs to truly make a difference in the developing world.</p>
