<div class="category_title">FY 2005 Federal Community Technology Appropriations</div> <span class="posted">by Ryan Turner</span>




<p>CTCNet has actively monitored the funding outlook for federal investments in community technology for the year ahead. 2005 will present a mixture of challenges and opportunities for the community technology field. Congress recently passed a spending package that not only included a large number of cuts for important programs, such as the federal Community Technology Centers program, but also the stunning elimination of the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/">Technology Opportunities Program (TOP)</a>. That said, a number of other areas, including the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/21stcclc/index.html">21st Century Learning Centers </a> program and the <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/nnw/nnwindex.cfm">Neighborhood Networks </a> initiative received continued or increased funding. <br>
  <br>
  The overall picture suggests that in light of a daunting economic picture, including the erosion of new federal dollars for programs of interest and continued shortfalls at the state level, community technology interests must focus attention on previously untapped or underutilized programs, including those emphasizing the implementation of effective program models, instead of purely demonstration grant activities. Additionally, resources that encourage collaboration and partnership across disciplines will <br>
  increasingly shape the federal funding picture for the field. </p>
