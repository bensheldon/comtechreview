<p>I've always believed that fairytale princesses reveal much about the societies 
whose collective values they reflect and reinforce. With this in mind, on the 
eve of my departure for a week in Japan, I went in search of the archetypical 
Japanese princess, whom I found in two contrasting realms: 18th century folklore 
and 21st century pop lyrics. In both realms, Princess Peony inhabits a walled garden where she tends flowers 
of exquisite beauty, a loveliness reflected in her person and her retinue of attendants. </p>
<p>As the lyrics of a popular Japanese band confirm, &quot;All girls, In a secret 
  garden, Proceed to become beautiful.&quot;<a href="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></a></p>
<p>But like Rapunzel, Peony cannot be saved from worldly (i.e., male) intrusion 
  forever. One day while strolling near a garden pool, she loses her footing and 
  falls in. Conveniently, a handsome Samurai materializes just long enough to 
  save her from drowning. Smitten by her vanished rescuer, Ms. Peony languishes 
  only to be revived by her troupe of loyal and resourceful peers. With the efficiency 
  of a well-organized sorority, the sisterhood takes charge. They deliver coded 
  messages telling the Samurai of Peony's love, and advise him on how to win her 
  father's approval. Soon everyone is celebrating the royal wedding and the start 
  of an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Not surprisingly, in the iconography 
  of Japanese tattoos, Peony symbolizes wealth and good fortune.</p>
<p>No longer contained by garden walls, Japan's modern princesses, <i>joshikosei</i>, 
  dominate the urban landscape. Fukuoka, the trendy capital of Kyushu Prefecture, 
  proved fertile ground for observing what Sci-Fi maestro William Gibson called 
  Japan's &quot;Mobile Girls.&quot; I saw them everywhere - in underground malls, 
  subways, cafes, schoolyards, and sidewalks, outfitted in sailor blouses, short 
  pleated skirts and baggy socks walking arm in arm, chattering, reading/ sending 
  messages, blushing, flirting, snapping or viewing pictures and thumbing keypads 
  furiously. At the vortex of this multi-tasking was the <i>keitai</i>, or Japanese 
  mobile-phone (which translates as &quot;mobile&quot; with no reference to phone).

<p>Like the intricately decorated fans of fairytale princesses, <i>Keitais</i> 
  are more than mechanical devices. Like the folding fan tucked in the folds of 
  a kimono, the <i>keitai</i> is the ultimate portable accessory, a fashion statement, 
  dramatic prop, social screen, but most powerfully, a medium for covert communication 
  and creating an intimate community. According to Yuichi Kogure, who teaches 
  a class on <i>keitai</i> culture at Tokyo Toita Women's College, &quot;You take 
  your world with you when you have your <i>keitai</i> in your hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Joshikoseis were not the <i>keitai's</i> target market. Originally designed 
  and marketed as business-oriented devices, teenage girls appropriated the technology 
  for their personal communications, and in so doing, co-opted the technological 
  and aesthetic evolution of Japan's most successful digital product. Mobile texting, 
  in particular, was an innovation with origins in pager culture in which girls 
  sent numeric codes to pagers from home phones and payphones. In a study of youth 
  mobile media cultures, Kenichi Fujimoto describes &quot;the girls' pager revolution 
  as a technology-linked paradigm shift, where certain cultural values became 
  embedded in mobile technologies that have now infiltrated the general population.&quot;<a href ="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></a><br>
  <a href="http://www.japanmediareview.com">Japan Media Review</a> reports that 
  70 million Japanese, or 55 percent of the population have signed up for Internet 
  access on their mobile phones, an increase of 300 percent since 2000. In the 
  immediate aftermath of web access, protective Japanese adults registered a collective 
  alarm: <i>Enjokosai</i>, which literally means &quot;compensated dating.&quot; 
  Like courtesans and Geishas of old, the urban legend goes, mobile girls develop 
  sexual liaisons with affluent businessmen to fund their <i>keitai</i> lifestyle. 
  Advertising their availability by punk fashion, these &quot;ko-gals&quot; use 
  their mobile phones to arrange illicit liaisons. While teen prostitution is 
  not unknown in Japan, it is both rare and appears not to be facilitated by mobile 
  phone use. In fact, <i>keitais</i> play an important role in making teens safe.

<p>At a busy hamburger restaurant in Fukuoka, I observed <i>keitai</i> dating, 
  or <i>go-kon</i>, a mysterious ritual whose intricacies had to be explained 
  by my Japanese hostess. Four boys and four girls were facing each other across a table. Talking was confined to whispered messages delivered boy to boy and girl to girl. Under the table (which I couldn't see), everyone was furiously typing on their <i>keitais</i>, showing messages to their neighbors. The closest direct girl/boy contact occurred at the end of the evening, a shy exchange of phone numbers. Other <i>keitai </i>social rituals are documented in &quot;<i><a href="http://www.ojr.org/japan/wireless/1043770157.php">Keitai</a></i><a href="http://www.ojr.org/japan/wireless/1043770157.php"> Log</a>,&quot; a web diary published online by a group of college students researching the role of <i>Keitai</i> in Japanese society. A recent diarist observed that <i>Keitai </i>culture actually strengthens ties between parents and children. 
  She reported that GPS systems are now standard <i>keitai</i> features, and that 
  many high school girls relieve academic stress by text-messaging their mothers 
  during the long school day. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ojr.org/japan/writers/archive.php?personID=333">Mizuko 
  Ito</a> perfectly characterizes the impact of<i> keitai</i> on the urban teen 
  landscape. She writes: &quot;Keitai-wired youth are in persistent but lightweight 
  contact with a small number of intimates, with whom they are expected to be 
  available unless they are sleeping or working. Because of this portable, virtual 
  peer space, the city is no longer a space of urban anonymity.&quot; (<a href="http://www.japanmediareview.com">Japan 
  Media Review</a>, 12/04/04). </p>
<p>As with pagers, the constraints of the <i>keitai</i> keypad have spurred the 
  creation of new modes of communicating. <i>Gyaru-moji</i>, or &quot;girl talk,&quot; 
  mixes Japanese syllables, numbers, cartoon icons and Greek characters into a 
  hieroglyphic script that eludes deciphering by the uninitiated. The fact that 
  it takes twice as long to enter as regular text adds to its popularity as a 
  form of artistic expression and social definition. Recently, young girls are 
  taking advantage of increased bandwidth to handwrite their <i>gyaru-moji</i> 
  messages, which are photographed and sent by email, further showcasing the personality 
  and talent of the sender. </p>
<p>Ironically, the digital revolution of global dimension fueled by Japan's modern 
  princesses is not bringing the wider world to them. Observers of trends in education 
  note the infrequent use of the World Wide Web for formal learning in Japanese 
  schools. The hybrid, scaled down web of Keitai culture provides a canvas for 
  creation, communication and community-reinforcing entertainment - music, videos 
  and even novels are frequently downloaded. Collectively these enrich, intensify 
  and circumscribe an intimate social realm that has been compared to a walled 
  garden, not too different from that graced by Princess Peony and her posse.</p>
<p>It is ironic that Japan's &quot;mobile girls&quot; are not themselves using 
  technology to access a brave new world. But if your walled garden was lively, 
  peaceful, congenial, colorful and subject to the occasional frisson of male 
  intrusion, would you want to leave it? </p>

<p>Fascinating article, Lucy.  Text messaging is also extraordinarily popular among children and youth here in the Philippines -- which describes itself now as the text messaging nation -- and where, among other things, it is said that text messaging led to the fall of a President. There is a text messaging literacy project sponsored by Seameo-Innotech in Manila that may reveal yet another promise of text messaging.<br />
