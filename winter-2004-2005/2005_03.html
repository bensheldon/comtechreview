<h3 class="title">The TechXchange Coalition:  Regional Technology Assistance Coordination in Philadelphia</h3>

In recent years, the Greater Philadelphia region has experienced a tremendous 
increase in the number and quality of nonprofit technology assistance providers 
(NTAPs), coming from community-based organizations that have added technology 
support programs to enhance existing services and new organizations that have 
formed with nonprofit technology assistance as their core mission. In fall of 
2001, representatives from 23 NTAPs convened a meeting to explore how to better 
serve collective and individual constituencies. Out of this came the &quot;<a href="http://www.techxchange.org">TechXchange 
Coalition</a>&quot; — its development is informative and can serve as a model 
for other regions throughout the country. 
<p>With the increase in NTAPs serving the Greater Philadelphia Region, it was 
  clear that a coordinated approach would be very useful to address gaps in services, 
  duplications of services to the same constituencies, and problems arising from 
  competition for limited resources such as funding, sponsorships, volunteers, 
  and more. For example, while many NTAPs were offering software training as a 
  core service, not many NTAPs were providing routine maintenance and support 
  for technology. Many NTAPs were approaching the same funding sources, resulting 
  in an uncoordinated message to funders. </p>
<p>Believing that some type of formalized structure was needed to address this 
  situation, NTAP representatives created the TechXchange Coalition with a mission:</p>
<p><i>To increase the knowledge and awareness of the Greater Philadelphia Region's 
  nonprofit technology assistance providers among each other, our constituencies, 
  and the funding community; to create more efficient and collaborative approaches 
  among providers and funding sources; and to provide a forum for sharing ideas, 
  best practices, and resources.</i></p>
<p>Established to enhance the visibility of the providers to civic, government, 
  and corporate entities, the TechXchange Coalition is not a separate nonprofit 
  organization and is entirely overseen by its NTAP participants.</p>
<p><b>Early Successes</b></p>
<p>Initial efforts involved collaboration on training initiatives, leveraging 
  existing training facilities, instructors, and curricula. This resulted in higher 
  participation rates and expanded reach of training programs without a need to 
  duplicate services or facilities.</p>
<p>Collaboration opened up new funding opportunities, inaccessible to individual 
  projects alone. The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development 
  chose to announce a new technology granting program at a TechXchange Coalition 
  meeting prior to any public announcement, proving the strength and importance 
  of the coalition.</p>
<p>Funders in the region had long wished to better understand the technology detailed 
  in funding proposals they received and to learn more about the role of NTAPs 
  as a resource for their grantees. To address this issue, the TechXchange Coalition 
  approached a consortium of regional funders known as <a href="http://www.dvg.org/">Delaware 
  Valley Grantmakers (DVG)</a> to provide assistance. Because DVG was approached 
  by the Coalition rather than an individual NTAP, they were very receptive to 
  the idea. The Coalition continues to serve as a resource to the funding community.</p>
<p>From this initial work, Coalition participants realized that creating a strategic 
  plan for technology assistance to the whole region could serve as a key organizing 
  guide. After six months of focused effort, a strategic plan was set that addressed 
  many critical technology issues in the region along with Coalition strategies 
  for meeting them. The plan continues to serve as a guide and is one of the <a href="http://www.techxchange.org">Exchange 
  web site's</a> most useful resources.</p>
<p><b>Ongoing Success</b></p>
<p>As the coalition became more successful, its activities and influence increased. 
  In 2003, the <a href="http://www.nten.org">Nonprofit Technology Enterprise Network 
  (N-TEN) </a>was seeking a location for its first-ever, international conference 
  and selected Philadelphia, in large part because of the cooperation and coordination 
  TechXchange Coalition participants could provide with site selection, securing 
  local funding and sponsorships, organizing a volunteer day of service, and coordinating 
  local logistics. The conference, held in March 2004, drew over 700 people from 
  around the world.</p>
<p>The TechXchange Coalition continues to serve as vehicle for other significant 
  technology activities that impact the nonprofit community. When the <a href="http://mcot.phila.gov/back_pages/ICDL/GPGSC_ICDL.html">City 
  of Philadelphia decided to implement the International Computer Driving License 
  (ICDL)</a> program, a fundamental computer skills training initiative, the TechXchange 
  Coalition was the first place representatives from the City and ICDL approached, 
  knowing that coalition participants would be able to disseminate information 
  and create collaborations to make the ICDL program a success. The ICDL program 
  has now been launched and the first certifications issued. </p>
<p>The TechXchange Coalition has been involved in a wide range of activities in 
  the local CTCNet chapter, presenting at a variety conferences and seminars. 
  Social and networking events have helped NTAPs establish new contacts and expand 
  professional networks. Meetings feature guest speakers from the nonprofit, government, 
  or corporate sector.</p>
<p>TechXchange Coalition resources are informative to any geographic region that 
  contains multiple NTAPs providing a variety of technology programs and services. 
  They show how NTAP coalition-building can strengthen the NTAPs, the nonprofit 
  sector as a whole, and members of the surrounding communities.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">CMT Program </a> at the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/">College of Public and Community Service (CPCS) </a> at <a href="http://www.umb.edu/">UMass/Boston </a> is currently offering a Bachelor of Arts degree in community media and technology, the first of its kind in the country, and a six course/competency stand-alone Certificate. Classes are available on-line as well as in person.</p>
<p>CMT Initiatives include the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">CTC VISTA Project</a>, now in its fifth year, the <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org"><em>Community Technology Review</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.cbcmedia.net/">Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative (CBC)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/eitc">Boston Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Electronic Filing and Technology Access Project</a>. </p>

<p>On September 1, 2004, 40 new CTC VISTAs serving around the country were sworn in by Rep. Barney Frank (MA) during a <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/04_05_pso.html">ceremony</a> following the program's Pre-Service Orientation at the College. Rep. Frank spoke enthusiastically about the importance of public service and the inequities that the VISTA program is intended to help rectify. University Chancellor J. Keith Motley also spoke with appreciation about the importance of the program. The orientation included workshops on community organizing, led by Rich Cowan of the <a href="http://www.organizenow.net/">Organizers' Collaborative</a>, and digital media production led by Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative Director Nettrice Gaskins, as well as a panel discussion featuring CTC VISTA alumni. CTC VISTAs are working in a variety of capacities at community technology sites, including coordinating computer labs, developing after-school curricula, organizing regional CTC networks, and producing community cable access television programming. The PSO also included an orientation to <a href="http://www.americorps.gov/vista/index.html">AmeriCorps*VISTA </a> by Corporation project officers Marsha Colbert and Sherry McClintock.</p>
<p>This year, the Project is being supported by two VISTA Leaders. I am working with Saul Baizman, who had been a CTC VISTA at CPCS last year, and we're joined by Resource Specialist Lauren Penney, who had been a CTC VISTA at <a href="http://www.youthlearn.org">EDC/ YouthLearn</a>.</p>
<h6>The Boston Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Electronic Filing and Technology Access Project </h6>
<p>As presented in last winter's <em>Review</em>, CPCS received a grant in 2003 from the U.S. Department of Commerce Technology Opportunity Program (TOP) to <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=181">develop a low-income community support project using the simplified EITC tax filing software application called “I-CAN! EITC.” </a> I-CAN assists low-income residents in applying for and receiving the full amount of Earned Income Tax Credit due to them, and opens up substantial new possibilities for <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=36">&quot;Putting Money Back into Poor People's Pockets,&quot;</a> as reported the previous spring.</p>
<p>The EITC program brings more people out of poverty than any other federal program, including welfare. EITC is eight times the size of the Workforce Investment Act program and more than ten times the size of Community Development Block Grant funding. Low-income families can qualify for up to $4,741 in federal and state money. But many people are unaware of the EITC and therefore don't apply for it. Many of those who take advantage of the credit pay high fees to commercial preparers.</p>
<p>The purpose of the project is to: </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; Expand the capacity of free tax preparation sites in providing assistance to taxpayers by using I-CAN! EIC. </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; Assess the ease of use of I-CAN! EIC and its capacity to promote greater independence for EITC-eligible individuals when submitting their tax returns. </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; Increase the number of access sites to include CTCs and similar organizations. </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; Provide access to financial literacy information and programs.</p>
<p>In implementing the program for the '04 tax year, CPCS invited Massachusetts CTCs and other community-based organizations to apply for $5,000 mini-grants to develop an outreach and service program using I-CAN.</p>

<p>Nine mini-grants have been awarded to Full Service Free Tax Preparation sites and I-CAN/EITC-Only Sites. Full Service sites have the expertise, staff and full range of software to offer tax preparation to everyone in its service area who is eligible for free tax preparation, whether they are EITC-eligible or not; I-CAN/EITC-Only sites provide services only to those who are EITC-eligible.</p>
<p>I-CAN/EITC Only sites are: the <a href="http://www.ymcaboston.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageID=124">Egleston Square YMCA </a> in Dorchester, and the Timothy Smith Lab at the <a href="http://www.timothysmithnetwork.org/centerDetails.aspx?id=31&display=all">John A.

Full Service Tax Preparation sites include Action for Boston Community Development's <a href="http://www.bostonabcd.org/people/phfnsc.htm">Parker Hill/Fenway Neighborhood Service Center </a> and <a href="http://www.bostonabcd.org/people/sbac.htm">South Boston Action Center</a>, the <a href="http://www.codman.org/">Codman Square Health Center </a> in Dorchester, the Hispanic Office of Planning and Evaluation (HOPE) in Jamaica Plain, and the Roxbury Resource Center of the Boston Office of Jobs &amp; Community Services, and, outside of Boston, the <a href="http://www.newbedford.com/nc3.html">Greater New Bedford Community Computing Center</a>, the <a href="http://www.refugeesusa.org/index.cfm">International Institute </a> of Greater Lawrence, and the <a href="http://www.neighborhoodlaw.org/perl/user.cgi?rm=program_details&program=MJP/">Massachusetts Justice Project in Holyoke </a>. Additionally, the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/taylor_center/taylor_center.html">Taylor Center for Media, Arts and Technology </a> at CPCS is serving as an ICAN/EITC site. Training for grantees took place at the Taylor Center on November 16.</p>

<h3 class="title">Podcasting</h3>

<p>There has been quite a bit of media coverage recently of&nbsp; “podcasting.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">According to Wikepedia</a>: “The term podcasting plays upon the terms broadcasting and webcasting and is derived from the name of the iPod portable music player, the playback device of choice of many early podcast listeners…In short, podcasting involves the recording of internet radio or similar internet audio programs. These recordings are then made available for download to portable digital audio device. You can listen to the podcast internet radio program while you are away from your computer or at a different time than the original program was broadcast.” </p>
<p>Facilitated by a group of software tools (for more details, see “<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/5843952395227141/">How-To: Podcasting</a>”), the practice allows producers to “push” content to subscribers, who can then listen to it at their leisure. Each of the tools is relatively prosaic, but the combination of them opens up interesting possibilities for alternative content providers. The first element involves the now-common RSS 2.0 syndication feed, incorporated into many weblog and content management software packages. When a link to an audio or other multimedia file is included in an RSS feed, a program such as <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/">iPodder </a> at the client end can find and download the file and transfer it to the client's audio library. Top lists of podcast programs can be found at the iPodder.org listing of its <a href="http://audio.weblogs.com/">last 100 podcasts </a> as well as its <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/podcasts">directory</a>, and at <a href="http://www.loudpocket.com/">Loudpocket</a>, the “podcasting portal.” </p>
<p>The technology is still nascent but community producers might adopt it to good effect. Short or occasional content could be easily syndicated, for example, or new audiences reached. While the approach seems of limited benefit to locally-focused programming, more general interest content may benefit. </p>

<h3 class="title">An Interactive, Web-based Training for Teenage Mentors</h3>

<p>Since 1999, <a href="http://www.youthlaunch.org/">YouthLaunch </a> and partner <a href="http://www.bbbsa.org/">Big Brothers Big Sisters </a> (BBBS) agencies in Texas have been working to engage selected high school students as “Teen Bigs,” mentoring elementary-aged youth in need of a trusted friend. Now this collaboration has been given a boost with an online training tool, designed with <a href="http://www.enspire.com/">Enspire Learning </a> to improve and standardize the mandatory mentor training to supplement the in-person training the students receive.</p>
<p>
  In the online application, two fictitious Teen Bigs, Eric and Jaime, guide learners through a series of interactive activities to prepare them for their experiences, with information such as understanding the stages of child development, the importance of confidentiality, and tips for interacting with their “Little.” Students spend between 30 and 45 minutes completing these online exercises, and program staff can track their training.</p>
<p>YouthLaunch hopes that “The Next Big Thing” will establish a new standard for non-profit training. A <a href="http://www.enspire.com/demo/youthlaunch">demonstration can be viewed </a> on the Enspire web site – enter as case-sensitive password the word “pass” and login as any agency and high school in the pull-down menu bars in the log-in box. </p>

<h3 class="title">Open Source Software Development</h3>

<p>A recent concern in software development is to develop software for diverse user needs. This idea of customizing software is crucial because once a custom software is made, not only can users benefit from a specially designed product and work more efficiently with it, but also the technologies themselves are advanced (e.g. Special features are tailored) because of the localization of the software. To bridge the communication gap between developers and users, a viable way is bringing both users and developers together into the development process. This type of community-based development is more likely to lead to a sustainable design, an ultimate user-centered design. Developers are able to pick preferable software from a pool of packages and tailor them for a specific group of users.</p>
<p>The recent project <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Custom Debian Distribution </a> has developed a range of custom software for implementation in specific areas. Debian GNU/Linux is a project that symbolizes community technology at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we see diverse actors involving in the Debian project. More than 16,000 different software packages maintained by more than<br>
  1,000 independent volunteer developers creates a big universe of software.</p>
<p>For example, in the field of education, an internal Debian project has been developed called Debian-Edu, to extend Debian GNU/Linux into an operating system that is designed to fulfill the requirements of small non-profit organizations. The goal of Debian-Edu is a complete system for all common tasks that educational organizations need using 100% free software. </p>

<h3 class="title">Public Policy, Online Content, and Research to Expand Community Access to Digital Opportunities</h3>

<h5>Public Policy </h5>
<p><b> Connecting local leaders to a national network </b></p>
<p> Many of the most innovative digital opportunity policies are happening in states and cities across the country. In order to accelerate the spread of promising policies and key strategies and to help foster a group of leaders on community technology policy, <a href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/"> The Children&rsquo;s Partnership</a> organized an informal group of key leaders involved in local policy efforts. We convened these leaders via phone in late November February to talk about public policy efforts priorities in 2004. and then again in November to talk about progress made.</p>
<p> Over the past year, both states and cities have taken action to create high-speed Internet infrastructures, both landline and wireless. Highlights of this work include Louisiana&rsquo;s plans to spend $40 million on expanding Internet access, and Michigan has already issued approximately $4.1 million in low-interest loans to broadband companies. Similarly, numerous municipalities have developed wi-fi hotspots; while others, such as Los Angeles, New York, and St. Louis, are developing plans to create wi-fi zones. In addition, many rural communities, tired of waiting for the major telecommunications companies to build out a broadband infrastructure, are taking matters into their own hands. Cities such as Provo, Utah, and Danville, Virginia, are in the process of rolling out their own municipal broadband infrastructures. All of this effort toward developing a broadband infrastructure creates an opportunity for community technology programs to tap into this network. A summary report of these initiatives will appear on <a href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/">Techpolicybank.org</a> early in 2005. </p>
<p><b>Preserving Discounts for High-Speed Internet Access in After-School and Other Youth Programs </b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/static/industry/telco/public+programs/ctf_faq.htm">California Teleconnect Fund (CTF)</a> is a public program that provides a 50% discount on advanced telecommunications services and helps save after-school programs and other community-based organizations significant money on their telecommunications costs. At the beginning of 2004, an 86% reduction was recommended in CTF&rsquo;s budget. Through a year-long effort working as part of the <a href="http://www.cctpg.org/">California Community Technology Policy Group</a> (CCTPG), a coalition of more than 200 nonprofit community organizations), the legislature passed a bill &mdash; which the Governor signed &mdash; to restore the funding for these vital discounts. </p>
<h5> Online Content for Low-Income and Underserved Users </h5>
<p><b> Disseminating news relevant to online content for underserved audiences </b></p>
<p> The Children&rsquo;s Partnership continues to report on and advocate for content that is relevant and useful to low-income or other underserved users. We have introduced the <em>Contentbank Newsblast</em>, a weekly e-mail news service designed for community and public interest leaders who want to stay informed about developments in the field of content for low-income Internet users. It covers news stories about online translation tools, Web accessibility for users with disabilities, e-government services, and more. In addition to disseminating content-related news to subscribers via e-mail, we have built an extensive <a href="http://www.contentbank.org/news.asp"> news archive</a> on Contentbank, searchable by both topic and date, where one can easily subscribe to <em>Newsblast</em>.

<p>Last year, TCP staff developed a blogging workshop and presented it to a group of young people at the <a href="http://www/harlemlive.org">HarlemLive</a>, an after-school program in Harlem. According to Rich Calton, founder and director of HarlemLive, &ldquo;Having folks from The Children&rsquo;s Partnership come to HarlemLive and work directly with the teens was invaluable. The teens now have another avenue by which to express themselves. We plan to use the Weblogging workshop from The Children&rsquo;s Partnership as part of our orientation for all new members.&rdquo; The workshop was so well received that we transformed it into a curriculum for youth, which will be available on Contentbank in early 2005. </p>
<h5> Research Preview </h5>
<p><b> Conducting research to examine the benefits of technology to youth </b></p>
<ul>
  <li><em> In 1994, 39% of U.S. households with children had a personal computer; by 2002, 62% had Internet access. </em></li>
</ul>
<p> Wouldn't it be exciting if candidates running for office spoke about what they would do for community technology once they were elected? Wouldn't it also be exciting if you could actually vote for a candidate that pledges to support community technology like funding a pot of money for community technology programs?</p>
  <p>For community technology to get to this stage requires getting our issues on candidates' radar screen. To move us in that direction, the <a href="http://www.cctpg.org">California Community Technology Policy Group (CCTPG)</a>, <a href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/">The Children&rsquo;s Partnership</a>, <a href="http://www.communitypartners.org">Community Partners</a>, and <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org">CTCNet</a> joined forces to initiate a California- and national-based civic engagement project to involve people with the election through technology and to inform candidates about issues surrounding youth and technology. The project educates <br>
future policy makers (candidates for elective office) about what community technology is adn the policies that support it; demonstrate how community technology programs can help promote civic participation; and get on record the positions of future policy makers on community technology.</p>
<ul> 
 <li>In 1994, 3% of public school classrooms had Internest access; by 2002, 92% had Internet access.</li><br>
  <li>74% of online teens now use instant messaging.</li>
</ul> 
<p>While these statistics speak to the extraordinary expansion of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), they don&rsquo;t help us answer questions about whether or in what ways this &ldquo;tech explosion&rdquo; is benefi ting young Americans. For community technology to get to this stage requires getting our issues on candidates' radar screen. </p>
<p> To focus attention on these key questions, The Children&rsquo;s Partnership is conducting original research and analysis to be released in 2005. The study will bring together the best existing evidence of the extent to which ICT delivers better opportunities and outcomes to young people in Educational Achievement, Healthier Life Choices, Economic Advancement, and Civic Participation. Based on this research, this report will also include an &ldquo;index,&rdquo; or measuring stick, to help set a course for how best to invest in ICT with the aim of creating meaningful opportunities &mdash; especially for young people most at risk of being left behind. As always, The Children&rsquo;s Partnership is working closely with a group of leading national experts to develop the index and accompanying recommendations.

<h3 class="title">e-Lection: Using Technology to Involve Communities in the Election Process</h3>

<p><strong>Programs in Brief </strong></p>
<p>The program consisted of two parts: the <a href="http://www.cctpg.org/other/elections/registration.htm">e-Lection Program</a><strong></strong> and the <a href="http://www.cctpg.org/other/elections/youth.htm">2004 Youth and Technology Candidate Information Program</a><strong>. </strong>The e-Lection Program provided a way for community technology programs to engage residents in a non-partisan education and voter registration campaign. The latter provided information about how community technology plays a role in providing access and training in technology to youth, to all of the candidates running for state office and the California delegation of the House of Representatives. </p>
<p><strong>The e-Lection Program </strong></p>
<p>The goals of the e-Lection program are to inform the electorate, teach them how they can make change in their communities, and cultivate candidates to be concerned and knowledgeable about community technology. This is accomplished by providing voters with information they need to make educated decisions regarding elected officials, propositions and access to documents and services they need to participate in election activities. </p>
<p>The e-Lection 101 curriculum teaches people how to use the Internet to register to vote and learn about the election process and ballot issues. Part of the curriculum involves teaching participants how to become educated voters, and provides a list of websites that voters can access that are created by government and non-partisan groups that help them explore and learn more about the candidates and issues that appear on the ballot. The e-Lection 101 curriculum also instructs voters on absentee voting and finding the location of their polling place. </p>
<p>Community technology centers can become advocates for their issues and programs by inviting candidates for public office to learn more about community technology through issue briefings and visits to a nearby community technology programs; this creates an opportunity for centers to interact with potential elected officials. e-Lection provides community technology programs with the tools to engage candidates and provide them with information pertinent to the issues of community technology. One especially successful e-Lection program was implemented by the <a href="http://www.firebaughclc.org/">Firebaugh Computer Learning Center</a>, in central California, which hosted voter education seminars in English and Spanish. The Firebaugh CLC also co-hosted a community/candidates meet and greet, where community members invited candidates to a session to learn about each other, what residents are concerned with, and what candidates feel are priorities. According to Executive Director Linda Lopez, &ldquo;This was a first for Firebaugh. No one had ever organized an event, forum, or any interaction with candidates. We have discovered that our CTC has become recognized as a force for change!&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong>Youth and Technology Candidate Information Program</strong></p>
<p>The 2004 Youth and Technology Candidate Information Program reached out to over 400 candidates running for public office and was created to brief candidates about the issue of technology readiness for youth. By providing information as well as <a href="http://www.cctpg.org/other/elections/2004-candidate-survey.doc">surveying the candidates</a> on the issues of youth and technology, CCTPG was able to prompt candidates to consider the issues and better understand their positions on youth and technology. Results of the non-partisan survey were made available to community technology programs and the public. Responses to the survey also provide community technology programs with better information to plan strategically for the future. </p>
<p>The process of conducting the survey itself is a testament to the use of technology in election activities. By using a web-based survey tool, CCTPG was able to conduct the data gathering online. Candidates also had the opportunity to download a Word or PDF document file from the CCTPG website. </p>
<p>This program was a good opportunity to provide policy ideas to those who would be affecting policy decisions around technology. These policy ideas involve a variety of subjects from partnerships with schools and community technology centers, providing e-government services through CTCs, workforce investment programs and tax incentives for broadband providers to create infrastructure in underserved communities, to name a few. Having CCTPG&rsquo;s name in the eyes of potential public officials also helps to establish relationships with those candidates who are elected to office. </p>
<p>One of the most significant parts of the questionnaire is the section pertaining to the candidates&rsquo; own work relating to youth and technology and recommendations from candidates on steps that should be taken by the state government to ensure technology readiness. One such response was: &ldquo;State Government must itself stay current in its use of technology. Technology provides an opportunity to make government services more efficient, thereby reducing costs. E-government programs that utilize community technology centers for vital business can ease the burden on government offices, and reduce state costs.&rdquo; </p>
<p><a name="_Hlt92218151"></a><a href="http://www.cctpg.org/other/elections/results.htm"> All the responses </a> to the 2004 Youth and Technology Candidate Information program are available for review. </p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned </strong></p>
<p>The e-Lection and the 2004 Youth and Technology Candidate Information program yield some important lessons for community technology advocates. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The program is a valuable way to inform candidates on the issues of youth and technology. Be prepared for follow-up conversations if they have questions on the subject. </li>
  <li>It is important to make sure that all election-related activities are non-partisan. The e-Lection materials included resources to help those planning election information activities to understand what is and is not allowed. </li>
  <li>Be inclusive; reach out to all of the official candidates running for public office regardless of political affiliation. The secretary of state and county clerk&rsquo;s offices will have contact information for all candidates are running for any available office. </li>
  <li>It is also very important to have voter registration and education programs open to all that want to participate, this encourages more people to visit centers and is in keeping with the spirit of non-partisanship. </li>
  <li>Allow time to prepare materials and for candidates to respond to survey questions. Candidates are constantly sent information packets and surveys from a variety of sources, so keeping the information fresh in their minds remains a challenge. One solution is e-mail announcements. CCTPG sent e-mail announcements before and reminders after packets and surveys were sent out to help ensure timely responses. </li>
  <li>Partnerships among centers and other organizations in your community can help reach a broader audience and will ensure that voter education and registration drives reach the most people. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead &ndash; What You Can Do </strong></p>
<p>Now that the 2004 elections are over, the resources can be used for future races, such as local races in 2005, like city council, mayoral, or county level offices. While local races do not generate as much attention as state or national races, they have just as big, if not bigger, effect on community technology programs. Examples of current policies taking place at the local level are broadband deployment, both wireline and wireless, and cable franchise renegotiations, which could lead to funding and equipment for community technology. In addition, because candidates running for local office cover and represent a smaller area and population, they can be more accessible, attentive, and responsive than state or national candidates. </p>
<p>To engage local candidates, many of the materials that were described above can be adapted for local use. The <strong>2004 Youth and Technology Candidate Information Program </strong>can be used to educate local candidates about community technology issues, since many candidates still lack knowledge about community technology. Also, the <strong>e-Lection Program </strong>can continue to engage residents in the electoral process and to educate them about the candidates running for office. As part of this program, sites should host candidates at their centers, providing candidates a first-hand glimpse into the services offered by community technology programs and beginning to cultivate an inside ally who could secure resources for your program. </p>
<p>Another resource to help educate and engage candidates is <a href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/">Tech Policy Bank</a>. At this site, to help you talk to candidates about why they should care about the issue, you will find fact sheets for all 50 states on the technological readiness of your state. In addition, you will find different examples of policies initiated by other cities to increase technology access and use. </p>

<h3 class="title">The New Digital Divide Network</h3>

<p>A new online community connecting practitioners and educators has been launched in celebration of the <a href="http://www.digitaldividenetwork.org/">Digital Divide Network</a>'s five-year anniversary. The online presence of the Digital Divide Network (DDN) formerly provided critical resources such as articles, news headlines and a listserv to policymakers, activists, and citizens interested in improving access to technology and information for underserved communities. In its new incarnation at <a href="http://digitaldivide.net/">digitaldivide.net</a>, DDN is an interactive community for a growing member base who can now create their own blogs, contribute and personalize their own content, communicate with one another on discussion boards and through web-based messaging, and build their own interest-specific communities, all at no charge.</p>
<p><strong>A Brief History of the Digital Divide Network</strong></p>
<p>During the spring of 1999, the AOL Foundation approached the <a href="http://www.benton.org/">Benton Foundation </a> about partnering on a new philanthropy portal called Helping.org. Developed in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nul.org/">National Urban League</a>, the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</a>, <a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org/">VolunteerMatch </a> and a host of other nonprofit organizations, Helping.org was designed to serve as the leading portal for American citizens and nonprofits to get information about philanthropy and volunteerism. When it was launched in October 1999, Helping.org featured four projects: an e-commerce tool that would allow people to donate to any nonprofit in the US; a volunteer placement search tool; a directory of resources regarding nonprofit technology capacity building; and a clearinghouse of news and information on the digital divide. The capacity building section and the digital divide clearinghouse were both managed by the Benton Foundation.</p>
<p>Barely two months after the launch of Helping.org, President Bill Clinton hosted the first national digital divide summit, a gathering of policymakers, private sector leaders, funders and nonprofit activists, in December 1999. Prior to the summit, President Clinton gathered a small group of representatives from the private sector and civil society, including a representative from the Benton Foundation, for a breakfast meeting. During this meeting they discussed the challenges and opportunities for working together to bridge the digital divide. Among the challenges was the lack of a &quot;go-to place&quot; on the Internet where digital divide activists and policymakers could share ideas with one another.</p>
<p>It soon became clear that the digital divide clearinghouse that had been launched as a part of Helping.org could provide the infrastructure for such a meeting place. So on December 9, 1999 during a Rose Garden ceremony, President Clinton announced the creation of a new initiative: the Digital Divide Network, which would be managed by the Benton Foundation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Benton Foundation is bringing together companies from across the computing, telecommunications, software and Internet industries, as well as the Urban League and several other large private foundations, to create the Digital Divide Network, an enormous clearinghouse of information for information on public and private efforts to bring technology to underserved communities. For the first time, we'll have one-stop shop for tracking our progress in every community, and for learning exactly what's worked and what hasn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Later that week, the Digital Divide Network (DDN) went online. The clearinghouse that had been hosted by Helping.org spun off to its own website, www.digitaldividenetwork.org, while the Benton Foundation created an email forum, the DIGITALDIVIDE group, moderated by DDN editor Andy Carvin.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next five years, DDN became the Internet's primary resource for news and information about the digital divide. The site amassed a collection of over 800 news stories, 250 feature stories and 150 online resources on the digital divide. For several years, it also hosted ConnectNet, an online initiative with the <a href="http://www.kff.org/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, the AOL Foundation, <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet</a>, the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">US Department of Education </a> and other national organizations. ConnectNet was an online database of nearly 20,000 public Internet access points in the US . Users could either call a toll-free number or access a Mapquest database to find free Internet access points in their community. In May 2002, DDN joined with OneWorld South Asia to launch the <a href="http://www.digitalopportunity.org/">Digital Opportunity Channel</a>, a sister website focused on the role of information and communications technologies in global development.</p>
<p>By late 2003, it became clear to the staff at the Benton Foundation that the DDN website could benefit from a range of online community building tools. The email discussion list was quite successful, with more than 3,000 members from 70+ countries, but the website was generally limited to article publishing by DDN staff. So DDN began a series of consultations with like-minded organizations, including CTCNet , <a href="http://www.americaconnects.net/">America Connects Consortium</a>, <a href="http://www.youthlearn.org/">YouthLearn</a>, the <a href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/">Children's Partnership </a> and others, to identify online tools that would help evolve DDN from a clearinghouse to a community workspace that would allow digital divide activists to collaborate with each other.</p>
<p>In early 2004, as part of a new partnership with <a href="http://edc.org/">Education Development Center (EDC) </a> in Newton , Massachusetts , DDN and its staff left the Benton Foundation to establish a new institute called the EDC <a href="http://cmc.edc.org/">Center for Media &amp; Community</a>, or CMC. Following the move to EDC, DDN staff began the process of creating a new and improved Digital Divide Network. With grants from the Benton Foundation, the <a href="http://www.timewarner.com/corp/citizenship/education/index.html">Time Warner Foundation </a> and the <a href="http://www.aecf.org/">Annie E. Casey Foundation</a>, DDN partnered with online youth activism group <a href="http://www.takingitglobal.org/">TakingITGlobal </a> to design a new DDN, one that would incorporate a range of collaborative tools for its many users from around the world.</p>
<p><strong>The New Toolset at DDN</strong></p>
<p>In December of 2004, the EDC Center for Media &amp; Community unveiled the new website in conjunction with the fifth anniversary of DDN and President Clinton's digital divide summit. More than just a new website, the new DDN is a unique portal that embraces online collaboration and community building as central goals.</p>
<p>An important component of the new site is that all members can participate in the creation of relevant content. While DDN is continuing its five-year history of publishing news and essays on the digital divide, members are able to publish articles online, post news headlines and events, and start and participate in discussions. Anyone with Internet access can now set up a free DDN account and take advantage of a range of interactive tools, including:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/comm/">DDN Communities </a></strong></p>
<p>The website is organized as a collection of communities, which can be created by any DDN member on any topic of interest. Current topical themes include literacy and learning, content, economic development and &quot;Cool Tools.&quot; Each community serves as a collaborative workspace with its own online bulletin boards, news, events listings and articles. Each community also has a virtual file cabinet that allows users to upload and share documents like PowerPoint files, images, PDF documents and even short video clips.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/blogs/">Free blogs </a></strong></p>
<p>Web logs, or blogs, are one of the hottest trends on the Internet, with millions of people around the world creating their own online journals on subjects ranging from politics to personal development. While some blogging tools require a paid subscription or a high level of Internet skills to get started, any DDN members can immediately begin posting their own blog, without any prior knowledge of the technology. This feature is a great way to facilitate the exploration of blogging as a tool for civic engagement, education and nonprofit communications.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/rss/">RSS feeds </a></strong></p>
<p>Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a tool for allowing Internet users to &quot;subscribe&quot; to their favorite blogs, as well as for bloggers to &quot;syndicate&quot; their blogs on other people's websites. An RSS feed contains computer code similar to HTML, the code that creates Web pages. The DDN website produces RSS feeds for each blog on the website as well as for its stream of news stories and articles. This will allow people who use RSS for syndicating online content or following their favorite websites to keep track of what's going on at DDN without ever having to visit the site directly.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/events/">Events </a></strong></p>
<p>The most compelling events in technology, education and community-building are listed on the homepage and within each online community. Not only are DDN members able to obtain the relevant information for events both in the United States and abroad, but they can also learn what other DDN members plan to attend a given event, making it easy to get together in person. In addition, any member of DDN can list important events on the website.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digitaldivide.net/discussion/">Discussions </a></strong></p>
<p>The new DDN offers lively, user-friendly discussion boards on which to exchange ideas and information about a range of topics related to bridging the digital divide. While the most recent discussion threads are featured on the home page, members can browse through the discussion archives and easily participate in any topic of interest. Any member of DDN can start a discussion thread on any topic.</p>
<p><strong>Member Profiles </strong></p>
<p>Each member has a page on the website dedicated to a unique individual profile that can provide personal information to the larger DDN community. Members can post pictures, list countries visited and languages spoken, contact information, favorite links and communities, and more. It's a great way to put a face and a name to peers from across the country and around the globe.</p>
<p>As always, it's free of charge to become a member of DDN. With member involvement, the site can grow from the premier clearinghouse for news and information on the Digital Divide to the premier online community for educators, thinkers, policymakers and citizens to connect with one another, even while thousands of miles apart. DDN can now more effectively facilitate the exchange of ideas, experiences and strategies for implementing change within underserved communities. </p>

<h3 class="title">Broadband — Why It's Important and Why YOU Should Care</h3>

<p><strong>Why Broadband? </strong></p>
<p>In many communities broadband is taken for granted. But for many in low-income, ethnic, disabled, and rural communities, broadband is not yet a common word let alone an available service. Broadband, or advanced telecommunication services, is the term used to describe a fast way to receive data, voice, and video over the Internet (at least 200 kilobits per second). This service is delivered using a variety of different technologies including: fiber optic cables, T1, DSL, cable, and more recently broadband over power lines and satellite. Broadband is delivered to customers as a service provided by telecommunication, cable, wireless, and more recently energy and satellite companies. </p>
<p><em>Access to broadband  </em>— <em>for everyone  </em>— <em>is essential for full participation and opportunity in the civic and economic life of our society. It's essential for enabling civic participation, for supporting comprehensive strategies to foster community health and development, and strengthening the connections among people. </em></p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>In the community technology field, we used to argue that people needed access to technology and the Internet so they could, for example, be sufficiently technologically literate to get a living wage job, participate on the discounts afforded by online commerce, and access information which is now only  — or most easily  — available online. </p>
<p>Sounds familiar, right? But times have changed, and now people need not just Internet access, but high speed access. Dial up access is too slow and increasingly incapable of accessing the information needed to take advantage of all the benefits the Internet has brought to bear. The problem is only getting worse as technology advances, and websites become more complex and require more bandwidth to load. Broadband is also required to use new and sophisticated applications like databases of community information, distance learning programs, and new technologies like video and voice over IP.</p>
<p><em>Thus, a well planned, well executed, and equitable broadband infrastructure is the foundation for our society in the new information economy. </em>What's at stake here is more than just the ability of any individual to get a living wage job or check out the latest voting statistics. While those are vitally important, what's at stake is the ability of our communities  — urban, suburban, and rural  — to have access to the advantages that advanced technology brings for economic development, education, health, the arts, community development…nearly every facet of our contemporary lives. </p>
<p><strong>Protecting and Expanding the Social Contract </strong></p>
<p>As many exciting new technologies are deployed in our communities, the level of policy discussions has intensified. Some in the telecommunication industry have begun to assert that new services which are IP-based (connected to the Internet) should not be regulated. They do not want to participate in universal service programs at the federal and state level that have provided important subsidies to support education, libraries, health and community-based organizations. Another current policy debate is illustrated by the recent FCC decision which bars states from regulating VoIP (telephone over the Internet), limiting participation in state-sponsored universal service programs. If we are not successful in convincing legislators and regulators at the FCC that services like VoIP should pay into universal service funds then we risk losing the funding base for universal service programs.<SUP><a href="#1">1</a></SUP></p>

<p>Many reports have found that the United States lags behind other countries in broadband deployment (See Graphic 2). Reports have also noted uneven deployment between states and also cities and rural areas. The recently released Department of Commerce NTIA report, <em>A Nation Online: Entering the Broadband Age, </em> shows that more individuals have computers and are connecting to the Internet. The report also shows the growth of broadband and the decline in dialup users, especially for people with higher incomes. (See Graphic 3) In addition, people who have broadband use the Internet more frequently, and use it for more applications. However, the report further documents the concern that broadband is often not available in rural areas. Moreover, what is <em>not </em> highlighted in the body of this report, but rather included in the appendices, is the fact that African Americans, Latinos, and people with disabilities continue to lag behind in Internet and broadband use. (See Graphic 4) It is important to keep in mind that access disparities are much different when subgroups are the basis for analysis instead of these large consolidated groupings. </p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that without pressure from us, policy makers and corporate leaders will blaze ahead with broadband development in ways that will likely leave out community voices. As the data illustrates, broadband is not yet affordable, it is not fully accessible, and in many parts of the country, it's not even available. And, in areas where broadband is available, competing technologies and service providers make the decisions difficult. Thus, we must continue to work with our government and corporate leaders to make sure that plans and policies which promote an appropriate broadband infrastructure are enacted in a manner that includes and protects the needs of our communities. </p>

<p>A social contract, which provided for universal service, was first laid out in the 1934 Telecommunications Act and strengthened in the 1996 Telecommunications Act. <em>Now is a critical time to expand the social contract to include broadband deployment that is available to all communities, accessible to everyone irrespective of language or ability, and affordable. <br>
  </em><br>
  There are several leverage points to expand the social contract. At the federal level, groups such as the <a href="http://www.apt.org/">Alliance for Public Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/">Consumers Union</a>, the <a href="http://www.ala.org/">American Library Association</a>, education groups, and <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/">CTCNet </a> have played a major role in addressing federal policies. There are rumors that Congress will consider revising the Telecommunications Act during the next session. The last time this happened the community technology field was in its infancy, but this time we need to be prepared. We also need to ensure that the federal legislature keeps the pressure on the FCC to maintain and protect universal service. </p>
<p>States also play a critical role in the deployment of broadband. State public utilities commissions currently regulate telecommunication companies and thus have influence through the regulatory decisions they make. Many states have developed “universal service programs,” which support low or no cost access for certain groups so that access can be available to all. California hosts a number of universal service programs including the <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/static/industry/telco/public+programs/ctf_faq.htm">California Teleconnect Fund </a> which provides telecommunication discounts to schools, libraries, community-based organizations, and community-based health organizations. State legislatures and public utilities commissions can also promote broadband deployment. The importance of a ubiquitous advanced telecommunications infrastructure has been recognized by many studies, prompting several states, including Michigan,<SUP><a href="#2">2</a></SUP> Illinois,<SUP><a href="#3">3</a></SUP> Idaho, and Texas, to take action.<SUP><a href="#4">4</a></SUP></p>
<p>We at the <a href="http://www.cctpg.org/">California Community Technology Policy Group (CCTPG)</a>, a collaborative of over 200 community-based organizations, have worked to support the equitable expansion of broadband across the state. We took a leadership role in educating legislators about the promise and challenges concerning broadband deployment in California, and worked with them to pass a law (SB 1563) requiring that the state public utilities commission (PUC), the body which regulates utilities (like telephones and electricity), develop a plan for broadband deployment in California. Our efforts included individual meetings with legislators and their staff, testifying at hearings, and organizing a letter-writing campaign among our supporters. We then worked with the PUC as they developed their plan. </p>
<p>Cities also play a critical role in the deployment of broadband by providing local permits and negotiating local cable franchise agreements. Increasingly, some cities have begun to envision how broadband could be strategically deployed and are integrating this thinking into their planning processes.<SUP><a href="#5">5</a></SUP> The Mayor of Los Angeles has just formed a panel to look at the role broadband and new technologies can play in supporting economic development throughout the city. While some cities, such as Philadelphia, have taken a leadership role in planning for public wireless networks, the telecommunications industry is lobbying state legislators to restrict cities' abilities to establish these public networks.<SUP><a href="#6">6</a></SUP> Community technology advocates can and should create a forum for community technology by proactively becoming part of these conversations. </p>
<p><strong>A Call to Action <br>
</strong>So, you're now convinced that shaping a new social contract which makes broadband accessible, available and affordable is a crucial challenge, and you're willing to take action. Right? </p>
<p>It's important to remember that the more voices across the country advocating for affordable, accessible and available broadband access, the more likely change will happen. A few small actions by many people can help turn the tide. Let us offer a number of ideas and resources you can use to play a part in the push for broadband. </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Get more informed about the issues. </strong>There are many sources for more information about broadband deployment and why it's important. See the box below for some of these resources. </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Choose your strategies. </strong>Broadband is an issue at every level of policy (federal, state and local). Decide where you want to leverage your voice. </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Get involved</strong>. There are a number of groups working to address broadband issues at the federal, state and local levels. Work with your local and regional colleagues to find out what's going on in your area, and who is working on the issues you care about, and join their work. If you can't find a group that's right, then start one! </p>

<p>In 1993, with the push to develop the National Information Infrastructure underway, our Federal government updated its social contract with the American people. The new deal declared a Nation in which everyone, regardless of where you live or how much you earn, would have opportunities to benefit from what the emergent Information Society had to offer. An inclusive, high-performing Information Society was the beacon to which we hitched our wagon.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1995 with publications such as <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/opadhome/digitalnation/index.html#previous">“Falling Through The Net,” </a>the Federal government began to monitor the take-up rates of computers and the budding Internet to guard vigilantly against the harmful consequences of digital disenfranchisement, a reality that, if left unchecked, would only exacerbate economic and social opportunity in the United States. It didn't take sophisticated econometric forecasting to surmise that if computer networks and the Internet allow individuals and communities to do things faster, better, and more cheaply, then making the Internet something for everyone should be a national imperative. Despite progress over the past decade, over 113 million Americans were not using the Internet in October 2003.</p>
<p>The Technology Opportunities Program was a down payment on the Nation's commitment to be among the most inclusive in lifting all boats as the benefits of ICTs were realized through innovations in educational technology, e-government, community technology, and telehealth. Between 1994 and 2004, TOP had the privilege of partnering with 610 organizations, not-for-profit and public, that thought outside of the box about how advanced information and communications technologies could be harnessed to expand economic and social opportunity (<a href="http://ntiaotiant2.ntia.doc.gov/top/index.cfm">a searchable grants database is available</a>). The overwhelming majority of grantees achieved significant results and leveraged the Federal investment with well over a quarter-billion dollars in non-Federal cash and in-kind contributions. These opportunities were made possible because the government took a risk to provide venture funds to organizations others were unlikely to serve.</p>
<p>While we mourn the loss of this wonderful program, we celebrate the lives it touched and the legacy it leaves behind. To recount just one story, I vividly remember meeting in Spokane with Francis Cullooyah, Cultural Specialist for the Kalispel Tribe of Indians. The Kalispel earned a TOP grant to digitize their living culture, including their language, artifacts, photographs, and the <a href="http://ntiaotiant2.ntia.doc.gov/top/details.cfm?oeam=536002019">narratives of elders</a>. Busily shepherding me through the Kalispel “collection” at the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, Francis paused near a beautiful kayak he had built with some younger tribal members, a craft that would be the envy of any contemporary boat-builder. He paused to lament the fact that his ancestors had a name for every tributary of the Pend Oreille, the river his people had plied since antiquity, while at the same time being grateful that the tacit knowledge in his head and those of the other elders, including their dialect of the Salish language, would be preserved. What Francis understood was that the tribe had to capture the past to secure the future, since the loss of their cultural ecosystem would trigger tribal extinction. Public technology was the catalyst that made this process of cultural preservation possible.</p>
<p>I have not known TOP long as its leader. But I want to say thank you to its staff, present and past, that worked tirelessly and were its heart and soul. Bernadette McGuire-Rivera was TOP's administrator and Spiritus Sanctus. Laura Breeden and Steve Downs, TOP's first two directors, established a solid foundation for the program. Much of the program's current staff complement has been with TOP since or near its inception: Judy Sparrow, Don Druker, Francine Jefferson, and Thomas Hardy. Two newer members of the family, Amy Borgstrom and Bart Forbes, brought a refreshing enthusiasm and energy to the program. For them, TOP was not a job; it was a passion. I thank you and the other members of the TOP team for making an enormous difference in the lives of thousands of communities across the Nation.</p>
<p>TOP also has a legacy, I am confident, because organizations like CTCNet and the Association for Community Networking (AFCN) are well positioned to continue the work TOP embodied: that of digital inclusion. I recall fondly my conversation with the CTCNet Board in June 2004 in Seattle. It was clear to me then that CTCNet would be a principal partner in the struggles that would lie ahead. The good news is that CTCNet and AFCN have established themselves as the leading organizations in the community technology space because they achieve demonstrable results. I wish their Boards, leadership, staff, and membership well as they chart the future and seize new opportunities that wait around the corner. CTCNet and AFCN aim high and hope for great things.</p>
<p>It is known that stars emerge out of the chaos and uncertainty of huge clouds of dust and gas. I am sure out of the current miasma, CTCNet, AFCN, and many other organizations will hitch their wagons to newborn stars that will light our way forward as we strive to harness the potential of public technology to become a more just and inclusive society.</p>

<p>This superb collection of essays comprehensively illustrates the potential 
  of civil society to thrive in the globalized, market-driven, transnational, 
  information and communication technologies (ICT) sphere. What emerges in the 
  three sections, &quot;Civilizing the Network Society,&quot; &quot;Global Tales 
  of the Civil Network Society,&quot; and &quot;Building a New Public Sphere in 
  Cyberspace,&quot; is a blossoming use of ICT for civic engagement counterbalancing 
  the commercial pursuits of transnational corporations. The global civil society 
  movement has, as evidenced in this volume, effectively used digital media for 
  social change, from <a href="http://www.indymedia.org">Indymedia</a> web productions 
  around the world to an <a href="http://www.b92.net/">independent radio station 
  in Yugoslavia</a> that presented an alternative to official state propaganda 
  during that country's wars and leadership crises.</p>
<p>The book includes some thought-provoking material of particular interest to 
  the community technology field. In &quot;A Census of Public Computing in Toledo, 
  Ohio,&quot; Kate Willams and Abdul Alkalimat refer to a recent Pew Public Internet 
  Project report that shows that only 51 percent of the adult population in the 
  U.S. is aware of public access computer sites. This would seem to indicate a 
  need for CTCs and other public computing venues to do more community outreach 
  and public awareness campaigns. Susana Finquelievich's article, &quot;Community 
  Networks Go Virtual,&quot; offers a fascinating illustration of how citizens 
  of Buenos Aires used the Internet and the Web to organize political and civic 
  discussions, community meetings, and public protests during the financial and 
  political crisis that gripped Argentina in December 2001. Notably, CTCs, cybercafes, 
  and Internet kiosks provided free or low-cost connectivity for people who lacked 
  on-line access at home, thus providing them the means to stay connected with 
  and participate in the daily events. This active role of CTCs in public discourse 
  and community organizing in Argentina presents an interesting model for CTCs 
  in other countries. </p>
<p>Scott S. Robinson's &quot;Rethinking Telecenters: Microbanks and Remittance 
  Flows - Reflections from Mexico,&quot; proffers an idea to &quot;&#133;expand 
  the extant, fledgling network of community telecenters using either satellite 
  or local Internet service provider (ISP) Internet connections linked with local 
  and regional microbanks.&quot; One wonders whether CTCs in the U.S. and other 
  industrialized countries could partner with such ventures in developing nations, 
  thus providing a vital link between immigrant communities and their homelands. 
  In &quot;Libraries: The Information Commons of Civil Society,&quot; Nancy Kranich 
  describes the digital divide as being not only about computer access but also 
  access to information, what she calls the &quot;digital-content divide.&quot; 
  Kranich suggests that libraries are key public institutions that can help bridge 
  the information gap. It might be interesting to think about how CTCs can play 
  a significant role in ameliorating this inequity, and about the relationship 
  and similarities between libraries and CTCs.</p>
<p>The book also contains some interesting in-depth depictions of the development 
  of community networks. In &quot;A Polder Model in Cyberspace: Amsterdam Public 
  Digital Culture,&quot; Geert Lovink and Patrice Riemens describe how a &quot;Digital 
  City&quot; was built without significant attention to community building, thus 
  failing to form a social network and rendering the project defunct. Fiorella 
  de Cindio, in &quot;The Role of Community Networks in Shaping the Network Society: 
  Enabling People to Develop Their Own Projects,&quot; offers a more successful 
  outlook on civic engagement in <a href="http://www.retecivica.milano.it/">community 
  networking in Milan</a>, though it is clear that this is a foundation that still 
  needs to be built on. David Silver's &quot;The Soil of Cyberspace: Historical 
  Archaeologies of the <a href="http://www.bev.net/">Blacksburg Electronic Village</a> 
  and the <a href="http://www.scn.org/">Seattle Community Network</a>&quot; provides 
  a thoughtful comparison of these two divergent models of network development, 
  top-down corporate sponsored vs. grass roots volunteer-based, and the consequences 
  thereof.</p>
<p>Schuler and Day conclude that there are great possibilities for cyberspace 
  to become fertile ground for a burgeoning civil society in which networks of 
  local and global interests cross-pollinate, and they encourage further research 
  and development to nurture this growing movement. <br>

I've always believed that fairytale princesses reveal much about the societies 
whose collective values they reflect and reinforce. With this in mind, on the 
eve of my departure for a week in Japan, I went in search of the archetypical 
Japanese princess, whom I found in two contrasting realms: 18th century folklore 
and 21st century pop lyrics. In both realms, Princess Peony inhabits a walled garden where she tends flowers 
of exquisite beauty, a loveliness reflected in her person and her retinue of attendants. </p>
<p>As the lyrics of a popular Japanese band confirm, &quot;All girls, In a secret 
  garden, Proceed to become beautiful.&quot;<a href="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></a></p>
<p>But like Rapunzel, Peony cannot be saved from worldly (i.e., male) intrusion 
  forever. One day while strolling near a garden pool, she loses her footing and 
  falls in. Conveniently, a handsome Samurai materializes just long enough to 
  save her from drowning. Smitten by her vanished rescuer, Ms. Peony languishes 
  only to be revived by her troupe of loyal and resourceful peers. With the efficiency 
  of a well-organized sorority, the sisterhood takes charge. They deliver coded 
  messages telling the Samurai of Peony's love, and advise him on how to win her 
  father's approval. Soon everyone is celebrating the royal wedding and the start 
  of an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Not surprisingly, in the iconography 
  of Japanese tattoos, Peony symbolizes wealth and good fortune.</p>
<p>No longer contained by garden walls, Japan's modern princesses, <i>joshikosei</i>, 
  dominate the urban landscape. Fukuoka, the trendy capital of Kyushu Prefecture, 
  proved fertile ground for observing what Sci-Fi maestro William Gibson called 
  Japan's &quot;Mobile Girls.&quot; I saw them everywhere - in underground malls, 
  subways, cafes, schoolyards, and sidewalks, outfitted in sailor blouses, short 
  pleated skirts and baggy socks walking arm in arm, chattering, reading/ sending 
  messages, blushing, flirting, snapping or viewing pictures and thumbing keypads 
  furiously. At the vortex of this multi-tasking was the <i>keitai</i>, or Japanese 
  mobile-phone (which translates as &quot;mobile&quot; with no reference to phone).

<p>Like the intricately decorated fans of fairytale princesses, <i>Keitais</i> 
  are more than mechanical devices. Like the folding fan tucked in the folds of 
  a kimono, the <i>keitai</i> is the ultimate portable accessory, a fashion statement, 
  dramatic prop, social screen, but most powerfully, a medium for covert communication 
  and creating an intimate community. According to Yuichi Kogure, who teaches 
  a class on <i>keitai</i> culture at Tokyo Toita Women's College, &quot;You take 
  your world with you when you have your <i>keitai</i> in your hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Joshikoseis were not the <i>keitai's</i> target market. Originally designed 
  and marketed as business-oriented devices, teenage girls appropriated the technology 
  for their personal communications, and in so doing, co-opted the technological 
  and aesthetic evolution of Japan's most successful digital product. Mobile texting, 
  in particular, was an innovation with origins in pager culture in which girls 
  sent numeric codes to pagers from home phones and payphones. In a study of youth 
  mobile media cultures, Kenichi Fujimoto describes &quot;the girls' pager revolution 
  as a technology-linked paradigm shift, where certain cultural values became 
  embedded in mobile technologies that have now infiltrated the general population.&quot;<a href ="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></a><br>
  <a href="http://www.japanmediareview.com">Japan Media Review</a> reports that 
  70 million Japanese, or 55 percent of the population have signed up for Internet 
  access on their mobile phones, an increase of 300 percent since 2000. In the 
  immediate aftermath of web access, protective Japanese adults registered a collective 
  alarm: <i>Enjokosai</i>, which literally means &quot;compensated dating.&quot; 
  Like courtesans and Geishas of old, the urban legend goes, mobile girls develop 
  sexual liaisons with affluent businessmen to fund their <i>keitai</i> lifestyle. 
  Advertising their availability by punk fashion, these &quot;ko-gals&quot; use 
  their mobile phones to arrange illicit liaisons. While teen prostitution is 
  not unknown in Japan, it is both rare and appears not to be facilitated by mobile 
  phone use. In fact, <i>keitais</i> play an important role in making teens safe.

<p>At a busy hamburger restaurant in Fukuoka, I observed <i>keitai</i> dating, 
  or <i>go-kon</i>, a mysterious ritual whose intricacies had to be explained 
  by my Japanese hostess. Four boys and four girls were facing each other across a table. Talking was confined to whispered messages delivered boy to boy and girl to girl. Under the table (which I couldn't see), everyone was furiously typing on their <i>keitais</i>, showing messages to their neighbors. The closest direct girl/boy contact occurred at the end of the evening, a shy exchange of phone numbers. Other <i>keitai </i>social rituals are documented in &quot;<i><a href="http://www.ojr.org/japan/wireless/1043770157.php">Keitai</a></i><a href="http://www.ojr.org/japan/wireless/1043770157.php"> Log</a>,&quot; a web diary published online by a group of college students researching the role of <i>Keitai</i> in Japanese society. A recent diarist observed that <i>Keitai </i>culture actually strengthens ties between parents and children. 
  She reported that GPS systems are now standard <i>keitai</i> features, and that 
  many high school girls relieve academic stress by text-messaging their mothers 
  during the long school day. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ojr.org/japan/writers/archive.php?personID=333">Mizuko 
  Ito</a> perfectly characterizes the impact of<i> keitai</i> on the urban teen 
  landscape. She writes: &quot;Keitai-wired youth are in persistent but lightweight 
  contact with a small number of intimates, with whom they are expected to be 
  available unless they are sleeping or working. Because of this portable, virtual 
  peer space, the city is no longer a space of urban anonymity.&quot; (<a href="http://www.japanmediareview.com">Japan 
  Media Review</a>, 12/04/04). </p>
<p>As with pagers, the constraints of the <i>keitai</i> keypad have spurred the 
  creation of new modes of communicating. <i>Gyaru-moji</i>, or &quot;girl talk,&quot; 
  mixes Japanese syllables, numbers, cartoon icons and Greek characters into a 
  hieroglyphic script that eludes deciphering by the uninitiated. The fact that 
  it takes twice as long to enter as regular text adds to its popularity as a 
  form of artistic expression and social definition. Recently, young girls are 
  taking advantage of increased bandwidth to handwrite their <i>gyaru-moji</i> 
  messages, which are photographed and sent by email, further showcasing the personality 
  and talent of the sender. </p>
<p>Ironically, the digital revolution of global dimension fueled by Japan's modern 
  princesses is not bringing the wider world to them. Observers of trends in education 
  note the infrequent use of the World Wide Web for formal learning in Japanese 
  schools. The hybrid, scaled down web of Keitai culture provides a canvas for 
  creation, communication and community-reinforcing entertainment - music, videos 
  and even novels are frequently downloaded. Collectively these enrich, intensify 
  and circumscribe an intimate social realm that has been compared to a walled 
  garden, not too different from that graced by Princess Peony and her posse.</p>
<p>It is ironic that Japan's &quot;mobile girls&quot; are not themselves using 
  technology to access a brave new world. But if your walled garden was lively, 
  peaceful, congenial, colorful and subject to the occasional frisson of male 
  intrusion, would you want to leave it? </p>

<h3 class="title">Owerri Digital Village — Teaching Young People to Use Technology to Address Concrete Realities</h3>

The <a href="http://www.youthfortechnology.org">Youth for Technology Foundation 
(YTF)</a> knows that technology is a means to a sustainable livelihood and that 
rural people become more interested in the application of technology when there 
is clear evidence that it can be used to solve concrete and immediate realities 
in their communities. Since 2000, Y f T, has worked to provide technology access 
and training to many of eastern Nigeria's most disadvantaged youth by providing 
them with technology, leadership and entrepreneurship resources at the Owerri 
Digital Village. Eastern Nigeria ranks as one of the poorest regions in Nigeria 
in terms of communications infrastructure, rural development and technology. In 
the late sixties, this region was traumatized by the Biafran war where over two 
million people, including small children, died of disease and starvation.</p>

The Owerri Digital Village is a paradigm community technology and learning center, 
the first of its kind in West Africa, serving rural people between ages 8 and 
25. Many of these young people come from low-income farming communities, are unemployed, 
and in some cases have low educational achievement. The Owerri Digital Village 
is an extended learning model bridging the technology, gender, education and community 
divides. YTF programs are focused on youth as they are quick learners, community 
catalysts, and have the longest productivity horizon; YTF has designed technology 
programs to improve the economic, educational and social status of program participants. 
<p>YTF partners with other like-minded organizations to develop technology programs 
  that are experiential in nature and designed to increase problem solving, critical 
  thinking and communication skills. In January 2003, YTF developed a partnership 
  with theTexas-based John C. Ford Program, the <a href="http://www.geiproject.org/">Global 
  Education Initiative (GEI)</a> project to implement the Young Scientists and 
  Engineers Tele-Academy at the Owerri Digital Village, a program that utilizes 
  open and distance learning [ODL] methodologies to connect rural Nigerian youth 
  with their digital peers in community technology centers in South Africa, the 
  United States, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The program uses a low-bandwidth web-collaboration 
  platform, <a href="http://learnlinc.cogsask.com/">Learnlinc</a>, to produce 
  live video, voice and data sharing between youth and educators, scientists, 
  engineers and business professionals who serve as mentors to the participants. 
</p>
<p>The Young Scientists and Engineers Tele-Academy addresses two of the eight 
  pandemic issues addressed in the United Nations millennium development goals: 
  reducing the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking 
  water and halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The program equips young 
  people with the technology and communication skills they need to be advocates 
  on these issues. Less family income spent on treating HIV/AIDS and water borne 
  diseases means more money spent on education of the children in the family, 
  for instance. Fewer members of a family being sick will lead to a more productive 
  society that raises the overall standard of living for the community. </p>
<p>Chinyere Mbachu, Program Manager at the Owerri Digital Village, explained, 
  &quot;the most effective method to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS and diseases 
  brought about by unclean water is through community awareness and education. 
  Distance learning programs are particularly effective since they would bring 
  state-of-the-art research to communities that are suffering more from a lack 
  of knowledge rather than a shortage of drugs.&quot; The program uses a blended-learning 
  methodology that incorporates online training with onsite education. Distance 
  learning experts in science and technology team-teach with onsite instructors, 
  thereby increasing knowledge transfer and multicultural understanding of the 
  participants. </p>
<p>During the 12-week program, youth are involved in computer and Internet training, 
  online education, science research and group collaboration exercises. Through 
  a combination of one or more of these activities, youth participants coordinate 
  advocacy and focus group meetings with health professionals, analyze and collate 
  qualitative and quantitative data, conduct online research on the global and 
  economic impact of the diseases, and create research and development plans on 
  the topics of HIV/AIDS and water sanitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to make technology interesting to the users by helping them 
  to use technology to research, document and disseminate information about issues 
  that are important to them,&quot; stated Elochukwu Ukwandu, a program manager 
  at the Owerri Digital Village. The Young Scientists and Engineers Tele-Academy 
  adopts a<br>
  virtual business owner format for training. The youth role-play being board 
  members of a research and development firm hired by the World Health Organization 
  to develop measures to curb the spread of these diseases in developing countries. 
  They elect officers, decide on which students will address various sections 
  of the R&amp;D plan, and use simple technology applications including Microsoft 
  Word, Excel and PowerPoint to document the information. The students present 
  their plans to an international<br>
  panel of judges selected from global businesses and international organizations 
  at the end of the training session. The program helps them to develop research 
  skills and acumen while inculcating the self-confidence, communication, and 
  collaboration skills needed to compete in today's 21st century.</p>
<p>To date, over 120 youth have participated in the Young Scientists and Engineers 
  Tele-Academy at the Owerri Digital Village. This is a new paradigm - it is no 
  longer just about learning how to use technology applications but how information 
  technology can provide a bridge between cultures, groom global citizens, and 
  create new ways of learning and teaching that effectively serve more of the 
  world's children.</p>

<h3 class="title">Innovation in Nonprofit Technology: NPower Arizona</h3>

Innovation is not new to nonprofits. Faced with overwhelming community needs and 
tight budgets, nonprofits are always finding creative ways to build resources 
and deliver services. Yet when it comes to technology, many nonprofits don't have 
the resources or support to innovate new technologies or new uses of technology 
in their own work.<br>
This article explores what technology innovation means for nonprofits - how some 
organizations are using technology to increase their impact, and how others can 
take these case studies and replicate the success in their own organization. It 
also discusses the roles that funders and technology service providers play in 
ensuring that all nonprofits have access to high quality, mission-driven technology 
services. 
<p><a href="http://www.valledelsol.com">Valle del Sol</a> is an example of a nonprofit 
  integrating new technology to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of service 
  delivery in the community. The largest Hispanic behavioral health and social 
  service agency in Phoenix, Valle del Sol has case managers visit families in 
  their homes, helping them connect with services for substance abuse, family 
  crisis, and other support. </p>
<table width="20%" border="0" align="right">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As with many social service organizations, much of the one-on-one client work 
  of Valle del Sol happens in the field, while the data so important to facilitate 
  and measure the impact of that work lives in a computer at headquarters. </p>
<p>Valle del Sol saw this as more than just an efficiency issue. They found that 
  clinicians in the field were making notes and completing forms with the knowledge 
  and understanding of the family in front of them, but information and data was 
  being entered later into the computer by other staff without the same level 
  of knowledge about the client. There was a risk of data being entered incorrectly 
  or inaccurately, or funding agencies being billed inappropriately. Valle del 
  Sol wanted to find a way to enable staff in the field to quickly, easily, and 
  securely gather and upload data about clients, streamlining the process and 
  reducing the chance of errors.</p>
<table width="400" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" align="center">

      </div>

<p>Today, the solution is literally in hand. Valle del Sol is introducing wireless 
  personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 60 of its case managers, equipped with 
  software that manages all of the forms and data needed by field-based clinicians. 
  Family members can sign forms on the PDA screen, preventing the need for paper 
  forms. And once the data and signatures are gathered, they are instantly transmitted 
  by wireless communications to the database at headquarters. </p>
<p>Valle del Sol estimates case managers can see as many as two additional clients 
  per day, a 20% increase. Further, Valle del Sol can assure the data is clinically 
  accurate, reducing the risk of data and billing errors. Finally, field-based 
  case managers will have all of the most current data available about clients 
  on their PDA, which is connected live and securely to the Valle del Sol database. 
  This allows them to spot patterns in the data and suggest interventions while 
  they are with the client. These results improve effectiveness and expand the 
  capacity of services provided directly to clients.</p>
<p>For social service nonprofits, the old rules said that clinicians worked with 
  people, while data was often the property of processing personnel back in headquarters. 
  But if real-time access to data can make a difference in service delivery, clinicians 
  need to use it as a tool. </p>
<p>Valle del Sol solved that problem through innovation using wireless technology. 
  They demonstrated the observation by Michael Hammer and James Champy (in &quot;Reengineering 
  The Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution,&quot; HarperBusiness, 
  1993) that &quot;the real power of technology is not that it can make old processes 
  work better, but that it enables organizations to break old rules and create 
  new ways of working - that is, to reengineer. It is this disruptive power of 
  technology, its ability to break the rules that limit how we conduct our work, 
  that makes it critical.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, information technology has significantly changed 
  the way businesses work, increasing productivity, helping create new industries 
  and spurring innovation. Similar to the productivity gains and transformations 
  seen in the private sector, technology has the potential to transform nonprofits. 
</p>
<p>We already have examples: web-based earned income tax calculators that dramatically 
  increase the number of low-income individuals applying for and receiving <a href="http://www.icanefile.com/">earned 
  income tax credits</a>; easy-to-use web sites with self-help legal information 
  enabling legal services providers to serve many more individuals and families 
  (see <a href="http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1036108809.8/digital_divide.pdf">Julia 
  Gordon's report</a> for the <a href="http://www.nlada.org/Civil/Civil_EJN">Project 
  for the Future of Equal Justice</a>); and advocacy web sites such as <a href="http://www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> 
  changing the nature of grassroots engagement. </p>
<p>When we match the positive disruptive potential of technology with the passion 
  and experience of the nonprofit sector, we build healthier, more just communities 
  that can better offer safety, housing, economic opportunity and access to the 
  arts to all members.</p>
<h6>What is Innovation?</h6>
  <p>We can think of innovation existing in &quot;layers&quot;:</p>
<ul> 
 <p><li><b>Adaptation:</b> New ways of doing the same thing (this is how Valle del Sol 
  approached innovation).</li>
  <li><b>Transfer:</b> Applying an existing way of doing something to another activity.</li>
  <li><b>Invention:</b> Envisioning and creating a whole new activity.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>The impact of innovation should be at least one of the following:</p>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Improvements in the way customers experience the organization.</li>
  <li>Direct benefits to customers.</li>
  <li>Expansion of the number, diversity or geographic reach of customers.</li>
  <li>Improvements in business processes that solve problems.</li></p>
  </ul>
<h6>How Can Innovation be Successful?</h6>
  <p>Can other nonprofits envision innovative solutions, as the information technology 
  team at Valle del Sol did? Valle del Sol has more than 175 staff and will invest 
  more than $130,000 in direct costs to develop their solution. How can nonprofits 
  without that level of resources and capacity consider innovation? For that matter, 
  how does any organization replicate their success?</p>
<p>This case study and the literature suggest five criteria for success:</p>
  <p>
<ul><li><b>Investment:</b> technology innovation needs to be seen as a fundamental &quot;R&amp;D&quot; 
  function within the nonprofit sector.</li>
  <li><b>Success Metrics:</b> Projects must articulate &quot;bottom line&quot; measures, 
  which are tied to one of the four potential impacts of innovation outlined above.</li>
  <li><b>Collaboration:</b> in order to make the case for R&amp;D, nonprofits must 
  collaborate to develop tools and strategies that have an impact on customer 
  service and community impact. Funders are more likely to support investment 
  in broader community impact solutions than technology tools for one organization.</li>
  <li><b>Expertise:</b> Experts in the nonprofit world are rarely experts in technology, 
  but they understand their customers. Nonprofits need technologists who do not 
  sell software and hardware, but who take the time to understand and use the 
  expertise of nonprofit staff, like Valle del Sol case managers, to build a solution.</li>
  <li><b>Inspiration:</b> Nonprofits need reengineering case studies published in 
  books and articles; like the corporate sector, nonprofits need an entrepreneurial 
  marketplace to stimulate an ever-growing range of technology ideas and applications 
  for nonprofits. This could also spur collaborative opportunities. At the end 
  of the day, this means nonprofits sharing with one another.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>As nonprofits think about innovation, they will need the support of nonprofit 
  technology assistance providers (NTAPs), such as locally based <a href="http://www.npower.org">NPower</a> 
  programs, that foster the knowledge sharing, understanding of nonprofit expertise, 
  and collegiality that lead to innovation. </p>
<table width="25%" border="0" align="right">
  <tr> 
    <td>
      <div align="center"><img src="/winter-2004-2005/img/mcwhorterphoto3.gif" width="196" height="89" alt="NPower logo"></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These providers should demonstrate and embody the five success criteria of 
  innovation. They should develop technology plans that are mission-driven and 
  build the capacity of nonprofits to serve their communities. They should focus 
  on service more than just technology, posing questions such as &quot;What do 
  your customers need most from you that you aren't delivering?&quot; and &quot;What 
  key population aren't you reaching that you want to?&quot; </p>
<p>This type of inquiry goes beyond simply providing a piece of technology, and 
  will lead to true technology solutions and innovation. NTAPs need to be enablers 
  of innovation focused on improving the quality of life in our communities.</p>
<p>Innovation also requires resources. Funders can help nonprofits accelerate 
  the adoption of mission-supporting technology by providing grants that fund 
  specific technology projects, or by encouraging nonprofits to think through 
  how technology can extend the impact of new or existing programs. Working together, 
  nonprofits, NTAPs and funders can create a culture of responsible, collaborative 
  innovation that will benefit the entire nonprofit sector, and especially the 
  people it serves.</p>
<h6>Conclusion</h6>
  <p>As <a href="http://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/definition.htm">Margaret 
  Wheatley notes</a>, &quot;Innovation is fostered by information gathered from 
  new connections; from insights gained by journeys into other disciplines or 
  places; from active, collegial networks and fluid, open boundaries. Innovation 
  arises from ongoing circles of exchange, where information is not just accumulated 
  or stored, but created. Knowledge is generated anew from connections that weren't 
  there before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Innovation&quot; is a keyword of this century. We hear it from business 
  leaders, technologists and academics. But innovation can begin in anyone's mind, 
  inspired by a desire to make the world a better place. What better minds to 
  put to innovation than nonprofit leaders who are already passionate about service 
  to their communities and earth? Hopefully, this article will inspire at least 
  one leader to imagine an innovation to explore and pass along to the sector, 
  making a difference in the lives of more people, in more communities than previously 
  thought possible. </p>

<h3 class="title">Technology and Grassroots Organizing for the Developmentally Disabled in Atlanta</h3>

On a cool fall evening in Atlanta, dozens of individuals with developmental disabilities 
and their families and caretakers gathered with state legislators to discuss the 
myriad issues surrounding disabilities. Hosted by the <a href="http://www.aadd.org/">Atlanta 
Alliance on Developmental Disabilities</a>, an Atlanta-based nonprofit group, 
the educational forum included a spirited question-and-answer period and opportunities 
for one-on-one discussions between the audience and the legislators afterward.<br>
<br>
Such outlets for feedback and information sharing with key decision makers represent 
an integral component of AADD's mission: to build communities of support for individuals, 
families and children with developmental disabilities. A lofty task, indeed, but 
one that is possible because AADD has harnessed a technology that enables it to 
communicate with, mobilize, and empower its members - while at the same time reaching 
out to new ones. 
<p>Thanks to a web-based grassroots application developed through <a href="http://www.ciclt.com/">Capitol 
  Impact LLC</a>, AADD has streamlined communication with over 5,000 members and 
  similar organizations it partners with in Georgia. The system, which is integrated 
  into AADD's website and powered by Capitol Impact application technology, is 
  designed to allow AADD to personalize and maximize its message to appropriate 
  legislators and provide a network of contacts for its members. Implemented in 
  July 2003, the system has received rave reviews from users and helped AADD mobilize 
  its members -therefore strengthening its voice in legislative arenas. Recently 
  a member wrote to thank AADD for this online system, saying, &quot;thank you 
  for everything your agency does to keep me informed of what is happening and 
  what I need to be doing. Because of your work, parents and caregivers of disabled 
  persons are experiencing success in advocating. This is a good feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>The system's first facet involves a function that alerts members to upcoming 
  forums, issues, and legislation relating to disability issues. Tracking the 
  member's address and voting district, the system provides information about 
  upcoming events, forums and hearings on issues that could potentially affect 
  that member. In addition, the system provides the member with information about 
  his or her corresponding legislator or key decision maker, including contact 
  information and the legislator's voting history, reaction to surveys, and reactions 
  to disability issues. Utilizing such information allows AADD to focus its message 
  and make it more personalized, increasing the potential for the recipient to 
  be responsive to the organization's request for action. With information about 
  relevant issues and the means to contact a key decision maker just a click away, 
  responding and reacting to disability news or issues becomes a simple, quick 
  process.</p>
<p>The system also provides the framework for members to stay informed about upcoming 
  legislation that could affect them - without having to decipher pages of convoluted 
  legalese. Instead, AADD representatives stay abreast of bills in the development 
  stage, earmark those that could affect members, and provide commentary about 
  what the potential legislation would mean for them. Because the information 
  on the system coincides with that of the state's website, it's assured to be 
  as up-to-date as possible.</p>
<p>A third facet of the program provides an immense benefit for graduates of AADD's 
  Partners in Policymaking program, a long-term educational initiative that teaches 
  individuals affected by disabilities how to be self-advocates. The system provides 
  a network of contacts, or partners, grouped by topic areas such as geographic 
  locations, interests, and relevant issues. For example, if a graduate is looking 
  for information or contacts to help advocate for the passage of IDEA, a federal 
  law that protects children with disabilities right to an appropriate education, 
  they can find others around Georgia who have said that they are willing to help 
  in this area. </p>

<h3 class="title">Downs and Ups in Community Technology</h3>

<p>We stumbled onto a most surprising contradiction that informs our current community 
  technology environs while putting together this issue-opposing trends. </p>
<p>On the one hand, in light of the post-election doldrums and confusion, and 
  the loss of energy and resources that generally characterizes the nonprofit 
  sector as a whole at this time, we find a miniscule amount of shrunken funding 
  now being provided to community technology centers directly. The Department 
  of Education's CTC program funding is a mere shadow of what it once was and 
  could yet be. And there's none at all for Community Networking models efforts. 
  The Technology Opportunities TOP program in the Department of Commerce has been 
  defunded and altogether abolished. And this all on top of the suspension of 
  the e-rate program, the country's capstone, multi-billion dollar effort to provide 
  technology access and education equity via subsidized funding for schools, libraries, 
  and rural health centers, amidst charges of fraud and abuse and welfare Cadillac 
  mother parallels, albeit with corporate telecommunications firms and consultants 
  playing the latter role. It is ironic and a comment on our sad situation that 
  we bemoan the withering of this program, given its exclusion of the nonprofit 
  community sector to begin with. The e-rate program would be much more powerful 
  if it reached and helped integrate a stronger and more solidified education-community 
  service collaboration/coalition, as <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/summer-fall-1999/looking_at_erate.htm">David 
  Hughes and Terry Grunwald argued in these pages in 1999</a>. </p>
<p>In any case, our perspectives here begin and end with TOP. We've stopped by 
  there before, <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=67">in 
  the winter-spring of 2002</a>. Now Michael Miranda and Tony Wilhelm offer framing 
  eulogies, a call to arms and a more reflective and intimate summing up.</p>
<p>The surprise is, amidst the gloom and doom, how much excitement and development 
  is going on in the field. Wireless is exploding along with its community applications, 
  giving a real arena and visibility to the call for universal broadband. Blogs, 
  podcasting, open source, and a host of new applications underlie a new vitality 
  and excitement, further evidenced by the development of the Beehive, the relaunch 
  of the Digital Divide Network, the promise of eBay Drop-Off Center community 
  models, the birth of <i>The Journal of Community Informatics</i>, and the other contents 
  of the current issue.</p>
<p>Among the other positive developments, the CTC VISTA project has received its 
  earliest indication to date that we'll be continuing past 2005 — and maybe even 
  have some growth possibilities — all to be confirmed and filled out more fully 
  by the next issue. Meanwhile, the new <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">VISTA 
  Project web site</a>, designed by Assistant Project Director (and CTR designer) 
  Paul Hansen, reflects some of the project's new energy and development.</p>
<p>The current issue comes in at 25% larger than any previous issue, much of this 
  thanks to the good work and efforts of Dan Schackman, new Assistant Editor. 
  The <i>ComTechReview</i> is changing in other ways, too. Our thanks to Richard Civille, 
  who has served as Co-Editor since 1999 up to this issue, and now joins the Editorial 
  Advisory Board, whose full membership will be announced next issue. We'll continue 
  to build on our hard copy-online integrated publishing, thanks again to Saul 
  Baizman — note the highlighted text in the hard copy pages indicates buried 
  links to web-sites in the online version, a style we hope you find combines 
  both easy readability and immediate resource access. As always, we welcome your 
  <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/contact.php">comments</a> and <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/submit.php">contributions</a>.

<h3 class="title">Islands in the Wastestream: CompuMentor Report on Computer Reuse</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.compumentor.org/">CompuMentor </a> has recently released a comprehensive report<a href="http://www.compumentor.org/recycle/RRreport.pdf">, “Islands in the Wastestream: Baseline Study of Noncommercial Computer Reuse in the United States.” </a>In the <a href="http://www.compumentor.org/recycle/RRreport_exec_final.pdf">Executive Summary</a>, the purpose of the study is outlined:</p>
<p>“The United States faces a unique challenge and opportunity regarding the disposal of obsolete computer equipment. On the one hand, three-quarters of all computers sold in the United States remain stockpiled in businesses and homes. On the other, thousands of schools, nonprofits, and low-income families could greatly benefit from access to this resource. Unfortunately, no direct nationally based distribution system links this supply with this demand. CompuMentor's Baseline Study of Noncommercial Computer Reuse in the United States examines the computer reuse field to establish the quantity, quality, and overall effectiveness of computer reuse taking place in the Bay Area and, to some degree, the rest of the country. The study also profiles how businesses fit into the field of charitable computer reuse.”</p>
<p>Among the findings, “demand for low- or no-cost computers is high and currently largely unmet in the San Francisco Bay Area and the US ,” and “noncommercial computer reuse demonstrates increasing potential to fulfill these needs…”</p>
<p>The Executive Summary concludes: “CompuMentor is now undertaking a comprehensive body of research, coordination, and hands-on projects to deepen public knowledge of computer reuse and refurbishing…Tremendous growth potential for noncommercial computer reuse and refurbishing exists in the San Francisco Bay Area and the US . The field could divert much material from landfills and also help remedy the digital divide both in the US and in other parts of the world, including developing countries.” </p>

<h3 class="title">Powerbullet Presenter</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.powerbullet.com/">Powerbullet Presenter </a> is free software for Windows that let's you create simple Flash slideshows with graphics, text, animations and accompanying MP3 audio. The audio could be music, narration, or a combination of both. Although PowerPoint is the standard presentation software used around the world, Powerbullet Presenter has some qualities that put it ahead of PowerPoint. It's simple to learn and the Flash files it creates can be viewed and heard on Windows, Macintosh and Linux <br>
computers. One of the features I like most is the navigational arrows that Powerbullet automatically adds to your slideshows. One drawback of Powerbullet Presenter is that you need to create your MP3 audio files outside of the program using some other software. Come to think of it, you could use some of the MP3 audio files from <a href="http://www.freeplaymusic.com/">freeplaymusic.com </a> in your Powerbullet presentations. <br>
<br>
What I like most about Powerbullet Presenter is that this software can give youth and adults practice creating multimedia using graphics, text and audio either on computers at a CTC, on a donated computer at home, or at both locations.&nbsp; In the long run, it's the content of the stories you tell that matters much more than which software tool you used to create them. Powerbullet Presenter lets many new voices be heard. </p>

<p>Edited by Marita Moll and Leslie Regan Shade<br>
Publisher: Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives <br>
Hardcover: 412 pages <br>
&copy; 2004 <br>

<p>For many, reading about policy isn't exciting or enticing, but fear not. Without essentializing issues, <strong><em>Seeking Convergence in Policy and Practice: Communications in the Public Interest Volume 2 </em></strong><em></em>does its utmost to provide a clear, lively and concise mix of institutional analysis, case study findings, and examples of new directions that digital activists, indymedia and civil society organizations are charting. The resulting volume has an attractive density—in fact, the book weighs in at over four-hundred pages! If you're fed up with conceptions of “new media” as cyborg-filled, alienating and ethereal—or conversely as an inherently positive tool for democracy and freedom—this book may be the antidote.</p>
<p><strong><em>Seeking Convergence </em></strong><em></em>creates a variety of windows into current debates over new media. Following the release of their first co-edited volume, <strong><em>E-Commerce vs. E-Commons: Communications in the Public Interest </em></strong> in 2001 <em>, </em> Marita Moll and Leslie Regan Shade have educed a new set of essays of value to students, educators — and ideally policy-makers — because of the insight into communicative practice and policy-making they provide in this post 9-11 era. A s contributor Michael Gurstein writes in his opening, this is a time when “The early promise of the Internet as providing an alternative to centralized concentrations of power and as a means for widely dispersing economic opportunity has faded.” More pertinently, what remain are the ways and reasons why the Internet and other communications technologies have become part of our everyday lives.</p>
<p><strong><em>Seeking Convergence </em></strong> is effectively organized into two sections: policy and practice. This arrangement creates an element of plot, leading us through the complex histories of the stakeholders and into present debates, demonstrating the major players in action and leaving an open ending; a mix of ‘to be continued” and “choose your own adventure.” Tough questions are posed; how will you respond?</p>
<p>Applying the perspective of political economy, t he authors of these chapters – including Vincent Mosco, Darin Barney, and Michael Gurstein – form a call that ignites debate over the consideration of ICTs as public goods, protests media concentration, and demands accountable governance. Moll and Shade provide readers with a chisel to get through glossy messages created by corporations and governments and carried to us by mainstream media. <strong><em>Seeking Convergence </em></strong><em></em>is a tool that can pull us out of complacency and toward understanding why we need to be involved in making the policies that govern our everyday interactions with technology. </p>

<p>Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been around since the early 1970s and social research in this sector has entered a new phase led by the emergence of “new media” – the current technology and cultural industry. Digital convergence or the merging of broadcasting, multimedia or digital media, information systems and computing has had a big impact on new media research in the early part of the 21 st century. The cultural and social implications of recent developments such as broadband/Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) still remain to be seen but scholars and social researchers from all over the world are exploring and examining these new information and communication technologies and their social contexts .</p>
<p><strong><em>The Handbook of New Media </em></strong>creates a framework for new media or ICTs both internationally and across several disciplines. The book provides a timely report on the current &quot;state of the art&quot; of the field . Here, new media is defined as “information and communication technologies and their associated social contexts, incorporating: </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; The artifacts or devices that enable and extend our ability to communicate; </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; The communication activities or practices we engage in to develop and use these devices; and </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; The social arrangements or organizations that form around the devices and practices.”</p>
<p>The movement to expand the field of new media includes research, definitions, characteristics, and new developments. Rather than focus on specific areas researchers are looking at a broad, not always inclusive, range of contexts, including education, technology design and development, organizing, information systems, policies, and culture.</p>
<p>For example, Douglas Kellner highlights “multiple literacies that are evolving and shifting in response to change and recent developments of ICTs. Along with reading and writing, practitioners and educators need to develop new forms of computer, media and multimedia literacies, including curriculum and training programs. These “multiliteracies” will require new skills and competencies to effectively address the issues and challenges of our contemporary society. Leah Lievrouw explores new media technologies that “develop in dynamic environments where users, designers, manufacturers, investors, regulators, distributors and others work out their interrelated and competing interests…”</p>
<p>What interested me most about <strong><em>The Handbook of New Media </em></strong> was the mixing of technological topics with cultural contexts and issues of social change. I liked that the authors identify the traits or features of new media such as interactivity, time shifting, virtuality, and anonymity and how it is becoming more difficult to distinguish and regulate new media, or ICTs compared to traditional forms. It continues to be a challenge for community technology and media centers to carve out a place in this emerging sector. Practitioners and educators must engage across multiple areas, look across programs and services and levels of expertise to insure that their communities participate fully in an ever more changing and complex world.</p>

<p>The <em>Community Technology Review</em>, aimed at and largely written by practitioners in the United States, has always valued and sought out those innovative programs and individuals in higher education who are bringing theoretical, evaluative, and research perspectives to bear upon the field. Indeed, our home in the emerging and developing Community Media and Technology program in the College of Public and Community Service (CPCS) at UMass/Boston underlines that concern to build firmer bridges between the university and the field of practice, theory and praxis, thought and action.<a href="#_ftn1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em><a href="http://ci-journal.net"><i>The Journal of Community Informatics</i></a></em> is similarly oriented, but from the perspective of the academy, and it is emphatically international in scope.</p>
<p>In announcing its premiere issue in early October, Editor-in-Chief Michael Gurstein spelled out: "<i>The Journal of Community Informatics (JoCI)</i>…is a peer-reviewed Open Archive on-line quarterly journal for and by the Community Informatics research community and produced under the auspices of the <a href="http://www.ciresearch.net/">Community Informatics Research Network (CIRN)</a>." <em>JoCI</em> reflects and is meant to provide leadership in the development of the discipline dedicated to enabling communities with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).</p>
<p>"CI" and "ICT" are the increasingly familiar acronyms for the names of the academic field and the emerging technology arena that are well-known in circles where community media and technology is taught and practiced outside the U.S. Canada, South Africa, India, Latin America, Russia—these are the geographic arenas covered by name in the issue's table of contents. Section editors and editorial and review board members come from here, too, and from New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, the West Indies, and the U.S., a substantial coming together from all over the world to represent—and help shape the field.</p>
<p>Especially since the first Global Congress on Community Networking held in Barcelona in November 2000 and, more recently, the UN-supported World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva in December 2003, academicians and practitioners across the globe have become more aware of each other's work and are playing a growing role in U.S. consciousness about community technology. <em>JoCI </em> will undoubtedly grow as an important venue to learn from and become involved with.</p>

<ul>
<p><li> A description of an ambitious current research project examining the impacts and outcomes of government support for community technology with an overall objective of providing insight toward the future of such programs and their impact on the larger society.</li>
 </p>
</ul>
<p><a href="www.cracin.ca">The Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN)</a>  is a collaborative partnership among academic researchers and practitioners in Canada (and elsewhere) and the three principal federal government departments promoting the "Connecting Canadians" agenda to develop publicly accessible Internet services. Central issues include an examination of how the Canadian community-based initiatives contribute to the amelioration of "digital divides"; the enhancement of economic, social, political and cultural capabilities; the creation, provision, and use of community-oriented learning opportunities; and the development of community-oriented cultural content, open source software, learning tools, and broadband infrastructures. For those in the U.S., the effort can be usefully compared with the federal <a href="www.ed.gov/fund/grant/apply/AdultEd/CTC/index.html%20">Community Technology Centers (CTC) program</a> in the Department of Education  and the <a href="www.ntia.doc.gov/top">Technology Opportunities Program (TOP)</a> in the Department of Commerce. One can glean from this, too, Canadian perspectives and practices that are influencing the entire international arena, so the particular Canadian experiments and programs reviewed here, the literature referenced, the seven community projects and case studies (ncluding K-net), and work to come are important resources for practitioners everywhere. </p>
<p>Moreover, the article is especially useful in helping practitioners as well as academicians keep focused on the community-building aspects of "community networking"—the broad term used to cover CTCs and the wide range of nonprofit/nongovernment technology efforts as well as community networks as they are generally understood in the U.S. Repeated reference to "participatory action research" reminds us how research can contribute to helping build the projects being studied by providing research resources and skills directly to practitioners. The broad historical perspective the piece brings to the decades-old movement, originating in the seventies, and an emphasis on how concerns have moved away from "access" per se to considerations of "effective use" are also helpful. Finally, this is all presented in a context of diminishing resources being targeted towards "digital divide" programs in Canada in a way that helps us appreciate that the cutbacks going on in the United States—most recently and dramatically with the defunding of TOP—is not only the policy of a particular regime but is a broader trend in the development of information and communications technologies, something that can help shape and inform digital equity and community development efforts everywhere. </p>

<p>The article details the connectivity solutions, business model and "organisation" in place that provides the three-pronged foundation for bringing radical change to rural India. </p>
<p>With an infrastructure of fibre which has been brought to almost every <em>taluka </em> (county town) in the country over the last fifteen years by the state-owned telecommunications provider, BSNL, and low-cost base station technology to serve as hubs for the 300-500 villages with a 30 km radius of each <em>taluka</em>, as the authors conclude, "technology is not a serious issue." (In fact, it's been deployed in Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria, Tunisia, South Africa, and Singapore.) </p>

<p>In rural villages, where affordability is low, a business model has evolved from the successful spread of urban telephony in the 80's, when operator-assisted telephone booths or PCOs were set up on street corners and manned for 16 hours daily, spreading like mushrooms along with the stream of entrepreneurs to operate them. To spur the development of rural Internet kiosks with a middle tier of local service providers to provide maintenance, connectivity, and technical support, n-logue has been chartered as a rural service provider to provide commercial telephone and Internet connectivity to every village. The article provides additional technology and cost detail as well as reviewing the range of services being developed that respond to rural needs: in communications, education, agriculture and veterinary support, health care, e-governance, and entertainment. </p>
<p>Although the article provides no links, <a href="http://www.n-logue.com/">www.n-logue.com </a> provides additional detail along with a map of some three dozen sites that have implemented the model and approach for developing India's 600,000 rural villages with a population of 700,000,000.</p>

<p>This brief but pointed critique is aimed at students, researchers, practitioners, and activist ICT non-governmental organizations who are "committed to a rustic, ingenuous 'better connectivity = enhanced democratic culture' strategy," a position which “too often ignores the power of national elites who have configured their regulatory regimes to favor quasi-monopolistic market dominance in cahoots with foreign IT hardware and software interests."

<p><li> A path breaking approach to applying an analysis drawn from the methods and insights of Social Anthropology to ICT design and development as a response to rural poverty.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>Based on an in-depth composite picture of &quot;Jose Miguel&quot; and rural life in Latin America, the authors, based in Intel's People and Practices Group, illustrate how an appreciation of actual rural conditions can point to design alternatives that make effective use of ICT more possible in such locales. Limited access to power cords and grid sources of reliable electricity in irregularly heated rooms where dust frequently falls from adobe ceilings are environmental factors contributing to the existence of "digital divides" that connectivity, hardware, and software will not address. The appropriate burden is not primarily on those with limited access but with technology developers who have limited understandings in design for local use. Computers designed to run on different sources of power, for instance—propane, wind, sun, and car batteries as well as electricity—suggest the real meaning of appropriate technology.</p>

</ul>
<p>Limited use of ICT in the politically problematic environments of the post-Soviet Commonwealth (<a href="http://www.cisstat.com/eng/cis.htm">CIS</a>) informs the potential role CI can play. Echoing Scott Robinson's analysis, Stafeev warns, given the current governments: &quot;We can, with a high degree of certainty, foresee wide use of sophisticated municipal information systems ... for personal benefit and also for enhancing inequality (of property, information and so on) at the local level.&quot; </p>

<p>CI can play a key role in possible constructive development: &quot;Under such conditions the position of the social researcher as an individual citizen becomes most important: rejecting the status of courtier counselors and ideological legitimators of the existing order with the researcher in this instance taking the role of social critic. And here, according to the author's opinion, lies the potentially high value of using the CI approaches in our countries—and principally through the humanitarian, value-dependent direction of these studies.&quot; CI provides &quot;a highly effective methodology of alternative (independent) 'interactive monitoring' capable of fixing, measuring and analyzing the technological and socio-cultural factors which appear in the course of ICT programs realization and which usually stay outside the attention focus of the specialists responsible for results estimation.&quot; Such a role also requires &quot;collaboration with civil society institutions which are themselves capable not only of impartially criticizing state policy but also of developing strategies and methods for constructive cooperation.&quot; See also the author's <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=121">&quot;Community Networking in Post-Soviet Russia.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Women clearly have a central role in policies promoting social inclusion using ICT and e-government, since women are the main users of public services and many of the groups Women Connect currents supports provides frontline public services. National policy context work has focused on government plans to establish a new single "Commission for Equality and Human Rights," a proposed "gender duty" that marks a radically new approach after three decades of legislation that takes on discrimination only <em>after</em> it occurs, and possibilities for the first major overhaul of laws surrounding prostitution in almost 50 years. Women's groups are aware that as more services become available through the web and other ICT tools, older women, the disabled, and women whose first language is not English are at special risk of continued exclusion. </p>
<p>UK policy work is intimately tied to European/regional and international developments through the influence of the UN and international and women's organizations—the UN Convention on the Discrimination of Women which established the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Beijing Plaform for Action, and the Women's Networking Support Programme at the Association for Progressive Communication.</p>

<h3 class="title">Blogging for Your Community</h3>

<p>You've probably heard about blogs in the news of the recent elections. They are far more than a platform for a single author to make his or her opinions public; they can used in a variety of ways, limited only by the imagination of the publisher.<br>
  <br>
Blogs have given not only individuals but groups of all sizes the ability to reach out to the general public and inform, educate, and communicate. For the first time since the Internet came into being, you can publish in the same way that was once restricted to those with specialized skills and/or a big budget. Whether your community is urban or rural, large or small, a blog can make communication far more productive.<br>
<br>
Where an e-mail discussion group or listserv can also be immediate, the original message is often difficult to find in an active list. The fact that it is e-mail also adds to the glut of e-mail most computer users suffer, not to mention that important alerts or updates can be lost in software designed to protect users against spam. A traditional static website cannot provide the interactivity of a blog, and does require a certain amount of technical skill to maintain. With a blog, you have the main benefits of the listserv and website combined, and a larger pool of volunteers you could consider to maintain the site, since they require little specialized training.<br>
<br>
Anyone with the ability to use a word processing program, such as MSWord, who is comfortable sending e-mails and surfing the Internet, can be a blog publisher.<br>
<br>
Once the blog is established, it takes no more time than writing an e-mail. It doesn't need to be updated every day or every week, and it doesn't require lengthy entries, or even that all entries be the same length. Because a blog is so easily used, your designated bloggers can make blog entries themselves at any time of day or night, when it fits their schedule. It can replace such things as newsletters and telephone trees, allowing an infinite number of people to get the same message all at once. It ensures no one is left out, because the entries stay online and are archived for future reference, and can be accessed by the readership at their convenience.<br>
<br>
The RSS feed is the thing that makes a blog really stand out in functionality. When a blog is updated, the RSS feed allows the blog itself to alert directories and aggregators that send the latest headlines and links to subscribers. This gives your blog a level of automatic outreach not possible with either a website or a listserv. People looking for the kind of information you provide (or groups such as yours) can find it quickly through their aggregators. This also eliminates the days or weeks of delay while waiting for a traditional site to be added to search engines, plus the extra time needed to rank prominently enough in those listings to be easily found by the public.<br>
<br>
New visitors do not have to join a list, or search for contact information if they have questions or comments. They can leave a comment in the section provided with each entry, and anyone who has an answer can respond. Their question doesn't have to wait for a webmaster or the main blogger to answer it, which can promote more active participation by community members on the blog.<br>
<br>
To get to the nuts and bolts of the thing, all you really need to know is that a blog is a website than can be updated as often as desired. It can be maintained by one or any number of people you choose. It can be public and available to anyone, or it can be password-protected for a limited readership. Depending on your level of technical expertise, you can use software on your computer to put a blog in webspace you already have, or use a host, such as <a href="http://www.blog-city.com/">Blog-City</a> or <a href="http://www.tblog.com/">tBlog</a>.<br>
<br>
When you use a host, the more technical concerns are handled by the host's staff, so if some element of the blog isn't working, or you find you need more information on some aspect of the blog, you can e-mail tech support for help. All the hosts provide step-by-step instructions for getting started and keeping things going. A note here on choosing a host: while there are literally dozens of blog hosts available, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> and <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">Type Pad</a>, which are the best-known, are more focused on personal publishing, a lone author without the need to carefully track numbers of visitors or perhaps add future advertising, or a different kind of gutter content (links or graphics at the sides) than allowed for in their applications.<br>
<br>
It's important to choose your host carefully. That's because once established, it's difficult to move a blog to a host that better suits your needs. That's especially true if you've listed your blog in a number of directories in order to build your readership. Moving becomes the same exercise as starting at the beginning, so try to avoid this situation if you can.<br>
<br>
<strong>Some Examples of Blogs for Community</strong><br>
<br>
I maintain a blog for the <a href="http://yumatech.blog-city.com/">Yuma Technology Consortium</a>, which is a committee of our local Chamber of Commerce. I have links to local city and county agencies, helpful websites with tech and business information, and those groups and individuals who participate in YTC. As the lead blogger for the website, I try to keep informed on issues that are important to the group itself, or members of the community who have an interest in these issues and post useful links and articles as the content.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.sanleandrotimes.com/index.html">East Bay Publishing</a> and <a href="http://somervillenews.typepad.com/the_somerville_news/">The Somerville News</a> are more general-interest publications.
<p><a href="http://www.globalprblogweek.com/">Global PRBlog Week</a> supported the first online event of its kind. The blog was used as the actual space for the conference; &quot;speakers&quot; posted their presentations and took questions through the comments section or e-mail. The full conference is still freely available and contains many articles for further reference.<br>

<p>Beginning in 2000, a group of software programmers, radio techies, university researchers, system administrators, entrepreneurs, and social activists in central Illinois began discussing ways to set up a community-operated wireless network to provide Internet and intranet services to local citizens. The early planners imagined a communications system that would allow citizens to buy bandwidth in bulk from a high capacity backbone and then distribute it wirelessly through a network of rooftop antennas, or nodes. The result would be a low-cost, ubiquitous cloud of wireless connectivity for local communication. In simple terms, it would mean greatly expanded high-speed access to the Internet for citizens, city government, local business, and local schools. Beyond that, within the grid (or mesh) of nodes, a local network platform would also be created, a high-speed <em>intranet</em> with the potential to serve as a conduit for data, audio, video, and voice. It would be built and administered by the community it would serve. </p>

<p></p>
<p>After two years of extensive work, the <a href="http://www.cuwireless.net/">Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network (CUWiN)</a> set up its first multi-hop, bandwidth-sharing, wireless &quot;cloud&quot; (an area of wireless connectivity composed of at least two interconnected wireless nodes). From this modest beginning, CUWiN has grown to become one of the foremost open-source, dynamic, mesh R &amp; D wireless initiatives in the world today &ndash; with a mission to <em>connect more people to Internet and broadband services; develop open-source hardware and software for use by wireless projects worldwide; and, build and support community-owned, not-for-profit broadband networks in cities and towns around the globe. </em>CUWiN is a non-profit organization and gives its software away for free to anyone interested in setting up wireless networks &ndash; relying on grants, voluntary donations, and volunteered programming time to build the project. Since 2002, CUWiN has deployed additional nodes in the community and dramatically enhanced the networking software. Today it is the most sophisticated open source mesh wireless routing software in existence, a system that has solved some of the scaling problems that have fettered the most successful of commercial operators. </p>
<p>CUWiN's initial deployments brought major press coverage and created opportunities for over two-dozen organizations to partner with the project. Programmers and engineers from around the world joined a growing list of developers. The hardware and software designs benefited enormously from this collaborative period of innovation. In the summer of 2003, CUWiN received an exploratory grant from the <a href="http://www.thresholdfoundation.org/">Threshold Foundation</a> to buy additional equipment as a proof-of-concept for deployment in communities in developing countries. Since that time, CUWiN has been building a new generation of hardware &ndash; chosen for its durability (the nodes are solid state with no moving parts), price, and suitability for network applications. The Threshold Foundation grant allowed CUWiN to double the number of nodes in the test-bed network, experiment with different hardware, and standardize our system specs &ndash; setting the stage for the numerous improvements CUWiN has made since that time. </p>
<p>As of this writing, CUWiN has grown to over 175 members and a test-bed network of three wireless &quot;clouds&quot; serving over twenty different locations: the first cloud had nine nodes, is roughly oval shaped, and spans a half-kilometer area; the second is composed of four nodes in a roughly triangular shape spanning several hundred meters; the third cloud is composed of five nodes spanning several city blocks. Within the local community there is a sizable waiting list to join CUWiN, and we are currently scheduled to build out a minimum of 32 nodes by early 2005. In addition, the City of Urbana recently allocated funding to build an additional 25 nodes in the downtown area. CUWiN is currently adding one node approximately every week; eventually, as isolated wireless areas grow, distinct clouds will merge to create a single trans-neighborhood, interconnected wireless area. </p>
<p>In March 2004, the CUWiN project received a $200,000 grant from the <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/information">Information Program</a> of the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Institute</a> to develop the network as a model for transfer to other communities worldwide. In July 2004, the <a href="http://www.cnt.org/">Center for Neighborhood Technology</a> began using the CUWiN software to help bridge the digital divide in North Lawndale (near Chicago). Currently, over 25 different communities worldwide are looking at CUWiN's software. In fact, anyone can use CUWiN's software and, as an open source project, people are encouraged to get involved with CUWIN, help develop CUWiN's software, and/or build their own Community Wireless Networks. In August of 2004, CUWiN co-hosted the first ever <a href="http://www.communitywirelesssummit.org/">National Summit for Community Wireless Networks</a> at the University of Illinois, which drew over 200 wireless developers, implementers, and spectrum policy analysts from across North America. </p>
<p> CUWiN exemplifies a growing movement to develop non-profit, open-source solutions to wireless networking, even as the commercial telecommunications industry jockeys for position in what they see as a booming future market. Community Wireless Networks offer extraordinary social benefits because of the nature of the technology, and because <em>public service</em> is their explicit purpose. At a basic level, they increase the number of speakers in the public sphere by decreasing the costs of Internet connectivity and lowering barriers to access. The intent is to provide service for the lowest possible costs, not to extract &quot;market prices&quot; for broadband. Further, the community mesh network model is far more than an ISP; it offers not only connection to the Internet, but it also provides an <em>intra</em>-net, a local network for sharing community media, educational content, or public services. With the bandwidth capacity in these networks, every citizen can become an Internet broadcaster or a publisher. Using the local intranet, communities can set up forums for political debate, artistic display, or educational fare. Streaming video and audio from local events &ndash; from town council sessions to PTA meetings to the annual jazz festival &ndash; can be easily accommodated. Administered properly, this virtual public space will recreate a commons accessible to all citizens. Public safety and social service groups, local schools, churches, and municipalities have embraced this technology (especially because of its enormous cost savings over many other infrastructure options). Not only are these institutions able to use the entire network, they are encouraged to build their own local applications. </p>

<p>A core mission of the CUWiN project is to connect end-users to broadband services &ndash; to both create network access to web services for our entire community and establish a model that can be replicated in countless different communities around the globe. CUWiN plans to provide web resources for its service community. This project aims to change the &quot;cultural economy&quot; of the Internet by creating resources for people to democratize media distribution and information dissemination by leveraging an already existent rooftop wireless network. &quot;Cultural economy&quot; refers to the distribution of the power to create and share cultural products. The Internet has a great potential for democratizing the cultural economy of the world; however, its current structure favors highly capitalized publishers of popular content (e.g., nytimes.com, cnn.com) over popular publishers with low capital (<a href="http://www.indymedia.org/">indymedia.org</a>, &quot;slashdotted&quot; websites, the sites often linked to from popular web news site). As a next step, CUWiN plans to build community web-hosting services into the wireless network &ndash; allowing users to host websites and e-mail accounts, stream audio and video programs, and create dynamic media of all sorts utilizing the resources provided on the network itself (i.e., without having to access the outside Internet). These additional services provide the infrastructure to allow for low-capital, at-home broadcasts of locally produced media, an integrated system that will provide the independent musician or journalist with a medium that places them on a level playing field with national websites and broadcasters. </p>
<p>Wireless developers and implementers from around the world are watching this cutting-edge research and development initiative to see how they can use it in digital divide solutions they are implementing. Community Wireless Networks have the potential to create state-of-the-art, non-profit, media systems provisioned by the publics they serve. Community Wireless Networks are intended to be built, operated, maintained, and expanded by the local people and communities that use the system. They offer jobs, technical training, and the empowerment of contributing to community development from the ground up. Though system design will vary with geography and population density, community wireless technologies are explicitly transplantable. They have the capability to spread from town to town, adapting services as they integrate with the needs of a given community. In comparison to their commercial counterparts, Community Wireless Networks pass far more of their cost-savings on to their customers and local communities; because their purpose is maximizing the public good of local constituencies, Community Wireless Networks develop more innovative applications for their users, allowing everyone to become media producers and information disseminators. </p>
<p>There is a substantial global potential to meaningfully affect the lives of countless people and communities. Developing countries that lack the wired infrastructure of last generation communication technologies can jump directly into wireless solutions. Rural areas cut off from urban economic centers can find new avenues for progress and improving quality of life. And the educational opportunities available using these networks will greatly enhance the work of international aid workers and developmental non-governmental organizations. This is a transformative technology; like the Internet itself, the possibilities are limited only by our own imaginations. </p>

<h3 class="title">The Power of All of Us? — The eBay Lesson for Community Development</h3>

<p><strong> Leveraging the Public Good Electronically</strong></p>
<p> Assessing the power-of-all-of-us begins with the fact that one person's ability can be leveraged via the Internet to have a positive impact on thousands of other lives on a scale unprecedented in human history. If all of us were to learn how to leverage our own talents in this way, and to work together, the overall local, national, and global impacts would be tremendous. The true &quot;promise of broadband&quot; is for all eyes and ears to be working together for the common good in order to produce exponentially greater positive outcomes than all-of-us working separately.</p>
<p><strong> Top-Down Control vs. Bottom-Up Innovation</strong></p>
<p> If we truly value American innovation we'd be celebrating our innovators and would be vigorously gathering and sharing innovations broadly. The honest truth is that we tend to shun and ignore innovators both locally and nationally, due primarily to the politics of control. The top-down builders of Internet infrastructure need to partner effectively with the bottom-up intended users of these networks.</p>
<p> There are two recent books out, <em>The Rise of the Creative Class</em> and <em>The Rise of Global Corporate Dominance</em>, that represent the duality of&nbsp;the power of the Internet: the bright promise to liberate the creativity of individuals and their potential global impacts, and the gloomy risk of increasing corporate and governmental domination of the global economy, politics, media, and ultimately our individual lives and life choices. </p>
<p> Inherent in this phrase &ldquo;The Power of All of Us&rdquo; is the echo of democracy and the long-standing question of how best to leverage the public good electronically. There is certainly far greater potential than has yet been demonstrated for <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> or any corporation to serve as a catalyst for global change developing <em>both</em> social and economic value. </p>
<p><strong> A Guide for Web-Based Self-Employment and Community Development</strong></p>
<p> The latest eBay television commercial promotes the theme &ldquo;The Power of All of Us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rapid growth of eBay has definitely raised important questions about how best to leverage &ldquo;The Power of All of Us&rdquo; and eBay has demonstrated a very successful model for entry-level web-based self-employment&mdash;and more. </p>
<p> eBay has demonstrated effective entry-level ecommerce education opportunities with individuals using eBay now numbering 114 million, too many to ignore. There are 430,000 full-time self-employed eBay entrepreneurs, and 150,000 online eBay stores. As one of the fastest growing companies in the world, eBay has expanded into 28 countries and last year exchanged 28 billion dollars. eBay may be a logical first step for entry level ecommerce education, and it has the potential to lead to successively more powerful and inclusive models. As a guide to educating people for web-based self-employment building up from basic eBay skills, see <a href="http://lone-eagles.com/ecom.htm">&ldquo;A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Profiting from the Internet (Rural Ecommerce and Telework Strategies),&rdquo;</a> a non-credit online course sponsored by the Idaho State University College of Technology Workforce Training Office. </p>
<p><strong> Integrating Community Technology Centers and eBay Drop Off Centers</strong></p>
<p> Over 1,000 eBay Drop Off centers have appeared in just the last year, presenting a sustainable community training center model worthy of careful study. Any rural community can pilot a demonstration project whereby an empty storefront on any main street becomes an eBay Drop Off center that also serves as a community e-commerce training center, creating the foundation for expanding local web-based self-employment. By developing for-profit local peer mentoring services, the economy of the entire community can be reversed from serious decline to serving as the new model for rural retail and community self-empowerment.&nbsp; An <a href="http://lone-eagles.com/auctions.htm">&ldquo;Introduction to Online Auctions like eBay&rdquo;</a> provides a useful overview of what can be done, starting with eBay&rsquo;s self-tour, finding best lessons and books, becoming an authorized eBay trainer, determining products and services to market, growing a business, establishing a store and Drop Off Center.</p>
<p> If each American suddenly became aware of a wide range of doable options, and each was given whatever mentoring support was necessary to guide self-directed learning to successive next steps, wide-spread skills transfer within any community can becomes possible even within a three-to-six month timeframe. Not unlike a Kinko&rsquo;s, a community cooperative service center could easily be raising awareness as to how eBay skills can serve as entry-level ecommerce training&mdash;and more.</p>
<p><strong> A Case Study and Other Examples</strong></p>
<p> Donnie Morrison, a grassroots champion of the Outer Hebrides Islands in Northern Scotland, saw dwindling populations in his regional communities. Young people were moving away, schools were losing students, the local economies were dying. Donnie was successful bringing high speed Internet to his communities and high-paying telework jobs, and today the communities are once again healthy and growing. By <a href="http://www.work-global.com/">Donnie's own report</a>, his most successful innovation and key to his success was his creation of a community skills registry database.</p>
<p> While we initially may learn best in a face-to-face setting, the real power for ongoing learning and collaboration is learning to use the online tools which offer convenience and dramatic advantages for gathering and sharing knowledge. Inexpensive open source content management systems (CMSs) can streamline the flow of essential information in communities and serve as the public hub for skills mentoring and the proliferation of fast-track web-based self-employment businesses. Among the many CMS formats, the robust content of the <a href="http://lone-eagles.oldcolo.com/">Lone Eagle Self-Employment Incubator</a> is demonstrated through the photogallery for slideshows of co-op crafters in Idaho, aboriginal artists in Australia, Jamaican visionaries, Alaskan Natives and others. </p>
<p><strong> Producing Fast-Track Exponential Growth with Measurable Benefits </strong></p>
<p> Exponential benefits will be realized as more citizens and communities make their skills available and make their successful innovations known to all. Recognizing the exponential extensibility of impact that one talented individual's collected resources and online self-directed lessons can make will be a revelation on the future potential for scalable benefits as citizen participation increases. As communities of communities naturally evolve for ongoing sharing of new innovations, the benefits to participating communities will also grow exponentially.</p>
<p> <u>S</u>ustainable <u>E</u>commerce <u>E</u>ntrepreneurship <u>D</u>evelopment <u>S</u>trategies (<a href="http://lone-eagles.com/seeds.htm">SEEDS</a>), written with the encouragement of the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/">NTIA/TOP</a> program officers, defines an intergenerational short-term community web-raising initiative. Within a three-six month period the challenge is to create the most significant measurable outcomes possible regarding new skills imparted to a specific number of citizens, new self-employment businesses, new web sites for existing business, and a community co-marketing initiative of all businesses plus a rapidly growing skills registry of the citizen&rsquo;s new skills to be co-marketed regarding telework jobs.</p>

<p>Sharing the grassroots sparks of innovation among rural communities on an ongoing basis is fundamental to fueling the home fires of innovation simultaneously in all rural communities. Several communities simultaneously conducting this &ldquo;process&rdquo; would create a positive competitive &ldquo;Chautauqua&rdquo; spirit with the theme: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Limited Only By Our Imaginations. And Tenacity!&rdquo; </p>
<p>The time has come to acknowledge and share American community technology innovations as if our future depends on it. <br>

<p>Youth Visions Grants, supported by the <a href="http://www.learnandserve.org/">Corporation for National Service's Learn and Serve America</a> program, are designed to give youth and community technology programs the opportunity to use multimedia tools and training to engage in community decision-making to strengthen their neighborhoods. The 2004 Youth Visions grantees conducted workshops in the fall to showcase their multimedia products with their local communities, and to teach other local youth groups how to incorporate community-based curriculum into their programming. More than 150 local organizations participated in these hugely successful events in Austin, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, New York City, Salt Lake City, and Washington, DC. The 2004 grantees are now finished with their projects, and currently are participating in evaluations that will help to better inform next year's programming. </p>

Two of the original sites under the project, the <a href="http://www.alamomha.com/">Alamo Mutual Housing Association</a> and <a href="http://www.madison-park.org/">Madison Park Development Corporation</a>, will receive implementation grants for their projects. CTCNet has developed an initial draft of a Resource Guide to help CTCs through the steps needed to extend their capacity and impact in these areas. In 2005, CTCNet will develop and publish a working draft of guide, and convene a Reflection &amp; Planning Retreat to explore lessons learned in order to strengthen this initiative and plan for a potential new round of grant opportunities. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ilctc.org/">ilCTC</a> is a partnership of community and technology-focused organizations dedicated to bridging the Digital Divide for low-income urban and rural residents throughout Illinois. Its lead members include: <a href="http://www.connectchicago.net/ctcnet.aspx">CTCNet Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.prairienet.org/">Prairienet</a>, the <a href="http://www.itresourcecenter.org/">IT Resource Center</a>, <a href="http://www.siu.edu/">Southern Illinois University at Carbondale</a>, <a href="http://www.eriehouse.org/">Erie Neighborhood House</a>, <a href="http://www.cait.org/default/index.html">Western Illinois Center for the Application of Information Technologies</a>, <a href="http://www.extension.uiuc.edu/">U of IL Extension Services</a>, <a href="http://nicat.ataccess.org/">Northern Illinois Center for Adaptive Technologies</a>, <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/index.html">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, <a href="http://www.uic.edu/index.html/">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>, and <a href="http://www.mtag.org/"> the Midwest Technology Access Group</a>. CTCNet Chicago served as the conference organizer. </p>
<p>This conference was designed to connect people working in community-based organizations in Illinois to a statewide network dedicated to improving the quality of life for people through digital literacy and Internet access programs. </p>
<p>Illinois political leaders participated actively, beginning with the welcome address from keynote speaker Lt. Governor Pat Quinn, who addressed the importance of technology access in urban and rural areas. Our lunchtime speaker, Illinois State Rep. Connie Howard, validated the importance of the work being done by Illinois CTCs to promote digital inclusion throughout the state. Both have invested significant energy and influence in developing funding streams for the work of CTCs. [Editor&rsquo;s note: For previous coverage of IL funding and statewide organizing, see the <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=48">report on the ilCTC initial organizing efforts in the spring of 2003</a>.]</p>

<p>Professional development workshops offered tracks in three crucial areas for CTCs: sustainability, communication and collaboration, featuring sessions highlighing Best Practices in Community Technology for Youth Programs,&nbsp;Workforce Development and Recycling. Participants were able to learn about creative fundraising strategies and grantwriting basics as well as tools and resources to help support their work the through sustainability workshops. The communication workshops, Getting Your News on the Air &amp; Into Print, Telling Your Story with Data, and Getting your Message Out to the Community, provided participants with helpful suggestions on developing the story, documenting success and how to get the message out. The collaboration track provided attendees with examples of successful collaborative experiences in advocacy and how they can work together to expand services and resources, while the Broadband and WiFi workshop provided spirited discussions on last mile/first mile solutions. An evening reception provided plenty of food and networking opportunities for attendees as well as&nbsp;a breathtaking view&nbsp;of Chicago&rsquo;s lakefront.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Day two began with a Funder's panel with representatives from two public funding agencies who provided attendees with insight on what they look for in proposals and how the decision process works. A legislative panel then educated attendees on the importance of working with and educating legislators on their work to help secure resources and influence legislation impacting their programs. Panelists Linda Fowells from the <a href="http://www.cctpg.org/">California Community Technology Policy Group</a>, Ryan Turner from CTCNet National, and Thyatiria Towns from U.S. Representative Bobby Rush&rsquo;s (IL) Technology Taskforce, contributed to helping Illinois centers further develop the work of building the statewide network. </p>

<p> CTCs and libraries share many similarities, and thus the opportunities for collaboration are vast.&nbsp; But when I surveyed Ohio's CTC community, even I was surprised by the breadth and variety of CTC/Library partnerships. From partnering to provide high-speed Internet access to refurbished computers, libraries are natural allies in the community technology movement.&nbsp; Listed here are just a few examples of how CTCs and Libraries can partner to enhance their programs and, hopefully, offer insight and inspiration to other CTCs outside of Ohio.<strong> </strong></p>
<table width="295" border="0" align="left">

<p><strong>Partnering to Provide High-Speed Internet: Southern Perry County </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Holland Center, <a href="http://www.spicyam.org/">SPiCYAM</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.seorf.ohiou.edu/~ag721/">SPICE</a></strong> organizations developed a verbal agreement in 2002 for access to utilize the Perry County District Libraries T1 line. With the assistance of the <a href="http://www.cns.ohiou.edu/">Ohio University CNS (Communications Network Services)</a> department each of the facilities was&nbsp;outfitted with the necessary equipment needed to access the T1. SPiCYAM is located across the street from the Shawnee branch library, which ran cable into their center. The Holland Center and SPICE received service through the Corning branch library, which fed a satellite signal through a bank to the nearby centers. All organizations have&nbsp;indefinite use of the line as long as their&nbsp;purpose for utilization falls&nbsp;within the libraries&rsquo; guidelines such as allowing individuals public access and prohibiting the use of the line for profit. </p>
<p><strong>Partnering to provide innovative programs: Athens </strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.access23.org/">The Appalachian Media Access Center (AMAC)</a></strong> partnered with the local Athens Branch library to develop the &ldquo;Life as a Kid&rdquo; project, a video collaborative that compiled interviews with local residents of all ages relating their experiences as children growing up in Appalachia. The library conceived the project and recruited AMAC to act as a consultant and tech support after being funded through an OCCN grant. The AMAC staff helped children and adults throughout the process learn how to shoot and edit the video footage. They also acted as consultants in the purchasing of the video equipment. </p>
<p><strong> Partnering to provide knowledgeable staff: Cleveland </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://tili.tri-c.edu/about.asp">The Technology and Information Literacy Initiative (TILI)</a></strong> is an innovative program that seamlessly blends technology and technology training, information literacy training, bibliographic instruction, support resources, and other electronic information tools to buttress the learning process. In partnership with the <strong>Cuyahoga Community College (CCC)</strong> library, the TILI program gains support through knowledgeable staff and instructors. Many of the participating CTCs&rsquo; instructors are required to have a Library Sciences degree and teach Information Gathering techniques to the centers&rsquo; students. </p>
<p><strong> Partnering to provide funds and space: Sandusky and Oberlin </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sandusky.lib.oh.us/public/libraryhistory.asp">The Sandusky Library</a></strong> received a $70,000 grant from the Ohio Community Computing Network to equip and operate a community technology center in the new Library. The CTC is called the <strong>Center for Lifelong Learning</strong> and it is located in, and owned and operated by, the Sandusky Library.&nbsp; With a service area population of 50,000 people, about&nbsp;1,400 people visit the library every day.&nbsp; This makes the location of the lab very accessible for the community, and with the library&rsquo;s technology and reference staff here, the patrons have all the help they need to find the information they are seeking. The classroom-style computer lab features 15 computers, and is located in the renovated Erie County Jail portion of the new Library. As part of <em>Clevnet</em>, a consortium of libraries in the northern Ohio area, the Center for Lifelong Learning recently used the lab to conduct training for librarians on the new <a href="http://www.sirsi.com/">SIRSI</a> library services program. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.oberlin.net/~thebridge/">The Bridge</a></strong> in Oberlin has been in partnership with the Public Library since 2000 when it first opened.&nbsp; The library acted as the Bridge&rsquo;s first fiscal agent and handled all of its financial reports and accounting.&nbsp; From the beginning, the library had hoped the Bridge would become an extension of the library, which it did in 2002. All of the Bridge&rsquo;s operational costs are funded&nbsp;through the library&rsquo;s budget, but the center still actively seeks grants for special projects and programs. </p>
<p><strong> Partnering to provide supplementary materials: Zanesville </strong></p>
<p><strong> The James Madison CTC</strong> for Families and Zanesville City Schools have a strong partnership with the public library and the school libraries. The center&rsquo;s clientele frequent the public library for its summer programs and other activities. In return, the public library sends books and computer programs to use at the CTC. The school libraries house the center&rsquo;s computer reading programs. The CTC also just received a 21st Century grant and plans to offer computer programs to enhance learning each morning (CCC Successmaker, Accelerated Reader, Wiggleworks, etc.). The center&rsquo;s adults have also received computer training from the public library. </p>
<p><strong> Partnering to provide the community with refurbished technology: Dayton </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.trcd.org/">The Easter Seals Technology Resource Center</a></strong> , an organization that provides services using assistive technology, has a partnership with the Dayton Local Library, which donates old computers to the center for refurbishment. These newly refurbished computers are then redistributed to special-needs classroom teachers in the local area. </p>
<p><strong> Partnering to share patrons: Scioto County </strong></p>
<p> In addition to the ABLE site located at the <strong><a href="http://www.portsmouth.lib.oh.us/wgorbran.cfm">Lucasville Library Branch</a></strong>, there is a library branch at the <strong><a href="http://www.nwoserrc.k12.oh.us/">Northwest Family Resource Center</a></strong> (home of the Northwest Community Technology Center). Students are asked when they enroll if they currently have a library card.&nbsp; If not, they are directed to obtain one. In return, the library refers patrons to the CTC if the librarian senses a person may have certain needs, such as help with reading. The center also offers early childhood education classes in conjunction with the library's adult workshops.&nbsp; The adults drop off their children at the center before they attend the library's workshop. In addition, the library's service coordinator is a member of the CTC&rsquo;s advisory committee. The library also uses the Northwest CTC for workshops on computer literacy.&nbsp; The CTC also uses the library computers if staff or patrons need to access a site that is blocked on the center&rsquo;s computers. </p>
<p> The early 20th Century British politician Augustine Birrell once said &quot;Libraries are not made; they grow.&quot;&nbsp; By harvesting the resources from these great institutions, community technology programs will begin to grow, not just in size, but in value.&nbsp; These are just a few examples from Ohio; I invite CTCs from around the world to develop relationships with that great hallmark of civilization, the library. </p>

<h3 class="title">CTCNet Delaware Valley/Philadelphia Update</h3>


<p>In Philadelphia, access to and utilization of technology continues to grow as a result of initiatives by the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/">City of Philadelphia</a>, the <a href="http://www.philsch.k12.pa.us/">School District of Philadelphia</a>, <a href="http://www.temple.edu/">Temple University</a>, and <a href="http://www.uwsepa.org/team4tech/index.htm">Teaming for Technology</a>. All four institutions have implemented, or plan to implement, practices by which access to technology will be increased, thus improving the greater Philadelphia community through the innovative utilization of technology. </p>
<p>In September 2004, the City unveiled initial plans to implement a city-wide wireless network, ensuring Internet connectivity for all city residents for free or at a very modest price and transforming the city&rsquo;s 135 square miles into the world&rsquo;s largest wireless Internet &ldquo;hot spot.&rdquo;<a href="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> A small number of cities throughout the United States have already contemplated similar plans; Chaska, Minnesota, a 15 square mile city of 18,000 southwest of Minneapolis, completed installation of a fully-functional wireless network in October 2004 that is available to all residents for a monthly fee of $16.<a href="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></a> Implementation of free or low-cost, city-wide Internet access would make Philadelphia one of the first major cities to offer such a service to its residents. </p>

<p>City officials estimate it will cost approximately $10 million to complete the infrastructure for a city-wide wireless network, and yearly network maintenance fees will total $1.5 million. The plan would involve placing hundreds, possibly thousands, of transmitters on lamp posts throughout the city, allowing any person in the city with a wireless-enabled device to access the Internet. Most standard laptops today now come equipped for wireless Internet access. Once construction of the wireless network is complete, Internet access will be available anywhere radio waves can travel, including low-income neighborhoods where most residents lack access to the Internet. The City hopes to provide wireless Internet for free or low-cost, offering a substantial savings over commercial providers, that on average charge $40 per month for Internet service.</p>
<p>Details of the ambitious project released in October 2004 set summer 2006 as the target date for completion; build-out will begin summer 2005. Wireless access will be free in most outdoor areas; however, the City intends to charge a fee for wireless access inside homes and businesses. No plans have yet been made on how the City will secure funding to complete the estimated $10 million project.<a href="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></a></p>
<p>Philadelphia is also the first city in the United States to offer International Computer Driving License (ICDL) certification, a globally recognized computer certification demonstrating proficiency in fundamental computer applications and IT skills. ICDL instruction covers basic concepts of Information Technology, using the computer and managing files, and word processing, spreadsheet, database, presentation, and information and communication applications. </p>

<p>In addition to the City, the School District has partnered with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> to create the <a href="http://www.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/sof/home.html">School of the Future</a>, a facility fostering the unique fusion of education and technology designed to embrace innovation, technology, and research and development. In November 2004, ground was broken for construction; the model school, costing an estimated $50 million, is expected to open in 2006, enrolling approximately 750 public high school students.<a href="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></a></p>
<p>Temple University, a public research university enrolling more than 34,000 students, recently received an $896,000 ITEST grant from the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>. The <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf04611/nsf04611.htm">Information Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST)</a> grant is designed to increase the opportunities for students and teachers to study, experience, and apply information technology practices in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
<p>Through the ITEST grant, Temple will implement a three-year program designed to develop the Information Technology skills of inner-city youth in North Philadelphia through the development of a community geographic information system (GIS). Begun on September 1, 2004, each year, this project will provide 90 at-risk high school students with Information Technology instruction, spatial analysis, and cartographic and design skills through their involvement in developing and maintaining a community-based GIS. Instruction will be provided in Spanish and English, and students&rsquo; parents and family members will participate in the instructional process. The community GIS education model will be used to map neighborhood and community resources as well as catalogue community technology centers and create an inventory of their resources. Throughout the project, Temple and its <a href="http://www.temple.edu/ece/welcome.htm">Department of Electrical a nd Computer Enginee </a>ring will collaborate with the School District, the Asociacion Puertorriquenos en Marcha Rising Sun Avenue CTC, <a href="http://www.delawarevalley.org">Delawarevalley.org</a>, the Forward and Beyond Program of Harrison Campus Compact, and the <a href="http://www.pacdc.org/">Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations</a>.<a href="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></a></p>
<p>Through a second NSF grant, Temple hopes to establish a community digital library to outreach to adults, nontraditional learners, and underserved communities; develop and enhance their science, math, and technology skills; and improve the quality of life at the community level. </p>
<p>In June 2004, <a href="http://www.uwsepa.org/team4tech">Teaming for Technology (T4T)</a>, an initiative of <a href="http://www.uwsepa.org/">United Way of Southeastern Pennsylvania</a> providing technology to area nonprofits, launched the Internship Program. Through this program, IT students from Philadelphia high schools, community colleges, and vocational and technical schools are placed at non-profits for internships developing their skills in Helpdesk support, networking, programming, web design, databases, and desktop applications. As of November 2004, 27 interns have been placed in internships at 14 different organizations for the 2004-2005 academic year. </p>
<p>In addition to the Internship Program, T4T also operates the <a href="http://www.uwsepa.org/team4tech/community_technology.htm">Digital Inclusion Program</a>, launched in 2003, in partnership with <a href="http://www.one-economy.com/">One Economy Corporation</a>, a national nonprofit based in Washington, DC, and the <a href="http://www.pec-cares.org/">People&rsquo;s Emergency Center (PEC)</a> and <a href="http://www.pcah.org/">AchieveAbility</a>, located in West Philadelphia and serving low-income, formerly homeless single parents and their children. T4T&rsquo;s Digital Inclusion program has brought Internet access to two underserved neighborhoods of West Philadelphia by implementing a wireless network and providing computers to residents in their homes. Through a product grant from Cisco systems, wireless access points were placed throughout the neighborhood, and wireless cards were installed in computers given to each household. Over 200 families in two of Philadelphia&rsquo;s most impoverished neighborhoods now have computers and access to high-speed wireless Internet in their homes. T4T and One Economy&rsquo;s work was featured on the front page of <em>The Washington Post</em> in August 2004.<a href="#6"> <SUP>6</SUP></a></p>
<p>Philadelphia is becoming a technologically-rich society, providing access to technology to many city residents. Both Temple and T4T are bridging the digital divide by offering access to technology and the Internet to at-risk youth in North Philadelphia and low-income communities in West Philadelphia. In the very near future, the City will make the Internet available to all residents of Philadelphia as well as to those who visit, and the School District is turning to technology to provide a distinctive educational program and assist students in discovering their potential Through the diverse ways in which access to technology is provided throughout the city, Philadelphia is becoming a leader in the technology-driven twenty-first century and serves as a model for other cities to learn from. </p>

<p>The New York City office of the national non-profit <a href="http://one-economy.com/">One Economy</a> welcomed its first group of VISTAs in September 2003. I joined Dan Wood, Juliana Schwartz, Kristina Kennedy, and Lamar Howell as enthusiastic advocates of One Economy&rsquo;s mission to increase the presence of information technology in the homes and lives of people in underserved communities. </p>
<p>Our work began with a focus on improving the content of the <a href="http://www.beehivenyc.org/">New York City Beehive</a> (for other local Beehive sites, go to <a href="../WINNT/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/IDHMF6LS/www.beehive.org">www.beehive.org</a> and click the drop-down menu under &ldquo;local&rdquo;), an online resource and information center for New York City residents. The Beehive already provided a wide range of information on important resources from financial and professional matters to immigration and family issues in an easy to read and navigate format, ideal for individuals new to the Web. Some of the challenges the VISTA team faced included expanding on those resources, localizing them to the New York City area, and strategically organizing new material with related topics while keeping within the guidelines of well-written online content. </p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>The late nights and weekend work paid off with over 200 pages of fresh content generated, building on the online resources for Money, Jobs, Schools, Health, and Family. Unlike a &ldquo;Field Of Dreams&rdquo; scenario, however, we learned that building an online information and resource center does not necessarily mean users will come. Understanding this, New York Program Director Kawi Mailutha and the VISTA team set out to develop outreach and projects using the Beehive, through local partnerships and good old-fashioned guerilla outreach tactics and local partnerships.</p>
<p>After a few months, the original OE VISTA &ldquo;Beehive Evangelists&rdquo; team,though decreased by two, began developing new projects in each of the city's five Boroughs, including training sessions for other non-profit staff and. Other efforts included attendance at events where end-users can be reached, such as the Community Food Resource Network&rsquo;s Money Central, where people get help with Earned Income Tax Credit, and the NYC Breastfeeding Promotion Conference.</p>

<p>Led by Carrette Perkins, a VISTA who joined OE in January 2004, a collaborative effort with a Brownsville shelter that transitions families into affordable housing resulted in the transformation of a computer room with one PC running a dial-up Internet connection into a fully networked 15-machine DSL lab&mdash;New York&rsquo;s first fully networked Beehive Resource Center. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Beehive Resource Center,&rdquo; said Carrette, &ldquo;provides a vital resource for shelter residents to connect to many of the services they need such as affordable housing, after school programs, and job information.&rdquo; Especially when catalyzed through training sessions, such as the one offered in April 2004 focusing on the Beehive&rsquo;s Resume Builder and Job Resources.</p>
<p>I led OE&rsquo;s Digital Connectors program in partnership with an organization in Washington Heights. Bringing extensive experience in computer and information technology to the team, Fellow VISTA member Dan Wood and I added a more skill-based training curriculum to the original Digital Connectors model. Each week, the VISTAs spent Monday and Wednesday evenings leading the two-hour Digital Connector sessions with nine students, ages 11 to 16. The program went beyond basic computer training to incorporating hands on workshops, interaction with IT professionals, and field trips to places such as the Sony Wonder Technology Lab. This approach allowed the students to see computers and technology in action and the many ways technology is a part of their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Most of the Digital Connector students don&rsquo;t have access to a PC at home or school, so this curriculum serves to better position them academically and professionally. Students receive a computer when they complete the program. </p>
<p>Holding up the back-end, Dan Wood put serious emphasis on the sustainability of the BeehiveNYC, making sure that every link on every page remains accurate and functional. He piloted a feasible system for updating and maintaining the BeehiveNYC to be in place for the next round of OE VISTAs to implement. Building infrastructure and sustainable programs within organizations are what the AmeriCorps VISTA service year is all about.</p>

<p>Keeping a good program going takes more than money. This article explores the techniques one community technology center, <a href="http://www.fastforwardctc.com/home.html">Fast Forward CTC</a> in Columbia, South Carolina, has employed to ensure the longevity of one after-school program, <a href="http://www2.edc.org/sciencequest/">ScienceQuest</a>.</p>

<p>Too often we are led to believe that sustainability of programs is solely a function of finances. Yet even a well-funded youth program won&rsquo;t produce results if young people don&rsquo;t want to participate and adults in the larger community don&rsquo;t care about its success. At Fast Forward CTC in Columbia, South Carolina, one after-school program, ScienceQuest, has caught on in such a way with both youth and adults that the director, Dee Albritton, was recently prompted to explain, &ldquo;In our case, sustainability isn&rsquo;t about funding, it&rsquo;s about interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fast Forward CTC launched ScienceQuest, a curriculum for teaching hands-on, investigative science to middle schoolers in after-school settings, two summers ago. They started with nine students and four adult coaches who met once a week from September to June. Using a tool called the I-search, they formulated questions, conducted experiments and published their activities on a <a href="http://www.edc.org/sciencequest">website</a>. </p>
<p>The first year was a stunning success. The kids were so enthusiastic about the program that Dee immediately shortened the program to one semester so more youth could participate. The next year 37 kids worked on ten different teams over two semesters with 24 adult coaches. The 2004-2005 sessions promise similar numbers. There is a waiting list to participate. Former participants want to attend again, siblings and classmates want to sign up, and higher income parents are asking if they can pay for their children to attend (youth are chosen based on their need for the program either academically or socially, and on recommendations by teachers). </p>
<p><strong>Factors Contributing to Success </strong></p>
<p>An after-school program must be grounded in the desire to make a difference in the lives of young people. Yet many after-school programs care passionately about young people and still fail. Fast Forward is an example of a successful program due to three interdependent factors: a solid organizational foundation, enthusiastic participants, and invested external stakeholders. A successful program must rest on a healthy foundation&mdash;good leadership, quality curriculum, stable location, and funding. Yet to be <em>sustainable</em>, it needs more. In this case, ScienceQuest draws on two other sources of support: participant enthusiasm and the investment of external stakeholders. Like pipelines of raw fuel, student and community interest provide the energy to propel this program forward. These sources flow when tapped by an able leader with publicity, participation, and interaction. </p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s No Escaping the Need for a Healthy Foundation </strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that Fast Forward is a healthy CTC with a dynamic director&mdash;Dee Albritton received the Toni Stone Innovative Initiative Award from CTCNet and was a winner of the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/stories/v2/15.html">second CTCNet Success Story</a> contest. Fast Forward is several years old and operates in two sites, including the local middle school, which provides space and Internet access in-kind. Its base funding comes from several sources, including the City of Columbia. ScienceQuest is a tested, engaging curriculum. Dee estimates it costs about $15,000 to implement, for program management, a part-time guidance counselor, supplies, t-shirts, snacks and field trips. [ed. note: <em>The ComTechReview</em> has covered both <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=109">ScienceQuest</a> and the <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=108">Fast Forward CTC summer camp</a> previously.]</p>
<p>While Fast Forward is a stable organization, it is not without the challenges of many CTCs. Staff is constantly developing new funding streams, have recently cut programs, and spend much energy maintaining key support relationships. As with any CTC, participant needs often outstrip the time and energy of staff. And there is always uncertainty about where the next funding will come from. </p>
<p><strong>Excited Young People </strong></p>
<p>You can build it, but they may not necessarily come. While ScienceQuest was only launched after the Youth Advisory Board approved it, this was no guarantee other students would want to try it out or stick with it over time. After-school programs increasingly face the dilemma of marketing academic enrichment programs to young people who are deservedly hoping for relief from the structure and pressure of the school day &ndash; this at a time when funders are pushing for just these kinds of programs. </p>
<p>The first challenge was hooking that first batch of students. Fortunately, ScienceQuest is an engaging program driven by student interests. The first teams measured water salinity, played with waves, used a weather station, and created a solar system. They did mock weather reports at the actual WSIS television station in front of the blue screen and saw themselves on the TV monitors. The reputation of ScienceQuest as a fun learning experience was set. And everybody in the Fast Forward world and the Hand Middle School knew it. </p>
<p>Fast Forward&rsquo;s participants are eager spokespeople for the program. Throughout the year, their activities were made public. Kids hanging around after school could watch the experiments happening on the picnic tables outside. Teams were also encouraged to invite other teams over to watch whenever they had something exciting to demonstrate. Dee was encouraging the students to share their natural enthusiasm both within the program and outside of it, such as at the snack time before each meeting. Links were made to the rest of the school as well. Students were invited to demonstrate their experiments for the school&rsquo;s own television show, the Principal&rsquo;s Corner. A policy was instituted where teams could have enough materials to run their experiments an extra time for their science classes. Not least among the strategies, participants were given ScienceQuest t-shirts and were encouraged from the beginning to wear them on ScienceQuest days. As a student at the Hand Middle School, you practically can&rsquo;t <em>not</em> know about ScienceQuest. </p>
<p><strong>Community Support is Key </strong></p>
<p>One nonprofit professional has said, for nonprofits &ldquo;your entire existence depends on the community. If you don&rsquo;t keep your organization vital, a living, breathing organization in the community, it is going to die. You need to get oxygen from the community.&rdquo; Yet very often after-school programs work in isolation from everyone except their participants. When they do interact with the larger community, it&rsquo;s a visit to a museum or public site. In Fast Forward&rsquo;s case, however, the outside world is invited in. </p>
<p>To start with, ScienceQuest <em>requires</em> outside participation in the form of volunteer coaches. This requirement has led to one of the strongest resources for the program. One of the first coaches was Claudia Benitez-Nelson, a professor in marine science at the <a href="http://www.sc.edu/">University of South Carolina</a>. Based on Claudia&rsquo;s positive experience, she recruited graduate students to be coaches and established a way for them to earn credit for volunteering to coach, ensuring a steady supply. Organizing college credit for volunteering was no small feat, but Claudia felt so strongly about the program given her personal experience, she was eager for it to succeed. As many program directors know, having an institutional supply of qualified volunteers is vital; lack of staffing&mdash;even volunteers&mdash;has closed many a good program. It also ensures that even if the program director were to step out of the picture, ScienceQuest would have a much better chance of surviving. </p>
<p>Teachers and parents also provide vital support for the program. These two groups of stakeholders reinforce youth participation and learning. Teachers are asked for recommendations of youth to participate. Kids are encouraged to invite teachers to see their ScienceQuest experiments and to attend celebrations. Dee promotes them wearing their ScienceQuest t-shirts in school, where teachers are sure to see them and ask questions. </p>
<p>Parents, too, are invited to watch experiments and activities, especially as they arrive to pick kids up at the end of the day, since most activities are done out of doors on picnic tables near the place where parents drive up. Parents get the Fast Forward newsletter and are also exposed to the ScienceQuest t-shirts. The buzz from the day&rsquo;s activities spills over to the evening conversations at home. </p>
<p>Finally, Dee takes deliberate steps to involve and inform the larger community. In addition to getting coverage in the local print and TV news, she presents the activities of ScienceQuest quarterly at the City Council and regularly to the school board. She invites other after school programs to visit Fast Forward. While none of these activities provide concrete funding in the moment, each helps establish a stronger presence for the program in the mind of the community. When it does come time to ask for financial support, she can be sure people and organizations are aware of ScienceQuest and its positive effects on young people. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While nothing is certain in the nonprofit or after-school field, Dee Albritton has optimized the potential future of one program, ScienceQuest, at the Fast Forward CTC by setting up and encouraging mechanisms that promote the program&rsquo;s success. At the heart of all this work is passion for improving the lives and prospects of a very particular set of young people. If Dee and her staff, or Dr. Benitez-Nelson and the graduate students didn&rsquo;t care deeply about making a difference for these sixth graders, none of the techniques would matter. But given their care and drive, several factors make it more likely that their efforts will be effective. They start with a healthy foundation: a stable physical location, base funding, a quality program like ScienceQuest and an able leader. Then given initial excitement and enthusiasm, they use every opportunity available to share the excitement of the program with both potential participants and external stakeholders. The result is a program that stands a good chance of existing long enough to provide many dozens of low-income, at-risk youth with exhilarating experiences of science and valuable interactions with caring adults. </p>

<h3 class="title">"Mi Computadora": Improving Computer Use for Non-English Speakers at CTCs</h3>

<style type="text/css">
<!--
.style7 {font-size: x-small}
-->
</style>
<p>Community Technology Centers (CTCs) have played a key role in providing access to technology to the underserved population throughout the United States. The free or low-cost beginner computer classes that CTCs offer, whether at a library, YMCA, or local community center, are often the best opportunity for many low-income Americans to become computer literate (MANA, 1988). Overwhelmingly, the Operating Systems (OS) on computers at CTCs are English language ones. Although Microsoft does offer the Windows OS in many languages, most CTCs do not have the resources to provide them to their program participants. While computer classes may be taught in other languages, the OSs are usually in English (SRI, 2002). </p>
<table width="298" border="0" align="right">

    <td><div align="center" class="style7"><em>Sample desktop configuration. </em></div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><h5>What&rsquo;s the Problema? </h5></p>
<p>When non-English speakers learn computer basics at a CTC on an English OS, there are both language and cultural barriers between them and the computer system (Lonergan, 2000). This article analyzes the problem from a performance-centered design (PCD) perspective, offers some simple remedies to break down these barriers, and aides the beginner to complete important elementary tasks on the computer. PCD takes a human approach to designing technology and strives to provide an &ldquo;optimal environment for decision making and action, where many of the burdens of memory and computation are alleviated&rdquo; (Greenberg and Dickelman, 2000). CTCs may be limited to English OSs, but within this system interface they can add, remove, and/or rearrange existing objects and artifacts to better suit the needs of their participants.</p>
<p><h5> Disorientation </h5></p>
<p>When a non-English speaker turns on a PC with an English OS at a CTC beginner computer class, he or she often sees a desktop with dozens of little images (icons) with small text below them in English. These icons, often referred to as shortcuts, are the first objects, hypertexts, and artifacts that the student encounters. They are most often randomly placed, some are copies of existing ones, and others do not open anything. This problem, which could be called &ldquo;desktop icon overload,&rdquo; often causes disorientation and confusion for the learner. </p>
<p>The performer is typically using the computer system to complete a task. In the case of the beginner computer user, some of the common tasks are: type a document in text editor, play a card game to practice mouse maneuvers, create an email account, use the calculator, and search the Internet. Since the disorganized and disorienting desktop does not help the new user complete a task, he or she must navigate an often long and confusing path to do so. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the task flow of a student who wants to use the calculator on an English OS. The student must find the all-important &quot;Start&quot; button on the bottom left, and then select three more options in order to complete the task by finding the calculator artifact (i.e., Start All Programs; Accessories; Calculator). With little or no English, and the inherent complexity of the Windows navigation, it is very unlikely that the student will be able to complete the task.</p>
<p><h5>Solution </h5></p>
<b>Clean Up Your Desk </b>
<p> According to the principles of PCD, one should match the task process to the learner, and provide the right amount of information at the right time (Dickelman, 1996). When a non-English speaker turns on the computer at a CTC, he or she should have direct access to information and artifacts that she readily understands and that represent the tasks at hand. Translating the language of the desktop icon text is perhaps the most obvious solution, which can be easily done by right clicking on the icon and selecting &ldquo;Rename.&rdquo; Moreover, CTCs should accommodate the user&rsquo;s culture by providing content that is relevant and understandable (Degler and Battle, 2001). </p>
<b>Have Desktop Shortcuts to Appropriate Content</b>
<p>The desktop, therefore, should only have icons that directly link to a program, website, or document that helps the students to complete an essential task. If you work at a CTC, review the icons on your computer desktops. The goal here is to have icons that are appropriate for the learners, taking into account their language and culture. Delete unnecessary icons to remedy any &ldquo;icon overload&rdquo; problems. Then <a href="http://immersion.gmu.edu/portfolios/cbill/ctc.htm">add or create new icons</a> linking to information that is appropriate for and useful to the students. </p>
<h5> Choose Appropriate Programs and Online Content </h5>
<p>The desktop environment is very important because of its prominence, but keep in mind that the icons are just shortcuts to and representations of their respective programs, websites, or other content artifacts. What programs and websites should the desktop icons link to on the computers in your lab? Start by looking at the population that you serve. Ask them about their interests and needs. What tasks do they want to complete, and what information will they need to get it done? What language(s) do they speak and what culture do they most relate to? </p>
<p>For a beginner computer class, you may want to include icons that link to
the following common programs (in the foreign language, if possible): text editor, calculator, and card game (to practice mouse maneuvers), and to the following websites (in that language): email, Internet search, news, and Internet guide/tutorial. See a <a href="http://immersion.gmu.edu/portfolios/cbill/ctc.htm">sample configuration</a> for Spanish speaking beginner computer users. If you have the most recent Windows OS, XP,<strong></strong>at your CTC, you could set up several language environments on one computer. Just create &ldquo;User Accounts&rdquo; for the different languages that you might want (see &ldquo;User Accounts&rdquo; in the Control Panel). </p>
<b> Usability Tests and Implications </b>
<p>Participants in usability tests with the sample Spanish configuration said that &ldquo;it is easier,&rdquo; &ldquo;helps beginners to understand faster,&rdquo; and &ldquo;helps me to understand.&rdquo; As for suggestions, they wanted information about job searching, lawyers, immigration, the library, recipes, and a Spanish dictionary (note: icons could be set up to link to these). Their responses, which were positive overall, suggest that the configuration helped them to complete the task(s) faster and more efficiently, while at the same time providing localized, relevant content. This new OS interface, configured with a few simple changes, helps to counter the four significant content deficiencies of underserved communities: lack of local information, literacy barriers, language barriers, and lack of cultural diversity in Internet material (Lonergan, 2000). </p>
<b>Customization is the Conclusion </b>
<p>Making a few simple changes to the arrangement of the icons and adding a few localized programs, CTCs can create a more useful and friendly environment in which their students can perform more efficiently. They are essentially customizing the computer interface to the needs and interests of their students. For a beginner user, minimizing the desktop icons to a small number that link to key programs and websites in their language creates a simple interface where she can feel comfortable and connected. </p>
<p>The interface should be simple because &ldquo;computers are complex, difficult to learn, difficult to use, difficult to maintain&rdquo; (Norman, 1988). To create a good user experience, it is important that the learner does not have a &ldquo;feeling of puzzlement, nor loss of control&rdquo; (Norman, 1988). The solutions offered in this paper strive to create a simple and understandable environment for non-English speaker on an English OS. There is little to no cost to make these changes to computers, and it can be done on a grass roots level by the CTC center director or class instructor. Perhaps a few intermediate level students could design the environment, using these principles, which new students who speak their language and share their culture might like. </p>

<h3 class="title">Award-winning Homeless Youth Website at Cyber Y Technology Center in San Diego</h3>

<style type="text/css">

</style>
<p> In August 2003 the <a href="http://www.timewarner.com/corp/citizenship/education/">Time Warner Foundation</a> awarded the <a href="http://www.globalschoolnet.org/index.html">Global SchoolNet Foundation (GBF)</a> a grant to work with youth in San Diego, California, focused on a specific challenge that the local community faced. GBF and the <a href="http://yfs.ymca.org/ymcasd_commcoll.htm">Cyber Y Technology Center</a> created a dynamic partnership for the educational outreach project.</p>
<table width="265" border="0" align="left">
  <tr>
    <td width="259"><div align="center"><img src="/winter-2004-2005/img/marcanophoto2.gif" alt="Life on the Streets" width="215" height="209"></div></td>

</table>
<p>When kids heard they had an opportunity to select a problem in their community that needed attention, they decided to make a <a href="http://www.pcd-innovations.com/%20piaug2001/around_the_interface.pdf">website about &ldquo;life on the streets&rdquo;</a> and the matter of being homeless in San Diego. Since some of these kids had been homeless themselves at some time, they knew firsthand many of the barriers homeless youth were facing. </p>
<p> 14 year old Daniel, who attends Monarch High, a school for homeless kids, was chosen as the team leader. &ldquo;The reason I choose this topic is because it sort of hurts me to see my friends on the streets and I can&rsquo;t do anything about it. Nobody really helps the homeless. I want my group project to make a difference after we put this on the web. We want to make a difference in San Diego by cleaning up the streets, and by getting the homeless off the streets.&rdquo; </p>
<p> The kids quickly discovered that there was very little information on the Internet posted by kids about the homeless problem in San Diego, and being at different skill levels in terms of technology, research and writing abilities, they had to overcome many challenges during the creating of their web project. GBF trainers helped the youth understand the many rules and guidelines one must follow when creating a website. They learned how to make their web project interesting, learning along the way what the expression &ldquo;a picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; means, during their quest to gather photos of homeless people in San Diego to help tell their story. </p>
<p> The students were further educated on the use of the web as a tool for sharing and researching important issues. During the creation of the site, those who were better at a certain tasks taught those who were less skilled. &ldquo;We are now better web authors and storytellers. Our writing and research skills have improved from this project. It&rsquo;s fun to be able to create our own content,&rdquo; said Justin, age 13. </p>
<p> As a result of the project, the youth improved many social skills such as cooperation, collaboration, teamwork, compromising and balance. According to Rodney, age 11, &ldquo;Our participation in the &lsquo;Youth Awareness Ambassador Project&rsquo; has given us the chance to share our stories, drawings, and photos with the world. We realize that it is also important to be spokespersons for our project, so we will continue to be &lsquo;youth awareness ambassadors&rsquo; by making presentations around town. We hope that our local new media work with us to tell our story, so we can help solve the problem of homeless kids.&rdquo; </p>
<p> These kids also learned that the value of a project increases when visitors can contribute, so they have made their web site interactive and encouraged others to share their stories and images. &ldquo;We learned that kids can help their community. We learned to become &lsquo;youth awareness ambassadors,&rsquo; by using our own experiences to bring attention to the problems that homeless kids face. We think our web site will make a positive impact on our community, as well as the rest of the world, by helping others understand that many people, especially kids, become homeless through no fault of their own,&rdquo; says Riley, age 11. </p>
<p> Today, the website has been visited by thousands of people. Students as well as teachers across the nation have found the website inspiring. &ldquo;<em>Congratulations for creating and sharing this beautiful website. It has inspired me to find out more about homeless youth and ways I can help and support them</em>,&rdquo; said Alexis, a local community member who provided feedback through the site. A teacher in Ohio considered the <a href="http://globalschoolnet.org/programs/lifeonthestreets/Misconceptions.htm">&ldquo;Misconceptions&rdquo; page</a> thought-provoking and shared with her students how kids can engage in civic activities in their own communities. Another teacher in Massachusetts was so shocked and disturbed after visiting the site that it inspired her to use our example to create similar projects at her school. Mandi, a student from Ohio, congratulated the kids for helping in the fight against homelessness. We have also received requests from around the world to use our photos to demonstrate how technology is being used by youth.</p>

<p>The kids have also received recognition and support by the local media and community.

They are the youngest recipients ever to receive the prestigious award. Unfortunately, Daniel, Justin, and Jordan could not make it to the presentation of the award. They couldn&rsquo;t escape the cause they were fighting. They became homeless themselves this past summer and had to relocate to Fresno.

<h3 class="title">FY 2005 Federal Community Technology Appropriations</h3>

<p>CTCNet has actively monitored the funding outlook for federal investments in community technology for the year ahead. 2005 will present a mixture of challenges and opportunities for the community technology field. Congress recently passed a spending package that not only included a large number of cuts for important programs, such as the federal Community Technology Centers program, but also the stunning elimination of the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/">Technology Opportunities Program (TOP)</a>. That said, a number of other areas, including the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/21stcclc/index.html">21st Century Learning Centers </a> program and the <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/nnw/nnwindex.cfm">Neighborhood Networks </a> initiative received continued or increased funding. <br>
  <br>
  The overall picture suggests that in light of a daunting economic picture, including the erosion of new federal dollars for programs of interest and continued shortfalls at the state level, community technology interests must focus attention on previously untapped or underutilized programs, including those emphasizing the implementation of effective program models, instead of purely demonstration grant activities. Additionally, resources that encourage collaboration and partnership across disciplines will <br>
  increasingly shape the federal funding picture for the field. </p>

<h3 class="title">Community Networking after TOP: Progressive Alliances and a State-by-State Strategy</h3>

    <td><div align="center"><a href="http://www.afcn.org"><img src="/winter-2004-2005/img/afcn_logo.gif" alt="AFCN logo" width="160" height="160" border="0"></a></div></td>

<p>The news of one November morning as I began my notes for the CTR wasn't good: the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/top/">Technology Opportunities Program </a> at the <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/">U.S. Department of Commerce </a> — known to one and all as “TOP” — had been cut from the Federal budget. This was fairly surprising to those of us freshly reinvigorated by the optimism and energy at the <a href="http://www.ruraltelecon.org/">Rural Telecommunications Congress in Spokane</a>, but perhaps hardly on anyone else's radar. In recent years we've come to expect a call to rally support for this program to keep it in the budget. And after all, why wouldn't we? TOP has long been dear to the Community Networking crowd, funding projects at the crossroads between social and technological innovation, where we in the community networking sector have always stood, ringing our bell.</p>
<p><strong>Is It News That We're Not Newsworthy?</strong></p>
<p>The importance of the humanist impulse in promoting equitable access to technology and of our particular tech-evangelical strain that has seen the dramatic ongoing social change that would result from continued investment are lost on the mass media. It's been said we don't have a constituency. Haven't we been infectious enough with our optimism or the strength of our techno-populist convictions? Clearly not: we settle for what we get, and we continue to get less than we need. We shouldn't fall into the trap of defending our fiefdoms, content that our own program still has funding. Our situation requires an expansive vision and an explicit connection to the deeper traditions of Progressivism. </p>
<p><strong>What Has Been The Impact Of TOP and What Will Be Its Legacy?</strong></p>
<p>Before TOP was defenestrated (as my Canadian friend so aptly put it) <a href="http://www.afcn.org/">AFCN </a> leadership was asking: what can we do for TOP? It's not that we expected a fight this year. More to the point, we realized the historic vulnerability of the program was that its impact and potential hadn't been well understood or articulated. There was already a record of 610 grantees over ten years. They sound official, but these figures aren't the legacy; neither are dollars spent or dollars leveraged. In theory this was always intended as an investment in our digital future and not as triage for the digital divide. TOP was the federally funded R&amp;D wing of our sector. The extent to which our investment will pay dividends to we who stand in the crossroads depends on what we do next.</p>
<p>There is still time to do what we should have been doing all along: learn lessons from the experience and disseminate those lessons widely. This is much more than honoring the memory of a dear friend. We have the opportunity to deepen her legacy and fight for her functional successor. We need to make the case for TOP in a <em>post mortem </em> that sparks the fabled bird from the ashes. This isn't a look-back at past glories of community Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). TOP's impact isn't over if we remain committed to the principle that the money that went out the door wasn't a subsidy but an investment. We've got 610 models to analyze and build upon. <em>Ready to roll up your sleeves?</em></p>
<p>And this impact has been far deeper than the lessons learned from the funded programs. Seeking a multi-year federal grant with matching funds is a process where one can't help but build relationships and requires an investment of significant resources, and not a little thinking. We'd do as well to study the many nearly-funded programs and the range of partnerships built on hopes of winning this <em>palm d'or</em>. It looks like there's more than enough work to go around.</p>
<p>So, as the program shuts down, can we mobilize a concerted effort to parse these lessons and promote them widely? This would establish the case for a successor to TOP. And there is perhaps something to learn from the TOP experience beyond the achievements of the funded and proposed projects. We should be able to assert our case for a stronger R&amp;D strategy: explicit plans and support for dissemination; conscious preference for projects attempting more holistic solutions to our complex social problems; second stage programs to support the extension and replication of the flagship models here and abroad.</p>
<p>These elements set the stage for the organizer's challenge: <em>what is an ICT policy worth fighting for? </em>We need to get our movement coordinated and on message. <a href="http://rockridgeinstitute.org/people/lakoff">George Lakoff's commentary on the state of Progressivism in America </a> hasn't gone unheard. </p>
<p>(Consider Lakoff's recent book <em><a href="http://rockridgeinstitute.org/bookstore/elephant/view">Don't Think of an Elephant </a></em> a primer.) The language of the community technology sector is cumbersome. Outside of our field, who knows what we are talking about? Coordinating our message for the broader purposes of the movement rather than for our organizations will take a lot of work. Are we ready to work together and to invest in articulating an ambitious vision for community ICT? We'd better buy in. This was our investment to begin with, and it is our own legacy to squander or redeem. </p>
<p>This is why we sound our bell. <em>We hope it resonates.</em></p>
<p><strong>Modeling a Collaborative Open Community ICT Policy Initiative</strong></p>
<p>We don't just see a divide. We see solutions to social problems. The challenges of the day aren't so much technical as they are social and organizational. What is technologically possible boggles the mind. Yet there is something that hasn't been communicated. Innovation for the benefit of community ICT is being restrained, community efforts are being starved. There are two dimensions to this: information access and overload, and the egregious behaviors of a certain breed of “business.”</p>
<p><strong>57 Channels And Nothing's On</strong>; <strong>610 Projects And How Many Spin-offs?</strong></p>
<p>We've invested in a fund of knowledge, but not in its dissemination or interpretation. As one Lone Eagle puts it, “How many County Commissioners will dig through more than 600 one-problem one-solution programs?” Where would a community leader begin?</p>
<p><a href="http://ntiaotiant2.ntia.doc.gov/top/index.cfm">TOP maintains a searchable database </a><a name="OLE_LINK1">– we understand this will be maintained somewhere if not at the Department of Commerce. It's a starting point </a>but there isn't a single repository of knowledge that's easily navigable and functioning as a <em>sustained collaborative community effort </em>. The brain-trust of our field needs to get to work—in a different way. We should create frameworks in which we can work without concern for turf and organizational identity. The AFCN is working closely with our comrades in arms, the <a href="http://ruraltelecon.org/dp/">Rural Telecommunications Congress (RTC)</a>, the <a href="http://www.comm-dev.org/">Community Development Society </a>, the <a href="http://www.ciresearch.net/">Community Informatics Research Network</a>, and others to strengthen our relevance at multiple levels of practice.</p>
<p>As we seek to be of greater relevance to local practice it becomes obvious that we need to provide support that extends beyond dissemination of models to comparative policy. Each community is caught in the drama of its own local politics and the waves of hierarchical and tangled jurisdictions (i.e., the drama of political efforts they have little influence upon).</p>
<p><strong>Policy and That Most Peculiar Breed of Business: The ICT Firms</strong></p>
<p>Discourse can get drowned out by the sound of dollars. There's a fight going on. We know the 800 pound gorillas are in our municipalities and legislatures, in the halls of Congress, and in the Courts. We've been suffering in the house of the dysfunctional children of the old Bell system and their Cable cousins. Each state has become a battleground as communities lose longstanding rights. It's not so much a quest for deregulation as it's re-regulation to the advantage of incumbent providers. If we argue against business in the language of business, it appears we lose. However, <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blogs/cooper">Mark Cooper </a> offers a compelling case that we can and should take up the language and tradition of commerce and the common law without trepidation (<a href="http://www.afcn.org/node/view/141">“Open Architecture as Communications Policy”</a>). Commerce involves communication and transport and, when carried on without discrimination, brings development and freedom. Certain clear principles such as common carriage were established through arduous struggle over our history and embodied in the common law and are applicable equally to Rail, Telephony and the Internet.</p>
<p>In addition to the convergence of media technologies, the decades since the dissolution of Ma Bell have seen a concerted and increasingly emboldened effort to undermine these principles. The restoration of our modern birthright requires our advocacy of Progressive Democratic Capitalism as foundational to our liberty; we must strive to clarify for the public good the peculiarities that set ICT firms apart in the field of commerce. The issue of the ICT firms must be dealt with in a historical and comparative context for leaders to have any chance of establishing the policies we hope for. </p>
<p><strong>Let's Take It State-By-State</strong></p>
<p>Back to our local community leader or state policy maker: Where should they go to gain perspective on what works or what has been tried? Even practitioners in our field may not know of significant relevant projects just over the border… any border.</p>
<p>There are resources, to be sure, and many are rather comprehensive and ambitious in scope. Of course, none live up to the fantasy that pervades the minds of researchers and practitioners of every stripe: the up-to-date repository of all knowledge and projects relevant to whatever you happen to be working on. Only in the Internet Age have we come to expect it but remained fairly disappointed.</p>
<p>The challenge is as much one of organizing knowledge work as it is of organizing information. In order to address this need for a repository for shared knowledge in our field and a comparative framework for Community ICT vision, we require a sustained and coordinated effort. This differs substantially from existing efforts, though it is in large measure inspired by them. Among the most respected is the <a href="http://www.techpolicybank.org/">Techpolicybank </a> of <a href="http://www.childrenspartnership.org/">The Children's Partnership</a>. And <em>a propos </em> of the TOP discussion, their database remains available. In general, the theme of viewing the states as policy laboratories is gaining prominence. The <a href="http://www.apt.org/">Alliance for Public Technology </a> provides <a href="http://apt.org/publica/lab/">state-by-state community broadband resources </a> and the Rural Technology Congress conference in Kentucky in the Fall of 2005 will be themed “States as Broadband Laboratories.”</p>
<p>We can build upon these resources and initiatives through an open collaborative framework. With an open framework for coordinating the knowledge-work of our field we can better advance a sound policy and practice agenda for ICT, and we can better sustain the effort. A <em>sourceforge </em> for community ICT policy would tap the energy of the many communities and concerned individuals eager to advance the cause and would get beyond institutional and organizational boundaries and allegiances that hamper the growth of the commons.</p>
<p>We propose an open project to catalogue and compare state level ICT policies and initiatives, and we invite your support in carrying out this enterprise. This project should encompass more than broadband infrastructure deployment policies. We've established a neutral space on the <a href="http://www.omidyar.net/">Omidyar Network </a> for discussion outside of the usual institutional boundaries. Check out the <a href="http://www.omidyar.net/group/state-by-state/">State-by-State ICT Policy and Practice Project</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Signal from the Community Wireless Movement </strong></p>
<p>When will issues of right-of-way, easements and spectrum be of concern to a wider community or at least the leadership of the Community ICT sector?</p>
<p>If I've ever seen an assembly of the shock troops of talent in the ICT movement, it was at the <a href="http://www.communitywirelesssummit.org/">National Summit for Community Wireless Networking </a> in Champaign Urbana last August. Wireless Community Networking, Open Mesh Networks, Intelligent Spectrum devices…these aren't just cutting edge technologies, the domain of the alpha geeks. These are social technologies at the leading edge of our fight for progressive democratic capitalism.</p>
<p>And these aren't the alpha geeks of old. They're activist-geeks and they've taken the battle to communities, schools, and libraries. They are fighting in the courts and in the legislatures and in testimony before the great Trade and Communications Commissars in the beltway. They are fighting through community and independent media for local media access and empowerment, developing and disseminating tools and resources along the way. That's what it means to fight for something and not just against something.</p>
<p>How can we support their efforts? </p>

<p>Since its inception the Internet has been touted as having revolutionary potential for democratic communication. Although other media including television and radio have not lived up to their democratic potential, it is too early to dismiss the Internet as being merely a tool for the powerful. Certainly civil society has been extraordinarily creative in using the Internet for positive social change over the past few years. Although a very large number of communication venues exist in cyberspace, one critical function – deliberation – has been largely ignored. The need for computer support for online deliberation can be shown by the fact that many online discussions seem to have no resolution at all. Some seem to sow more confusion while others degenerate into &quot;flame wars&quot; that make it difficult for anybody to get any work done.</p>
<p>Motivated by a desire to help make online discussions more productive— particularly among civil society groups who are striving to create more &quot;civic intelligence&quot; in our society—Nathan Clinton and Doug Schuler of <a href="http://trout.cpsr.org/program/sphere/">CPSR's Public Sphere Project </a> have developed e-Liberate, an online tool for group deliberation based on Roberts Rules of Order. Roberts Rules of Order was developed by Henry Robert in the late 1800s to provide an orderly process for people meeting together face-to-face to make decisions fairly. Robert labored over his &quot;rules&quot; for thirty years and they are now in daily use by tens of thousands of deliberative bodies worldwide. One of the interesting things that we have learned about Roberts Rules is that the process seems to scale up: small groups of five or so can use Roberts Rules of Order – as can groups numbering in the hundreds. We of course hope that e-Liberate will prove as versatile. E-Liberate is intended to be easy to use. It employs a straightforward user interface which is educational as well as facilitative. The interface shows, for example, only the legal actions that are available to the user at that specific time in the meeting. (A user can't second a motion when there is no motion to second!) At any time an &quot;about&quot; button can be clicked to explain what each particular action will accomplish thus providing useful cues that aren't available in face-to-face meetings, one of the things that can be seen in the <a href="http://clients.rocket51.com/e-Liberate/demo.php">transcript of a sample session</a>.</p>
<p>We at CPSR's Public Sphere Project are now beginning to work with groups who would like to use e-Liberate for actual meetings. Although we believe that face-to-face meetings are very important, it is our hope that non-profit groups will use e-Liberate to save time and money on travel and use the resources they save on other activities that promote their core objectives. We are enthusiastic about the system but we are well aware that the system as it stands may have problems that need fixing. For that reason we plan to host a small number of meetings over the next few months and gather feedback from attendees. If you are a member of an organization that uses Roberts Rules of Order to conduct meetings and you'd like to try e-Liberate for a &quot;real meeting,&quot; please be encouraged to <a href="http://trout.cpsr.org/program/sphere/e-liberate/pre-register.php">pre-register</a>.</p>
<p>Although it is our intent to make e-Liberate easy to use, some knowledge of—and experience with—Roberts Rules of Order is critical to successful participation in e-Liberate meetings. Groups intending to use e-Liberate should work to ensure that all meeting attendees have basic understanding of the various motions and the basic rules; we have developed an online manual for that purpose. Additionally, the meeting chair should be prepared to assist attendees whenever possible. Finally, the developers will also be available to assist even though everybody currently working on this project is volunteering their time.</p>
<p>The system in its current form can support meetings that take place in real-time over an hour or so and, also, meetings that stretch out over days or even weeks. Over the next several months we hope to study a variety of online meetings in order to adjust the system and to develop heuristics for the use of the system. After this trial period we plan to make e-Liberate freely available for online meetings and to release the software under a free software license.</p>
<p>We hope that e-Liberate will help you and your organization as you strive to build a better tomorrow. The Public Sphere Project is dedicated to developing information and communication systems that help people deal with social and environmental problems. We welcome your questions, concerns and ideas related to the Public Sphere Project and the e-Liberate deliberation system. </p>

<p>On the corner of 111th Street and 5th Avenue, two young men with corn rolls and baggy pants spent their summer working side-by-side to make ends meet and were never questioned by the police patrolling the area.</p>
<p>Shem Rajoon and Muoyo Okome are web designers who combined their Dreamweaver, Flash and Adobe Photoshop skills to create <a href="http://www.playing2win.org/">Playing2Win </a>'s website. Okome was responsible for the programming and Rajoon focused on graphic design. The two master minds work hand in hand when it comes to designing web sites but they both will be the first to tell you that it has taken years of practice to develop marketable skills.</p>

<p>Okome is completing his senior year in <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>'s <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Computer Science Department </a> and learned about P2W's internship opportunities through a job training program at school. “I chose Playing2Win because I knew that I could exercise my skills in a comfortable environment,” said Okome. The Brooklyn native took computer science classes in high school and found a love for technology. “I always wanted to lean how to design my own video game,” he said. When Okome graduates from Princeton next year he plans to start his own software and web development business.</p>

<p>Rajoon, on the other hand, comes to P2W from another community based organization called <a href="http://www.harlemlive.org/">Harlemlive</a>, an online teen publication run by inner city youth, where he acquired most of his skills. Rajoon was 11 years old when he discovered his love for technology and explained that he started out with photography. “I learned how to edit photos using Adobe Photoshop and it took off from there,” he said. Rajoon's motivation comes from his hunger for success. As a young boy, Rajoon never thought that technology would have any significance in his life but in 1997 that all changed when he met the Harlemlive founder Richard Calton, who took him in and showed him how fascinating technology can really be. It didn't take long for Rajoon to realize that technology touches all aspects of life. “I would encourage other young adults to try it out before completely disregarding it,” he said.</p>
<p>The teenage wonder made it very clear that community technology centers (CTCs) are essential in low-social economic areas because they give young adults a reason to stay off the streets. Rajoon has worked on a number of different web sites such as WNET's <a href="http://www.thirteen.org/">www.thirteen org </a> and <a href="http://www.boysandgirlsharbor.net/">New York's Boys &amp; Girls Harbor</a>. Rajoon also works for <a href="http://www.hl-designs.com/">HL Designs</a>, a company created by Harlemlive.</p>
<p>Rajoon also feels organizations like Harlemlive and P2W are more resourceful than the public school system because of the freedom to explore different technological advances at your own pace. “In school there are too many time constraints and curriculum limitations,” he said. </p>
<p>However, there are disadvantages when it comes to a CTC. “They don't have enough financial support and they don't get enough publicity so people don't know about them,” said Rajoon. Although Rajoon spends most of his time designing web sites he still finds time to play the latest video games on his Playstation 2 and X-box systems. Five years from now Rajoon can see himself running his own web development business somewhere in Harlem.</p>
<p>Although Rajoon and Okome have big plans for the future they will always conduct business with community technology centers like P2W. The future looks very bright for these young men who have managed to remain focused in a very difficult field; distractions come in and out of their lives and so far they have done a phenomenal job of beating stereotypes to become productive young men. </p>

<h3 class="title">The Community Technology Empowerment Project: Technology Literacy in the Twin Cities</h3>

<table width="263" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" align="left">
  <tr>
    <td width="246"><div align="center"><a href="http://www.technologypower.org"><img src="/winter-2004-2005/img/drewyorphoto1.gif" alt="CTEP logo" width="231" height="185" border="0"></a></div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Community Technology Centers have teamed up with 17 AmeriCorps members in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to increase technology literacy within the new <a href="http://www.technologypower.org/">Community Technology Empowerment Program (CTEP)</a>. CTEP is the result of five years of work by the regional consortia of CTCs in the Twin Cities area, C-CAN, to help CTCs increase technology access and programming for new immigrants and low-income residents.</p>
<p>The Twin Cities area has seen an increased need for technology access and literacy programs due to an influx of new immigrant residents. The 2000 Census showed, for instance, an increase of 166% of the Latino population and of 108% of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) population. Many new immigrants and minorities live in federally designated “Empowerment Zones,” under HUD's community revitalization program. These areas of the cities have the largest number of minorities and non-English speakers, and the highest percentage of poverty and unemployment in the state. </p>
<p>New immigrants often need immediate access to basic resources such as health care, housing, social services, and human rights and educational resources , but run into barriers to finding and using these community services due to economic, linguistic, and cultural differences. In addition, as many neighborhood organizations and CTCs are under-funded, there are significant gaps in developing sustainable technology programs in “Empowerment Zone” communities to provide training and improve immigrant economic conditions. CTEP AmeriCorps members are helping CTCs support these new residents using technology tools that already exist in many communities.</p>
<p>AmeriCorps CTEP members begin by broadly and thoroughly assessing and evaluating their CTC's technological capacity. Members have spent their first few months gathering information about their host site CTC and surrounding communities and will now be helping their sites develop strategic plans to improve CTC outreach programs. Members also support staff in serving neighborhood youth and adults through new programming, including multimedia projects. In addition, members promote understanding of existing technology tools and resources, and train and manage CTC volunteers, connecting them to service activities in their communities.</p>

<p>“CTEP AmeriCorps members will be doing various capacity building projects at their host sites. One major focus for members is increasing volunteerism because many non-profits rely on volunteers to deliver services to communities. Another is the assessment on the technology capacity of the organization. This report doesn't focus on technology, as much as how the organization increases technology literacy for community members. It will allow an organization to make informed decisions about its technology facilities and education,” said CTEP director Jeff Streier.</p>
<p>Members receive ongoing training and professional development that will ultimately allow them to train others. Some will develop culturally and linguistically appropriate websites and public service announcements in Hmong (for a special minority group from Laos), Vietnamese, Khmer (for native Cambodian speakers), Spanish, and Somali focused on health care, housing, social services, and human rights and educational resources. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights member is working on recruitment of translators for MDHR's website to be translated into Hmong, Spanish, and Somali and to increase access to this information. Members will focus on developing media like this to help immigrants and low-income residents tune in to community resources.</p>
<p>“Several of our members will be able to infuse the first language of immigrants with technology training. One example is a computer basics class in Hmong or Somali. Or how about the other way around—ESL classes that use technology to learn English? There will certainly be technology learning going on there,” Streier said.</p>
<p>Having an AmeriCorps member on-site at a CTC frees up staff from what they may not have the time or skills to implement alone. Since each organization is unique, there will be collaboration for resource use and development. Members will learn to teach so that they can bring back sustainability to their specific site and its community, as well as the greater Minneapolis/St. Paul area. Unanticipated collaborations seem a given for the members, as they took time at their first orientation on October 19, 2004 to talk about how they could share their skills and interests.</p>
<p>CTEP AmeriCorps member Mustafa Ali was enthusiastic about sharing his skills. “I know Somali. I can help you translate,” he said to fellow member Linda Shoemaker. “Human rights information is needed in the Somali language.”</p>
<p>CTEP is administered by <a href="http://www.serveminnesota.org/">ServeMinnesota-the Minnesota Commission on National and Community Service</a>. </p>

<h3 class="title">How Wi-Fi Came to El Chaco in the Ecuadorian Rainforest</h3>

What happens in the following story is nothing out of the ordinary; it is just 
how Wi-Fi came to the community of El Chaco in Ecuador.<br>
<table border="0" align="left" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">

El Chaco is a small town about two hours by car east of Quito on the edge of 
  the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest. Its 6,ooo inhabitants earn a living mostly 
  from agriculture or small businesses when they have not left to seek their fortune 
  in Quito or in other countries. El Chaco is neither rich nor poor — nobody is 
  starving and nobody has riches. The people of El Chaco have learned to make 
  do with the basics. The same is true for the town's infrastructure: El Chaco 
  has schools but they are in a bad state; El Chaco has a health station but no 
  hospital and a doctor is often hard to find; El Chaco has access to the phone 
  but the lines are rare and calls expensive; El Chaco has roads, some good, mostly 
  bad, sometimes impassable.
  <p>The only special features that El Chaco has to offer, besides the outstanding 
  natural beauty that so often can be found in Ecuador, is that an oil pipeline 
  is running straight through it and that the river nearby is a paradise for all 
  kinds of water sports like rafting and kayaking, ranking as one of the best 
  in the world. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.chasquinet.org">Fundacion Chasquinet</a> is a small NGO 
  based in Quito. The work Chasquinet does can be simply described as supporting 
  the strategic use of the available information and communication technologies 
  (ICT) in the social sector, working on a national and international basis with 
  telecenters, schools, hospitals and NGO's. Chasquinet has established over the 
  years an &quot;open door&quot; policy, meaning that Chasquinet will not go into 
  the communities and establish its own projects but waits until the communities 
  come to Chasquinet and ask for support. In this way it is ensured that the work 
  Chasquinet is doing is based on the real needs of the communities and not the 
  needs perceived by Chasquinet for a community. Chasquinet enters a partnership 
  with the communities and the goal of these partnerships is community development. 
</p>
<p>In 2003 the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/">Canadian International Development 
  Research Center (IDRC)</a> and the <a href="http://www.icamericas.net/">Institute 
  for Connectivity in the Americas (ICA)</a> contacted Chasquinet asking if Chasquinet 
  would be able and willing to pilot Wi-Fi equipment in Ecuador. The equipment 
  was from the Canadian company <a href="http://www.eion.com/">EION</a> and consisted 
  of three Wi-Fi sets with surround coverage of 5 km with one set having an additional 
  25 km point to point connection. </p>
<p>At the same time the community of El Chaco contacted Chasquinet asking them 
  not only to help with their connectivity problem but also to help to make this 
  work for the social and economic development of the whole community.</p>
<p>El Chaco had already experience with the Internet connection, consisting of 
  a single computer at a restaurant. The connection was expensive and slow but 
  it had convinced many in El Chaco of the potential of the new ICT's and the 
  first question the community was looking for answers to was: How can we connect 
  El Chaco to the Internet in a cost efficient way?</p>
<p>What better place then to test the Wi-Fi equipment than El Chaco? However, 
  installing the equipment is just a small part of a successful project, and the 
  most important question that needed answering was: Connectivity for what?</p>
<p>A series of community meetings was called and the questions the people of El 
  Chaco wanted to answer soon became clear: How can the Internet help us in our 
  schools, in our local government, with the small and medium enterprises, with 
  the ecology, the health services and tourism? How can we make it sustainable 
  not only in a financial but also in a technical, social, cultural and political 
  sense? </p>
<p>To find the answers to these questions and to develop a strategic plan for 
  the implementation of the new information and communication technologies, Chasquinet 
  undertook a number of training and planning workshops. The training did not 
  just concentrate on the technical aspects of using computers. More important 
  was the training on the strategic use of these technologies: how to use the 
  Internet in schools, how could the local government take advantage, how to document 
  and protect the environmental treasures, how could the local enterprises be 
  supported, how could the local health station use it, and how could the Internet 
  be used to organize and promote local tourism?</p>
<table border="0" align="right" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">

One lesson Chasquinet has learned in the years of its existence is that social 
  transformation can only come through personal transformation so in addition 
  to the more Internet-concentrated workshops a &quot;Healing Touch&quot; workshop 
  was organized for the community. Healing Touch is a medical technique that combines 
  traditional indigenous healing traditions from North and South America, and 
  it proved to be a vital step in the sustainable community development of El 
  Chaco as it responded to deeply-rooted medical and cultural needs of the community. 
</p>
<p>After six month of training and consultations the community came up with their 
  plan to implement the Internet in El Chaco. The main points of this plan were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a Community Telecenter at a community center managed by a local 
  group.</li>
<li>In a first phase, only the Telecenter, the local Government and the Health 
  Center would be connected via Wi-Fi to the Internet.</li>
<li>The Telecenter would offer not just connectivity services to the community 
  but concentrate on offering training particular to teachers and pupils, local 
  government officials and local businesses.</li>
<li>Further points (schools, hotels, businesses, police station and so on) would 
  be connected to the Wi-Fi network only after the respective users had received 
  training at the Telecenter.</li></ul>

</table>
The plan was immediately put into action. The Telecenter was created and the 
  workshops started and soon the Telecenter was a focal point of the community. 
  But there was still one problem; it was a telecenter without Tele, without any 
  Internet connection. Even if the Wi-Fi would be installed now it needed to be 
  connected to the Internet. Dial-up and any cable based solution were out of 
  the question due to their high costs. A technical investigation was undertaken 
  with the result that a combination between VSAT and Wi-Fi would be the best 
  and most cost effective solution, but the initial costs and the running costs 
  were still high. A solution was found when the local government and the semi-governmental 
  development agency for the Ecuadorian Amazon region, ECORAI, decided to share 
  the cost. </p>

  </table>
<p>The installation of the EION Wi-Fi equipment turned out to be easier then first 
  thought. Everybody involved was nervous to see if this new technology would 
  do what it promised, but after just a day and a half of installation the Wi-Fi 
  worked just fine. Throughout the installation local technicians from the telecenter 
  took part in order to learn how the system worked, to enable them to maintain 
  it in the future and to act as &quot;experts&quot; for further installations. 
  El Chaco was now on the Net and even with only three initial connection points 
  the impact could be felt immediately.</p>
<p>For the first time teachers and pupils had access to quality teaching materials, 
  for the first time families could communicate at a low cost with their loved 
  ones working abroad, for the first time the mayor and his staff could access 
  relevant governmental resources, for the first time the nurse could get advice 
  from doctors in Quito, for the first time traders could offer their goods outside 
  the local market, just a few examples from many. As one local woman expressed 
  it: &quot;I feel like El Chaco is for the first time on the map.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a perfect example how a relatively simple and cheap project like the 
  Wi-Fi in El Chaco can have a big impact.</p>
<p>The main lessons learned from the project are: Wi-Fi, particularly in combination 
  with VSAT technology, can be a cost-effective way to connect rural communities, 
  but this connectivity will only have an impact if the system is implemented 
  by the respective community and used by them according to their needs. Training, 
  strategic use and community involvement are more important than the technology 
  itself.</p>
