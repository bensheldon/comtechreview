<div class="category_title">How Wi-Fi Came to El Chaco in the Ecuadorian Rainforest</div> <span class="posted">by Klaus Stoll</span>




<p>What happens in the following story is nothing out of the ordinary; it is just 
how Wi-Fi came to the community of El Chaco in Ecuador.</p>

<p>El Chaco is a small town about two hours by car east of Quito on the edge of 
  the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest. Its 6,ooo inhabitants earn a living mostly 
  from agriculture or small businesses when they have not left to seek their fortune 
  in Quito or in other countries. El Chaco is neither rich nor poor — nobody is 
  starving and nobody has riches. The people of El Chaco have learned to make 
  do with the basics. The same is true for the town's infrastructure: El Chaco 
  has schools but they are in a bad state; El Chaco has a health station but no 
  hospital and a doctor is often hard to find; El Chaco has access to the phone 
  but the lines are rare and calls expensive; El Chaco has roads, some good, mostly 
  bad, sometimes impassable.
  <p>The only special features that El Chaco has to offer, besides the outstanding 
  natural beauty that so often can be found in Ecuador, is that an oil pipeline 
  is running straight through it and that the river nearby is a paradise for all 
  kinds of water sports like rafting and kayaking, ranking as one of the best 
  in the world. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.chasquinet.org">Fundacion Chasquinet</a> is a small NGO 
  based in Quito. The work Chasquinet does can be simply described as supporting 
  the strategic use of the available information and communication technologies 
  (ICT) in the social sector, working on a national and international basis with 
  telecenters, schools, hospitals and NGO's. Chasquinet has established over the 
  years an &quot;open door&quot; policy, meaning that Chasquinet will not go into 
  the communities and establish its own projects but waits until the communities 
  come to Chasquinet and ask for support. In this way it is ensured that the work 
  Chasquinet is doing is based on the real needs of the communities and not the 
  needs perceived by Chasquinet for a community. Chasquinet enters a partnership 
  with the communities and the goal of these partnerships is community development. 
</p>
<p>In 2003 the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/">Canadian International Development 
  Research Center (IDRC)</a> and the <a href="http://www.icamericas.net/">Institute 
  for Connectivity in the Americas (ICA)</a> contacted Chasquinet asking if Chasquinet 
  would be able and willing to pilot Wi-Fi equipment in Ecuador. The equipment 
  was from the Canadian company <a href="http://www.eion.com/">EION</a> and consisted 
  of three Wi-Fi sets with surround coverage of 5 km with one set having an additional 
  25 km point to point connection. </p>
<p>At the same time the community of El Chaco contacted Chasquinet asking them 
  not only to help with their connectivity problem but also to help to make this 
  work for the social and economic development of the whole community.</p>
<p>El Chaco had already experience with the Internet connection, consisting of 
  a single computer at a restaurant. The connection was expensive and slow but 
  it had convinced many in El Chaco of the potential of the new ICT's and the 
  first question the community was looking for answers to was: How can we connect 
  El Chaco to the Internet in a cost efficient way?</p>
<p>What better place then to test the Wi-Fi equipment than El Chaco? However, 
  installing the equipment is just a small part of a successful project, and the 
  most important question that needed answering was: Connectivity for what?</p>
<p>A series of community meetings was called and the questions the people of El 
  Chaco wanted to answer soon became clear: How can the Internet help us in our 
  schools, in our local government, with the small and medium enterprises, with 
  the ecology, the health services and tourism? How can we make it sustainable 
  not only in a financial but also in a technical, social, cultural and political 
  sense? </p>
<p>To find the answers to these questions and to develop a strategic plan for 
  the implementation of the new information and communication technologies, Chasquinet 
  undertook a number of training and planning workshops. The training did not 
  just concentrate on the technical aspects of using computers. More important 
  was the training on the strategic use of these technologies: how to use the 
  Internet in schools, how could the local government take advantage, how to document 
  and protect the environmental treasures, how could the local enterprises be 
  supported, how could the local health station use it, and how could the Internet 
  be used to organize and promote local tourism?</p>
<table border="0" align="right" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">

One lesson Chasquinet has learned in the years of its existence is that social 
  transformation can only come through personal transformation so in addition 
  to the more Internet-concentrated workshops a &quot;Healing Touch&quot; workshop 
  was organized for the community. Healing Touch is a medical technique that combines 
  traditional indigenous healing traditions from North and South America, and 
  it proved to be a vital step in the sustainable community development of El 
  Chaco as it responded to deeply-rooted medical and cultural needs of the community. 
</p>
<p>After six month of training and consultations the community came up with their 
  plan to implement the Internet in El Chaco. The main points of this plan were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a Community Telecenter at a community center managed by a local 
  group.</li>
<li>In a first phase, only the Telecenter, the local Government and the Health 
  Center would be connected via Wi-Fi to the Internet.</li>
<li>The Telecenter would offer not just connectivity services to the community 
  but concentrate on offering training particular to teachers and pupils, local 
  government officials and local businesses.</li>
<li>Further points (schools, hotels, businesses, police station and so on) would 
  be connected to the Wi-Fi network only after the respective users had received 
  training at the Telecenter.</li></ul>
<table width="275" height="224" border="0" align="left" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
  <tr> 
    <td height="60" width="284">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The plan was immediately put into action. The Telecenter was created and the 
  workshops started and soon the Telecenter was a focal point of the community. 
  But there was still one problem; it was a telecenter without Tele, without any 
  Internet connection. Even if the Wi-Fi would be installed now it needed to be 
  connected to the Internet. Dial-up and any cable based solution were out of 
  the question due to their high costs. A technical investigation was undertaken 
  with the result that a combination between VSAT and Wi-Fi would be the best 
  and most cost effective solution, but the initial costs and the running costs 
  were still high. A solution was found when the local government and the semi-governmental 
  development agency for the Ecuadorian Amazon region, ECORAI, decided to share 
  the cost. </p>

    </tr>
  </table>
<p>The installation of the EION Wi-Fi equipment turned out to be easier then first 
  thought. Everybody involved was nervous to see if this new technology would 
  do what it promised, but after just a day and a half of installation the Wi-Fi 
  worked just fine. Throughout the installation local technicians from the telecenter 
  took part in order to learn how the system worked, to enable them to maintain 
  it in the future and to act as &quot;experts&quot; for further installations. 
  El Chaco was now on the Net and even with only three initial connection points 
  the impact could be felt immediately.</p>
<p>For the first time teachers and pupils had access to quality teaching materials, 
  for the first time families could communicate at a low cost with their loved 
  ones working abroad, for the first time the mayor and his staff could access 
  relevant governmental resources, for the first time the nurse could get advice 
  from doctors in Quito, for the first time traders could offer their goods outside 
  the local market, just a few examples from many. As one local woman expressed 
  it: &quot;I feel like El Chaco is for the first time on the map.&quot;</p>
<table border="0" align="left" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">

</table>
<p>This is a perfect example how a relatively simple and cheap project like the 
  Wi-Fi in El Chaco can have a big impact.</p>
<p>The main lessons learned from the project are: Wi-Fi, particularly in combination 
  with VSAT technology, can be a cost-effective way to connect rural communities, 
  but this connectivity will only have an impact if the system is implemented 
  by the respective community and used by them according to their needs. Training, 
  strategic use and community involvement are more important than the technology 
  itself.</p>

<p>Hello, &amp; greetings from Canada!</p>

<p>I found your article about the establishment of a wi-fi network in El Chaco to be most interesting. (I have travelled around Ecuador a little bit so I am somewhat familiar with the area). Can you tell me: is the telecentre in El Chaco still active? Do you know if anyone in El Chaco is using the internet to advance their education (i.e. online learning)?</p>

<p>Many thanks!<br />
Gina Bennett</p>
