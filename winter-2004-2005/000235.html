<div class="category_title">Technology and Grassroots Organizing for the Developmentally Disabled in Atlanta</div> <span class="posted">by David Blanchard</span>




<p>On a cool fall evening in Atlanta, dozens of individuals with developmental disabilities 
and their families and caretakers gathered with state legislators to discuss the 
myriad issues surrounding disabilities. Hosted by the <a href="http://www.aadd.org/">Atlanta 
Alliance on Developmental Disabilities</a>, an Atlanta-based nonprofit group, 
the educational forum included a spirited question-and-answer period and opportunities 
for one-on-one discussions between the audience and the legislators afterward.</p>
<p>Such outlets for feedback and information sharing with key decision makers represent 
an integral component of AADD's mission: to build communities of support for individuals, 
families and children with developmental disabilities. A lofty task, indeed, but 
one that is possible because AADD has harnessed a technology that enables it to 
communicate with, mobilize, and empower its members - while at the same time reaching 
out to new ones.</p> 
<p>Thanks to a web-based grassroots application developed through <a href="http://www.ciclt.com/">Capitol 
  Impact LLC</a>, AADD has streamlined communication with over 5,000 members and 
  similar organizations it partners with in Georgia. The system, which is integrated 
  into AADD's website and powered by Capitol Impact application technology, is 
  designed to allow AADD to personalize and maximize its message to appropriate 
  legislators and provide a network of contacts for its members. Implemented in 
  July 2003, the system has received rave reviews from users and helped AADD mobilize 
  its members -therefore strengthening its voice in legislative arenas. Recently 
  a member wrote to thank AADD for this online system, saying, &quot;thank you 
  for everything your agency does to keep me informed of what is happening and 
  what I need to be doing. Because of your work, parents and caregivers of disabled 
  persons are experiencing success in advocating. This is a good feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>The system's first facet involves a function that alerts members to upcoming 
  forums, issues, and legislation relating to disability issues. Tracking the 
  member's address and voting district, the system provides information about 
  upcoming events, forums and hearings on issues that could potentially affect 
  that member. In addition, the system provides the member with information about 
  his or her corresponding legislator or key decision maker, including contact 
  information and the legislator's voting history, reaction to surveys, and reactions 
  to disability issues. Utilizing such information allows AADD to focus its message 
  and make it more personalized, increasing the potential for the recipient to 
  be responsive to the organization's request for action. With information about 
  relevant issues and the means to contact a key decision maker just a click away, 
  responding and reacting to disability news or issues becomes a simple, quick 
  process.</p>
<p>The system also provides the framework for members to stay informed about upcoming 
  legislation that could affect them - without having to decipher pages of convoluted 
  legalese. Instead, AADD representatives stay abreast of bills in the development 
  stage, earmark those that could affect members, and provide commentary about 
  what the potential legislation would mean for them. Because the information 
  on the system coincides with that of the state's website, it's assured to be 
  as up-to-date as possible.</p>
<p>A third facet of the program provides an immense benefit for graduates of AADD's 
  Partners in Policymaking program, a long-term educational initiative that teaches 
  individuals affected by disabilities how to be self-advocates. The system provides 
  a network of contacts, or partners, grouped by topic areas such as geographic 
  locations, interests, and relevant issues. For example, if a graduate is looking 
  for information or contacts to help advocate for the passage of IDEA, a federal 
  law that protects children with disabilities right to an appropriate education, 
  they can find others around Georgia who have said that they are willing to help 
  in this area. </p>
<p>Because the system is grassroots in nature (facilitating one-on-one contact 
  between parties so well) and quick, comprehensive, and efficient, it has allowed 
  AADD to expand its message and membership in an unprecedented scope. As the 
  organization continues to grow, we will continue to rely on such innovative 
  technology to achieve our mission.</p>
