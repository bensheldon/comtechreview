<div class="category_title">Innovation in Nonprofit Technology: NPower Arizona</div> <span class="posted">by Patrick McWhortor</span>




<p>Innovation is not new to nonprofits. Faced with overwhelming community needs and 
tight budgets, nonprofits are always finding creative ways to build resources 
and deliver services. Yet when it comes to technology, many nonprofits don't have 
the resources or support to innovate new technologies or new uses of technology 
in their own work.</p>
<p>This article explores what technology innovation means for nonprofits - how some 
organizations are using technology to increase their impact, and how others can 
take these case studies and replicate the success in their own organization. It 
also discusses the roles that funders and technology service providers play in 
ensuring that all nonprofits have access to high quality, mission-driven technology 
services.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.valledelsol.com">Valle del Sol</a> is an example of a nonprofit 
  integrating new technology to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of service 
  delivery in the community. The largest Hispanic behavioral health and social 
  service agency in Phoenix, Valle del Sol has case managers visit families in 
  their homes, helping them connect with services for substance abuse, family 
  crisis, and other support. </p>
<table width="20%" border="0" align="right">

  </tr>

<p>As with many social service organizations, much of the one-on-one client work 
  of Valle del Sol happens in the field, while the data so important to facilitate 
  and measure the impact of that work lives in a computer at headquarters. </p>
<p>Valle del Sol saw this as more than just an efficiency issue. They found that 
  clinicians in the field were making notes and completing forms with the knowledge 
  and understanding of the family in front of them, but information and data was 
  being entered later into the computer by other staff without the same level 
  of knowledge about the client. There was a risk of data being entered incorrectly 
  or inaccurately, or funding agencies being billed inappropriately. Valle del 
  Sol wanted to find a way to enable staff in the field to quickly, easily, and 
  securely gather and upload data about clients, streamlining the process and 
  reducing the chance of errors.</p>

<p>Today, the solution is literally in hand. Valle del Sol is introducing wireless 
  personal digital assistants (PDAs) to 60 of its case managers, equipped with 
  software that manages all of the forms and data needed by field-based clinicians. 
  Family members can sign forms on the PDA screen, preventing the need for paper 
  forms. And once the data and signatures are gathered, they are instantly transmitted 
  by wireless communications to the database at headquarters. </p>
<p>Valle del Sol estimates case managers can see as many as two additional clients 
  per day, a 20% increase. Further, Valle del Sol can assure the data is clinically 
  accurate, reducing the risk of data and billing errors. Finally, field-based 
  case managers will have all of the most current data available about clients 
  on their PDA, which is connected live and securely to the Valle del Sol database. 
  This allows them to spot patterns in the data and suggest interventions while 
  they are with the client. These results improve effectiveness and expand the 
  capacity of services provided directly to clients.</p>
<p>For social service nonprofits, the old rules said that clinicians worked with 
  people, while data was often the property of processing personnel back in headquarters. 
  But if real-time access to data can make a difference in service delivery, clinicians 
  need to use it as a tool. </p>
<p>Valle del Sol solved that problem through innovation using wireless technology. 
  They demonstrated the observation by Michael Hammer and James Champy (in &quot;Reengineering 
  The Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution,&quot; HarperBusiness, 
  1993) that &quot;the real power of technology is not that it can make old processes 
  work better, but that it enables organizations to break old rules and create 
  new ways of working - that is, to reengineer. It is this disruptive power of 
  technology, its ability to break the rules that limit how we conduct our work, 
  that makes it critical.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, information technology has significantly changed 
  the way businesses work, increasing productivity, helping create new industries 
  and spurring innovation. Similar to the productivity gains and transformations 
  seen in the private sector, technology has the potential to transform nonprofits. 
</p>
<p>We already have examples: web-based earned income tax calculators that dramatically 
  increase the number of low-income individuals applying for and receiving <a href="http://www.icanefile.com/">earned 
  income tax credits</a>; easy-to-use web sites with self-help legal information 
  enabling legal services providers to serve many more individuals and families 
  (see <a href="http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1036108809.8/digital_divide.pdf">Julia 
  Gordon's report</a> for the <a href="http://www.nlada.org/Civil/Civil_EJN">Project 
  for the Future of Equal Justice</a>); and advocacy web sites such as <a href="http://www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> 
  changing the nature of grassroots engagement. </p>
<p>When we match the positive disruptive potential of technology with the passion 
  and experience of the nonprofit sector, we build healthier, more just communities 
  that can better offer safety, housing, economic opportunity and access to the 
  arts to all members.</p>
<span class="subhead">What is Innovation?</span>
  <p>We can think of innovation existing in &quot;layers&quot;:</p>
<ul> 
 <p><li><b>Adaptation:</b> New ways of doing the same thing (this is how Valle del Sol 
  approached innovation).</li>
  <li><b>Transfer:</b> Applying an existing way of doing something to another activity.</li>
  <li><b>Invention:</b> Envisioning and creating a whole new activity.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>The impact of innovation should be at least one of the following:</p>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Improvements in the way customers experience the organization.</li>
  <li>Direct benefits to customers.</li>
  <li>Expansion of the number, diversity or geographic reach of customers.</li>
  <li>Improvements in business processes that solve problems.</li></p>
  </ul>
<span class="subhead">How Can Innovation be Successful?</span>
  <p>Can other nonprofits envision innovative solutions, as the information technology 
  team at Valle del Sol did? Valle del Sol has more than 175 staff and will invest 
  more than $130,000 in direct costs to develop their solution. How can nonprofits 
  without that level of resources and capacity consider innovation? For that matter, 
  how does any organization replicate their success?</p>
<p>This case study and the literature suggest five criteria for success:</p>
  <p>
<ul><li><b>Investment:</b> technology innovation needs to be seen as a fundamental &quot;R&amp;D&quot; 
  function within the nonprofit sector.</li>
  <li><b>Success Metrics:</b> Projects must articulate &quot;bottom line&quot; measures, 
  which are tied to one of the four potential impacts of innovation outlined above.</li>
  <li><b>Collaboration:</b> in order to make the case for R&amp;D, nonprofits must 
  collaborate to develop tools and strategies that have an impact on customer 
  service and community impact. Funders are more likely to support investment 
  in broader community impact solutions than technology tools for one organization.</li>
  <li><b>Expertise:</b> Experts in the nonprofit world are rarely experts in technology, 
  but they understand their customers. Nonprofits need technologists who do not 
  sell software and hardware, but who take the time to understand and use the 
  expertise of nonprofit staff, like Valle del Sol case managers, to build a solution.</li>
  <li><b>Inspiration:</b> Nonprofits need reengineering case studies published in 
  books and articles; like the corporate sector, nonprofits need an entrepreneurial 
  marketplace to stimulate an ever-growing range of technology ideas and applications 
  for nonprofits. This could also spur collaborative opportunities. At the end 
  of the day, this means nonprofits sharing with one another.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>As nonprofits think about innovation, they will need the support of nonprofit 
  technology assistance providers (NTAPs), such as locally based <a href="http://www.npower.org">NPower</a> 
  programs, that foster the knowledge sharing, understanding of nonprofit expertise, 
  and collegiality that lead to innovation. </p>
<table width="25%" border="0" align="right">
  <tr> 
    <td>
      <div align="center"><img src="/winter-2004-2005/img/mcwhorterphoto3.gif" width="196" height="89" alt="NPower logo"></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These providers should demonstrate and embody the five success criteria of 
  innovation. They should develop technology plans that are mission-driven and 
  build the capacity of nonprofits to serve their communities. They should focus 
  on service more than just technology, posing questions such as &quot;What do 
  your customers need most from you that you aren't delivering?&quot; and &quot;What 
  key population aren't you reaching that you want to?&quot; </p>
<p>This type of inquiry goes beyond simply providing a piece of technology, and 
  will lead to true technology solutions and innovation. NTAPs need to be enablers 
  of innovation focused on improving the quality of life in our communities.</p>
<p>Innovation also requires resources. Funders can help nonprofits accelerate 
  the adoption of mission-supporting technology by providing grants that fund 
  specific technology projects, or by encouraging nonprofits to think through 
  how technology can extend the impact of new or existing programs. Working together, 
  nonprofits, NTAPs and funders can create a culture of responsible, collaborative 
  innovation that will benefit the entire nonprofit sector, and especially the 
  people it serves.</p>
<span class="subhead">Conclusion</span>
  <p>As <a href="http://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/definition.htm">Margaret 
  Wheatley notes</a>, &quot;Innovation is fostered by information gathered from 
  new connections; from insights gained by journeys into other disciplines or 
  places; from active, collegial networks and fluid, open boundaries. Innovation 
  arises from ongoing circles of exchange, where information is not just accumulated 
  or stored, but created. Knowledge is generated anew from connections that weren't 
  there before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Innovation&quot; is a keyword of this century. We hear it from business 
  leaders, technologists and academics. But innovation can begin in anyone's mind, 
  inspired by a desire to make the world a better place. What better minds to 
  put to innovation than nonprofit leaders who are already passionate about service 
  to their communities and earth? Hopefully, this article will inspire at least 
  one leader to imagine an innovation to explore and pass along to the sector, 
  making a difference in the lives of more people, in more communities than previously 
  thought possible. </p>
