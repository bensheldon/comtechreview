<div class="category_title">The TechXchange Coalition:  Regional Technology Assistance Coordination in Philadelphia</div> <span class="posted">by Jenny Pierce and Neville Vakharia</span>




<p>In recent years, the Greater Philadelphia region has experienced a tremendous 
increase in the number and quality of nonprofit technology assistance providers 
(NTAPs), coming from community-based organizations that have added technology 
support programs to enhance existing services and new organizations that have 
formed with nonprofit technology assistance as their core mission. In fall of 
2001, representatives from 23 NTAPs convened a meeting to explore how to better 
serve collective and individual constituencies. Out of this came the &quot;<a href="http://www.techxchange.org">TechXchange 
Coalition</a>&quot; — its development is informative and can serve as a model 
for other regions throughout the country.</p>
<p>With the increase in NTAPs serving the Greater Philadelphia Region, it was 
  clear that a coordinated approach would be very useful to address gaps in services, 
  duplications of services to the same constituencies, and problems arising from 
  competition for limited resources such as funding, sponsorships, volunteers, 
  and more. For example, while many NTAPs were offering software training as a 
  core service, not many NTAPs were providing routine maintenance and support 
  for technology. Many NTAPs were approaching the same funding sources, resulting 
  in an uncoordinated message to funders. </p>
<p>Believing that some type of formalized structure was needed to address this 
  situation, NTAP representatives created the TechXchange Coalition with a mission:</p>
<p><i>To increase the knowledge and awareness of the Greater Philadelphia Region's 
  nonprofit technology assistance providers among each other, our constituencies, 
  and the funding community; to create more efficient and collaborative approaches 
  among providers and funding sources; and to provide a forum for sharing ideas, 
  best practices, and resources.</i></p>
<p>Established to enhance the visibility of the providers to civic, government, 
  and corporate entities, the TechXchange Coalition is not a separate nonprofit 
  organization and is entirely overseen by its NTAP participants.</p>
<p><b>Early Successes</b></p>
<p>Initial efforts involved collaboration on training initiatives, leveraging 
  existing training facilities, instructors, and curricula. This resulted in higher 
  participation rates and expanded reach of training programs without a need to 
  duplicate services or facilities.</p>
<p>Collaboration opened up new funding opportunities, inaccessible to individual 
  projects alone. The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development 
  chose to announce a new technology granting program at a TechXchange Coalition 
  meeting prior to any public announcement, proving the strength and importance 
  of the coalition.</p>
<p>Funders in the region had long wished to better understand the technology detailed 
  in funding proposals they received and to learn more about the role of NTAPs 
  as a resource for their grantees. To address this issue, the TechXchange Coalition 
  approached a consortium of regional funders known as <a href="http://www.dvg.org/">Delaware 
  Valley Grantmakers (DVG)</a> to provide assistance. Because DVG was approached 
  by the Coalition rather than an individual NTAP, they were very receptive to 
  the idea. The Coalition continues to serve as a resource to the funding community.</p>
<p>From this initial work, Coalition participants realized that creating a strategic 
  plan for technology assistance to the whole region could serve as a key organizing 
  guide. After six months of focused effort, a strategic plan was set that addressed 
  many critical technology issues in the region along with Coalition strategies 
  for meeting them. The plan continues to serve as a guide and is one of the <a href="http://www.techxchange.org">Exchange 
  web site's</a> most useful resources.</p>
<p><b>Ongoing Success</b></p>
<p>As the coalition became more successful, its activities and influence increased. 
  In 2003, the <a href="http://www.nten.org">Nonprofit Technology Enterprise Network 
  (N-TEN) </a>was seeking a location for its first-ever, international conference 
  and selected Philadelphia, in large part because of the cooperation and coordination 
  TechXchange Coalition participants could provide with site selection, securing 
  local funding and sponsorships, organizing a volunteer day of service, and coordinating 
  local logistics. The conference, held in March 2004, drew over 700 people from 
  around the world.</p>
<p>The TechXchange Coalition continues to serve as vehicle for other significant 
  technology activities that impact the nonprofit community. When the <a href="http://mcot.phila.gov/back_pages/ICDL/GPGSC_ICDL.html">City 
  of Philadelphia decided to implement the International Computer Driving License 
  (ICDL)</a> program, a fundamental computer skills training initiative, the TechXchange 
  Coalition was the first place representatives from the City and ICDL approached, 
  knowing that coalition participants would be able to disseminate information 
  and create collaborations to make the ICDL program a success. The ICDL program 
  has now been launched and the first certifications issued. </p>
<p>The TechXchange Coalition has been involved in a wide range of activities in 
  the local CTCNet chapter, presenting at a variety conferences and seminars. 
  Social and networking events have helped NTAPs establish new contacts and expand 
  professional networks. Meetings feature guest speakers from the nonprofit, government, 
  or corporate sector.</p>
<p>TechXchange Coalition resources are informative to any geographic region that 
  contains multiple NTAPs providing a variety of technology programs and services. 
  They show how NTAP coalition-building can strengthen the NTAPs, the nonprofit 
  sector as a whole, and members of the surrounding communities.</p>
