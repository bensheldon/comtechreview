<h3 class="title">Welcome to Seattle</h3>

<p>
This year's CTCNet Conference in Seattle, Washington, brings us to the frontier of technology and strong community access.

Washington State is famous for apples, airplanes, salmon, scenic wilderness, logging, and software. The same frontier spirit that promotes and protects these assets may have also led to its deep immersion in community technology including public access TV, community networks, media arts, computer tech centers, leading library access, community Wi-Fi, and even community voice mail. On the business front <a href=" http://www.real.com/">Real Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> and many more have homes here. Seattle is home to the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, the northwest stop on Internet2. The foundation community, including the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, has been a strong supporter of technology literacy and integration efforts for libraries, schools, rural and urban areas.  Nearby Tacoma features <a href="http://www.click-network.com/">the Click! Network</a>, the municipally owned cable and broadband utility.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.jackstraw.org/">The Jack Straw Foundation</a> started as KRAB community radio in 1962 and now offers community audio access and training, including audio editing for visually impaired users. Public access TV centers in Seattle (now <a href="http://www.scantv.org/">SCAN</a>) and Olympia (<a href="http://www.tctv.net/">TCTV</a> started in 1982) have long been centers of community technology, and <a href="http://www.911media.org/">911 Media Arts</a> continues to pave the way for new media artists. The national <a href="http://www.cvm.org/">Community Voice Mail</a> began service in 1992. By 1996 Washington State had three community Free-Net networks:  the <a href="http://www.tcfn.org/">Columbia Free-Net</a>, <a href="http://www.tincan.org/">the Inland Northwest Community Access Network (TINCAN)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.scn.org/">Seattle Community Network</a>. All are still doing vital work, reaching urban and rural users with services including TINCAN's on-line Business Incubator. The WTO launched the worldwide <a href="http://www.indymedia.org">indymedia.org</a> community.  Now <a href="http://www.seattlewireless.net">Seattlewireless.net</a> leads a growing metropolitan community wireless network.
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.cityofseattle.net/tech/techmap.htm">City of Seattle's tech map</a> lists over 160 community access points in and around the metropolitan area. There's a strong belief here in investing in diverse community-driven CTCs.  <a href="http://www.hud.gov/nnw/nnwindex.html">Neighborhood Networks'</a> development in the housing community grew up here, with Washington State's Digital Promise leading the way. Now the <a href="http://psact.org/">Puget Sound Alliance for Community Technology (PSACT)</a> brings together CTCs and supporters to improve service delivery. <a href="http://www.npower.org/">Npower</a> started here and continues to assist non-profits, while <a href="http://www.onenw.org/">One Northwest</a> serves the environmental movement, <a href="http://www.digitalpartners.org/">Digital Partners</a> works worldwide, and <a href="http://projectalchemy.org/">Project Alchemy</a> supports progressive applications of technology. 
</p><p>
The City of Seattle provided public bulletin board access in 1995 and public Internet terminals a few years later. Seattle was the first in the nation to establish a community technology planner position, Technology Matching Fund and IT indicators. CTCs in the area receive strong support from the <a href="http://www.seattleschools.org/">Seattle Public Schools</a>, which has been involved in community technology since 1996 and is leading the way to a more systemic and systematic approach to connecting K-12 education and community technology efforts.
</p><p>
Community technology leaders from Washington state made significant contributions in planning the 2004 CTCNet Conference, as CTCNet engaged a local host committee including representatives from the City of Seattle, Seattle Public Schools, PSACT, the Seattle Public Library, the RECA Foundation, the Inland Northwest Community Access Network (TINCAN), <a href="http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/">the Seattle Art Museum</a>, and others, and the host committee is pleased to welcome the 2004 CTCNet Conference to Seattle!

<h3 class="title">Youth Engagement in Evaluation and Research</h3>

When young people are involved in community research and evaluation, all sides of the equation benefit greatly.  Youth engagement bridges the generation gap, provides important information from new perspectives, and builds both skills and community connections for the young people involved. Organizations have engaged young people in a diverse array of evaluation and research activities, including community mapping with photography, surveying other young people about attitudes related to drug and alcohol use, and assessing community need for services and advocating for new programs.  Still, there is a vast untapped potential for CTCs to engage the young people they serve in evaluation and research.
</p><p>
There are many good reasons to make an effort at engaging youth in these evaluation and community research projects.  First and foremost, CTCs can provide a great service to young people in their communities by helping them build skills applicable to both academic performance and future employment.  From research, analysis and communication, to databases, software and web development, there are plenty of areas in which young people can gain experience and prowess while providing a service to organizations.  CTCs have the opportunity to offer the opportunity for young people in their communities to develop a proud sense of civic leadership and community participation, which will be of lasting benefit for life.  Through evaluation and research projects with CTCs, young volunteers and their peers enhance their skills and self-esteem, and develop important relationships with professionals, researchers, and other adults.
</p><p>
Young people and organizations can form a mutually-beneficial relationship that promotes positive outcomes for everyone involved.  For CTCs, there are definite rewards to be reaped from engaging young people in community research and program evaluation.  Obviously, incorporating youth perspectives is of great importance to an organization that attempts to serve youth needs.  Often young people can provide information and insight that help CTCs make sure they stay relevant, informed, and connected to their segment of the community.  A healthy amount of diversity and intergenerational respect can be generated by involving young people in research, evaluation, and development.  In sum, CTCs have the power to strengthen local youth and their own organizational culture at the same time.
</p><p>
As with any worthwhile process, there are challenges involved.  Organizations that have engaged young people in research and evaluation projects have found that it involves a major investment of time, training, and support.  It can be difficult for a CTC to arrange its organizational capacity, in terms of funding and staff time, to allow for the special support that young volunteers may need.  In addition, combining rigorous research approaches with youth engagement is challenging and necessitates trusting young people to measure up to your organization's standards.  Another challenge that may arise is ensuring that youth findings and recommendations are treated seriously.  Youth-generated information may challenge established ideas and other findings, and organizations must make a special effort to address youth issues.  Finding the right balance between positive youth development and a CTC's research is by no means a simple task, but there is plenty to make it a rewarding effort.<br>

<h3 class="title">Emergence, Convergence, and Empowerment</h3>

<p>While the latter part of the twentieth century witnessed a growth in alternatives to mainstream corporate media, the technological advances of the 1990's--particularly the arrival of the World Wide Web--signaled the delivery of increasingly narrow distribution of specialized content to more fragmented audiences. In response to a growing tide of content offerings that are detached from, if not dissonant with, the real world, a small but growing number of individuals around the world are turning to alternative sources of news and information.
</p><p>
A new form of media convergence is rising at the grassroots level, empowering communities by giving people the tools to express themselves. Community technology centers, community media centers, telecenters, and independent media centers serve as agents of progressive social change, providing computer labs and digital media training to connect individuals, interest groups, and institutions with their neighborhoods, harnessing their shared strength and collective wisdom to create media that reflect the circumstances and experiences of real people. A team of leading media artists and educators is introducing workshop attendees to the exciting possibilities of this movement, offering strategies and practical advice on how to participate as national and international sites of civic expression and media production.

Spearheading this initiative is Fred Johnson, an Associate Professor at the University of Massachusetts-Boston's College of Public and Community Service, in the <a href="http://cpcs.umb.edu/cmt/">Community Media and Technology program</a>.  Johnson is a media artist, educator, documentary maker, policy analyst, and a consultant in communications and development. He has received a Fulbright Fellowship for the Television Arts, producing and directing documentaries for the BBC and for public television in the US. Johnson previously directed the Digital Directions project, a national planning process focused on the impact of digitization on the media arts, funded by the Ford Foundation, for the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC).  Johnson stresses that we are at a point in time when it is both possible and advisable to envision something other than a marginalized alternative media culture: "I can not let go of the idea that in this moment there may be an opportunity in the next few years to create the distribution systems, production and social practices and politics necessary for the creation of a much more robust, non-commercial media culture."
</p><p>
Other indy media leaders participating in this workshop include Nettrice Gaskins, Director of the <a href="http://www.cbcmedia.net/">Commonwealth Broadband Collaborative (CBC)</a>.  Gaskins has over ten years experience in multimedia/digital media, education/training, leadership, and program development, most recently as the director of the Multimedia Center at <a href="http://www.bnntv.org/">Boston Neighborhood Network (BNN)</a>. She has been a member of the CBC steering committee since its inception, is on the national board of CTCNet, and has developed online community media and technology courses for UMass Boston/College for Public and Community Service.  Gaskins states, "While new technologies such as wireless broadband and 'broadcatching' are emerging, convergence is creating virtual and actual environments where media makers are exploring ways to become more empowered."
</p><p>
In keeping with the theme of this year's Annual CTCNet Conference, this team is leading the way by showing how creative use of technology can help empower communities.  Independent community media are a vital resource.  At a time in which divergent and diffuse voices are being drowned out in mainstream media, the emergence of creative outlets and alternatives is crucial.  CTCs can be leaders in this movement, by using the resources that they already have, creatively using new tools, and understanding the transformational power that they have at hand.

The Annual CTCNet Conference provides an opportunity for people to share their organizational expertise and personal experiences towards a more active and informed community of interests.  This year we are working to highlight the resources and model programs that use technology in ways that inform and engage citizens and that contribute to community development.<br><br>
Community technology centers and programs continue to improve individual lives and foster healthy neighborhoods around the world. The capacity of the community technology field itself has grown to address a broader set of human needs and social priorities, including workforce development, education and literacy, youth media, immigration, health, public safety, housing, business and economic development, and civic engagement.
</p><p>
Community technology, in a relatively short period of time, has emerged as a vital social force that impacts the ways we think about, and act upon, the issues affecting our society. This year's meeting affords us a chance to recount our successes, recognize the diversity and creativity within our programs, and challenge ourselves to better address local community needs as we harness the power of people and technology to build connected communities.

We should never lose sight of basic needs within the core of our missions: equity in technology access and opportunities to acquire and apply technology skills. There is still much work to be done to ensure that vital information and communications technology tools and resources are affordable, accessible, and applicable to all people.  We hope to explore ways to sustain the momentum we have achieved while expanding the role for, and impact of, CTCs within the communities in which we work.</p><p>
We're looking forward to seeing you in Seattle and discussing the future of our field!<br>

Laura Breeden leads the Community, Technology and Learning group and the <a href="http://www.americaconnects.net/">America Connects Consortium (ACC)</a>, based at <a href="http://www.edc.org">Education Development Center</a> in Newton, MA.  ACC supports community technology centers across the nation by providing training, information, tools, and other resources that build organizational effectiveness.  From 1996 to 2000, Ms. Breeden was an independent consultant focusing on Internet strategies and organizational development. She also served as founding director of the highly competitive federal <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/top/">Technology Opportunities Program</a> at the Department of Commerce, designed to demonstrate the benefits of new information and communications technologies in the public sector.  Her technology experience dates from 1983, when she got her first Internet address and an account on a UNIX machine.  Laura holds a BA in Urban Education from Oberlin College and provides the following overview of her work.  
</p><p>
<b>General Work</b>
</p><p>
The Community, Technology and Learning group at EDC focuses on using technology more effectively in informal settings to support learning, career development, and civic participation.  We develop curriculum, training, evaluation tools, and other resources, and we work with programs in the field to improve and deepen practice. 
</p><p>
<b>Current Work in Research & Evaluation</b>
</p><p>
Our largest project currently is the America Connects Consortium or ACC, which is a partnership with CTCNet and the <a href="http://www.niost.org/">National Institute on Out-of-School Time</a>.  ACC began in September 2000 and is the technical assistance provider to the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/fund/grant/apply/AdultEd/CTC/index.html">US Department of Education's Community Technology Centers program</a>.  ACC has been providing evaluation assistance to grantees from its inception, and the literature review we completed in 2001 is still one of our "most downloaded" documents.  The project has developed a number of tools and resources to support evaluation, often in collaboration with CTCs in the field   This year we are engaged in several research activities, a software and literature review, and a major retrospective analysis of the CTC program since 1999. 
</p><p>
Other projects in the CTL group also work in evaluation and research.  The <a href="http://www.youthlearn.org/">YouthLearn Initiative</a> is developing an evaluation of youth media projects for the Time Warner Foundation, working with EDC's <a href="http://www2.edc.org/CCT/">Center for Children and Technology</a>.  And <a href="http://www2.edc.org/sciencequest/">ScienceQuest</a>, funded by the National Science Foundation, is evaluating its four-year record for publication in 2005. 
</p><p>
<b>Challenges</b>
</p><p>
One of the most serious challenges is that different funding agencies have different priorities (or they change their priorities frequently).  CTCs are then required to collect multiple kinds of data and generate reports targeted to the funder's interests.  Data collection can become a burdensome task that is disconnected from other work at the CTC, instead of being integrated into the culture of the organization and used to improve programs in a thoughtful way. 
</p><p>
We have worked with the field to develop data collection tools (like a database template and a Web-based benchmarking toolkit) that address the baseline problem of what to collect and how to collect it.  This lets staff focus more on interpreting and using the data.  We have also developed materials that show how data collection and evaluation can become part of the program planning and design cycle, rather than being an add-on to satisfy a reporting requirement.
</p><p>
Another challenge is that programs do not have opportunities to work together to define evaluation goals, processes, and standards.  So we're not learning as much from one another as we could; our work isn't additive.  We are trying to bring together a number of organizations with an interest in evaluating community technology programs to address this issue. 
</p><p>
<b>Advice for Other Practitioners</b>
</p><p>
I think it's very important for us to take the time to exchange ideas, learn from and critique each other's work, and build a common vocabulary around research and evaluation.  Community technology is an emergent area.  It's not mature or "finished."  We need consciously to create the systems that are required to improve what we do, because our task will take an entire generation; it's far from over. 
</p><p>
<b>Opportunities for Growth</b>
</p><p>
Another presentation in the R&E track is by Ken Thompson of the Gates Foundation, who has brought together a group of technology funders to look at gaps in evaluation.  Both the federal government, with its emphasis on performance and accountability, and the private foundations are increasing looking for "evidence-based" practices. Community technology programs are becoming more focused on outcomes, such as obtaining job skills or educational credentials.  Many are thinking not just about outcomes for individuals but community-level outcomes, as in the Ford Foundation project CTCNet is coordinating that links community development, community technology, and public spaces.  There is so much we need to know that research and evaluation have an enormous potential to tell us--if we can convince funders to invest, and we can come together wisely to share our experiences.

<h3 class="title">CTCNet Policy Framework</h3>

<i>This policy framework, adopted by the CTCNet Board of Directors in April 2004, lays out the values for the organization in its policy work and advcacy activities.</i>
</p><p>
The Community Technology Centers' Network is a US-based international network of more than 1000 organizations and individuals united in their commitment to improve the educational, economic, cultural and political life of their communities through technology. 
</p><p>
<b>Rationale</b>
</p><p>
CTCNet provides resources and advocacy to improve the quality and sustainability of urban and rural community technology centers and programs at the local, state, national and international level. This policy framework exists to:
<ul><li>communicate CTCNet's core values and goals to policymakers 
</li><li>assist CTCNet to identify key issues and monitor trends impacting membership 
</li><li>enable likeminded groups and networks to identify common interests that lead to collaborative action.</li></ul>
</p><p>
<b>Vision</b>
</p><p>
CTCNet envisions a growing network of community-based technology activity distinguished by the diversity, innovation and adaptability crucial to our core mission: creating strong, healthy, equitable and sustainable communities across the US and around the world.
</p><p>
<b>Principles</b>
</p><p>
Information and communications technology (ICT) literacy--the capacity and ability to easily and effectively access, process, develop, and use technology for enhanced participation in society--is increasingly required to fully engage in civic activities, achieve success in the global economy, and enjoy a better quality of life. CTCs meet the needs of diverse learners with different abilities, learning styles, and challenges in order to build greater ICT literacy in all persons.
</p><p>
<b>Goals</b>
</p><p>
The following goals guide the development, support, and expansion of meaningful community technology activity:
<ul><li>Improved coordination among public and private resources; building towards expanded bases of support for technical assistance, effective capacity building, and long-term sustainability;
</li><li>Greater ICT infrastructure building and deployment, including advanced and emerging technologies, in underserved communities
</li><li>Increased participation by community technology interests in determining standards to ensure that services and content are accessible to, usable by, and reflective of underserved audiences.</li></ul>
</p>

David Keyes is the Community Technology Program Manager for the City of Seattle Department of Information Technology and is Policy Chair on the Board of Directors of CTCNet. David was the first community technology planner in the country and developed the <a href="http://www.cityofseattle.net/tech/overview/claf.htm">city's citizens' literacy and access programs</a> starting in 1997.
</p><p>
David has been working in the field of community and civic applications of technology for 26 years. His prior experience includes community access television development, legal services and community legal education, housing advocacy, teen media literacy, online course authoring, community organizing, and educational television production. He has worked for non-profits, schools, industry and government. David grew up in Milwaukee, taught juggling at Yale, and rode upriver in Borneo on his way to live in Tasmania.  He is a graduate of Antioch College and the University of Washington Evans School of Public Affairs.  He is on the steering committee of his neighborhood's Columbia City Revitalization Committee (CCRC). 
</p><p>
David received the 2003 Technology to Empower Communities (TEC) award for outstanding community technology leaders presented at the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) annual legislative conference. Here is his overview:
</p><p>
<b>General Work</b>
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.cityofseattle.net/tech/">City of Seattle's Community Technology Program</a> provides a range of direct access and training, research and support services for the development of community technology centers, technology healthy communities, and electronic civic engagement. This includes free Internet terminals in public buildings, work with the Parks Department to establish CTCs in community centers, a Community Technology Site Directory, a Technology Matching Fund grant program, the Information Technology Indicators Project, a monthly <i>Brainstorm</i> community technology e-zine, an Info Age education curriculum, and the Comcast/City of Seattle community access broadband Internet connectivity project. 
</p><p>
I am also on the founding board of the <a href="http://psact.org/">Puget Sound Alliance for Community Technology (PSACT)</a>.
</p><p>
<b>Current Work in Policy</b>
</p><p>
As Policy Chair of CTCNet, we just passed a <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=193">policy framework</a> that cements our role as policy advocates and creates a path for the national organization to work with regional and local members to build their strength as advocates and enable national advocacy for specific legislation and supporting policy.  We've also just completed a <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/policy/">policy web site for CTCNet.</a>
</p><p>
At the City and regionally, we're starting to build a stronger awareness of what state policy initiatives are possible. This past year we completed work on the development of a Technology and Justice Bill of Rights under the leadership of the state <a href="http://www.wsba.org/atj/">Access to Justice</a> committee. Within the City, I'm working to infuse technology into our development of a citywide Race and Social Justice initiative and bring race and social justice work into the policies of our IT Department. We're also in the midst of a community needs assessment for our cable refranchising that will guide the City's positions as it enters negotiations. 
</p><p>
I recently met with a government group from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia about starting a CTC there. 
</p><p>
<b>Challenges</b>
</p><p>
For most people, community technology is not a unique recognizable work or constituency. Our work really supports youth, crime prevention, senior health, refugee resettlement, government services, etc. It's critical to frame our work in those contexts which people care deeply about and in abbreviated terms which busy folks and policymakers can latch on to. I think we've been successful at the City working internally and with community organizations to make clear how community technology support serves the city's core mission. 
</p><p>
It's also been challenging to get people to carve out the time to become directly engaged. I think we're still trying to negotiate this one. 
</p><p>
<b>Advice for Other Practitioners</b>
</p><p>
Create simple messages and demands backed with facts and human stories. You are experts in your field and community users are experts in their experiences...and have voting power. Use it. 
</p><p>
Utilize the networks of influence that exist already in your community. Develop long term communications with legislators; start this even before they run for office. There's a new <a href="http://ctcnet.org/policy/ten_simple_steps.htm">tip sheet</a> and resources on the CTC policy web site. Also, do use the resources of the <a href="http://www.cctpg.org/about.htm">California Community Tech Policy Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.techpolicybank.org">Techpolicybank</a>. Develop relations with staff at the local, county, and state level so that they understand your program and become your allies and champions internally. 
</p><p>
<b>Opportunities for Growth</b>
</p><p>
First, I think there are vital needs and opportunities to question and advocate for improved policies in workforce training, education, public safety and human services which recognize and address community technology centers as vital community institutions. Court settlements and regulatory fees and licenses have only been touched on.  We're giving away spectrum and not fostering enough private reinvestment in needy communities. 
</p><p>
Most importantly, I think we're starting to recognize our role in training community members to be engaged. It's a very tough climate right now, but I'm excited about the greater democracy and greater voice for what's really happening in our own community and those across the world that can result from this approach.

Paul Lamb is a writer, social entrepreneur, and business consultant. He is founder and Executive Director of <a href="http://www.streettech.org/">Street Tech</a>, winner of the 2002 California Governor's Technology & Innovation Award and the CompTIA 2002 Workforce Development Excellence Award. Paul is a board member and founding partner of the <a href="http://www.bapd.org/gbadve-1.html">Bay Area Technology and Education Collaborative (BayTEC)</a>. He is the former Director of Youth Services at the International Institute of the East Bay, where he developed and implemented school and community-based outreach programs for at-risk and gang youth. Paul has developed numerous youth mentorship programs in California and has a background in international business, having served as Director of Programs and Executive Director of the China Business Forum at the US-China Business Council in Washington, D.C. He is a graduate of Earlham College in Richmond, IN (B.A. political science,1986), The Johns Hopkins-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies in Nanjing, China (1990), and the University of California, San Diego's Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies (MPIA, 1995).  Here's Paul's update:
</p><p>
<b>Current Work in Program Design & Content</b>
</p><p>
Current projects include the launching of the <a href="http://www.reliatech.org/">ReliaTech</a> social enterprise, expansion of IT-focused workforce training programs at Street Tech, the mapping of a "Technology Roadmap" for California through the Z-Fellows at the <a href="http://www.zerodivide.org/">California Community Technology Foundation</a>, the expansion of computer training programs in California prisons, the leveraging of social networking as a tool for social justice, and the development of next generation community technology centers. 
</p><p>
<b>Challenges</b>
</p><p>
We have had to deal with an unpredictable IT job market and a growing trend toward the outsourcing of entry level IT work. Our solution is to take matters into our own hands, to be creative about developing alternative models for "insourcing." Rather than complain about the loss of jobs, we have decided to focus our energies on where the next generation opportunities lie, and build practical business models based on those opportunities. In the process I think we can create entirely new models for nonprofit and community sustainability. 
</p><p>
<b>Advice for Other Practitioners</b>
</p><p>
Professionalize your endeavors, create best practice standards, and don't give in to despair about the current funding environment. Most importantly, think outside the box about where new opportunities lie and where untapped potential exists. 
</p><p>
<b>Opportunities for Growth</b>
</p><p>
I see huge potential in this field.  Home technology integration, on-demand computing, VoIP, and other areas are ripe for IT workforce training models that can lead directly to jobs for entry level folks from disadvantaged communities. The challenge is to identify specific opportunities, get out in front of the herd, and keep our eyes focused on the horizon...always. Social enterprise and microenterprise are also two areas that CTC programs have yet to explore and leverage for our communities. There is tremendous potential here.
</P>

I manage the multi-media center in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I'm President of the Washington, DC-based legal defense fund, the <a href="http://www.theacd.org">Alliance for Communications Democracy</a>, and chair the editorial board of the <a href="http://www.communitymediareview.org"><i>Community Media Review</i></a> magazine.  I'm currently involved on the state level with e-Citizenship and broadband committees.  
</p><p>
<b>Current Work in Technology</b>
</p><p>
I'm now exploring social and economic development applications of WiFi.  We've just completed a wireless LAN connecting eight nonprofit organizations to the CMC for wireless broadband access.  We're also helping to establish a fiber optic urban loop for Internet2 access in Grand Rapids for hospitals, colleges, libraries, and our media center 
</p><p>
<b>Challenges</b>
</p><p>
Social development specialists don't often think of technology based solutions.  We have to "sell the dream" and solidify the outcomes to get folks to understand.  We use best practices and common analogies to help people see the future.  
</p><p>
<b>Advice for Other Practitioners</b>
</p><p>
Stay focused on outcome-based development.  What solutions are you seeking with what technological application?  Let people experience the technology in a fun and non-threatening way whenever possible.  
</p><p>
<b>Opportunities for Growth</b>
</p><p>
This is the future.  The ubiquitous blending of voice, video, and data into a wireless bit stream for cheap and easy access most anywhere will revolutionize many things we do.  We non-profit technologists/social servants need to keep abreast of trends and policies to insure equal access and distribution for all!

<h3 class="title">Editors' Introduction: East Side, West Side...</h3>

<p>
From small gatherings and early conferences in New York and Boston, the Annual CTCNet Conference has grown in scope and traveled across the land, to Washington, DC, farther south to Atlanta and Austin and San Diego, through Pittsburgh and Chicago in the midwest, and now to the northwest, Seattle.
</p><p>
As the country's oldest and largest association of organizations providing technology access, education, and support to underserved communities, CTCNet represents programs ranging from basic access and support to advanced multimedia applications and wireless zones, from human services and community organizing to business and economic development.
</p><p>
The Annual CTCNet Conference reflects the diversity of the community technology movement, last year drawing attendance from nearly every state and twelve countries. It also reinforces the need to incorporate, rather than simply accommodate, the perspectives and talents of communities of color and people with disabilities. This year's pre-conference and schedule includes an added emphasis on disability access and assistive technology, including a special advance screening of the documentary <i>Freedom Machines</i>, scheduled to air nationally on PBS this fall.
</p><p>
Finally, in a world where daily organizational demands are generally overwhelming, the CTCNet conference represents one of the few community technology gatherings where there are reflective and thoughtful presentations and discussions that are then available in a repository for future use.  As with last year, when CTC VISTAs Melissa Daigle and Dan Schackman pulled together the first <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/issue.php?issue_id=2">special issue of the <i>Community Technology Review</i></a> to supplement the 2003 DC national conference and offer a portal to its archives, this year's similar efforts by Dan Schackman, once again, along with Ryan Turner at CTCNet and Caroline Bennett, CTC VISTA and Assistant <i>Review</i> editor, provide a special dimension to the conference proceedings and gathering.  Like last year's issue, the articles and spotlights here and the links to the workshops that connect with presentation material provide not only a historical record of presenters and their resources, but a living archive to build upon and grow with. 
</p><p>
There are few conferences that we know of that are able to bring together so much that is testimony to the ongoing vitality of these kinds of gatherings.  Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility has supported a biannual gathering to examine Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing with a community technology perspective, and the DIAC proceedings are <a href="http://www.cpsr.org/conferences/conferences.html">summarized online</a> and are available in hardcopy.  The <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/top/research/research.htm">reports and evaluations</a> of the Department of Commerce's Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) are another special resource in this regard.  CTCNet's recent track record in documenting its lessons at these gatherings is exemplary.  Congratulations, once again. We're pleased to support this effort. --pm & rc

<h3 class="title">Staffing for Sustainability: CTCs in Cleveland</h3>

<b>Introduction</b><br><br>
Opening a Community Technology Center (CTC) typically requires fewer resources than sustaining its operations over time.  "If you build it, they will come" may have worked for Kevin Costner in <i>Field of Dreams</i>, but keeping it going and growing over the long-term can be a daunting challenge.  Every community technology center must have a sound sustainability plan, to both satisfy donors and engage in effective planning.  Determining a long-range staffing plan is a key component of overall sustainability. 
</p><p>
In 2003, I was awarded a research grant from the <a href="http://www.cwru.edu/mandelcenter/">Mandel Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Case Western Reserve University</a> to study CTC staffing models.  The Mandel Center, founded in 1984, is one of the nation's first comprehensive nonprofit management programs.  The Center's Research Office offers grants to foster research on nonprofit topics of consequence to the community.  Besides myself, the research team consisted of Professor John Yankey and Ann Lucas, Director of Professional Development Programs.   
</p><p>
<b>Project Background</b>
</p><p>
The research focused on the staffing patterns of Cleveland's Community Technology Centers. The full findings provide CTC decision makers with an overview of their peers' staffing patterns and needs and will hopefully open the door to further inquiry. 
</p><p>
According to <a href="http://www.clevelanddigitalvision.org/">Cleveland Digital Vision</a>, a coalition of organizations working to eliminate the digital divide, the greater Cleveland area has approximately 74 sites where the public can access computer technology and the Internet.  The sites include 24 neighborhood computer centers, 21 recreation centers, and 29 public libraries.
</p><p>
While time and available resources did not permit visiting each of Cleveland's CTCs, a sample of nine CTCs representative of the range of available programs and services was studied.  The sample included CTCs operated by neighborhood groups, libraries, community development corporations, recreation centers, and churches, and centers with no outside affiliation.  Each sample CTC was visited and surveyed regarding its approach to staffing.  Full participation required following Case Western Reserve University's Institutional Review Board protocol. The findings are summarized below. 
</p><p>
<b>Research Findings</b>
<ul><li>On average, each CTC operates 47 hours each week (Monday-Sunday) with no significant "down time" beyond major holidays. 
</li><li> 89% have at least one full-time staff person.  Full-time is defined as an employee who works approximately 40 hours per week on either an hourly or salaried basis.
</li><li>78% have part-time staff.  Part-time is defined as a regularly employed person working less than 40 hours per week on either an hourly or salaried basis. 
</li><li>33% currently have volunteer support and 56% had volunteer support in the past.  A volunteer is defined as a person who works at the CTC and is not financially compensated for their time.
</li><li>22% currently have subsidized staff and 56% used subsidized staff in the past.  A subsidized staff person is someone who is paid to work at the CTC but not by the CTC itself.  Examples of subsidized staff found in the CTCs studied include: VISTA members, AmeriCorps members, persons doing social work field placements, and work-study students. </li></ul>
</p><p>
<b>Staffing for Sustainability</b>
</p><p>
Despite the small sample size, a trend was identified and can serve as the basis for inquiry beyond the predefined scope of the present research.  According to the findings, CTCs used volunteers and subsidized staff in the past more than in the present.  This trend might raise the question: "Why were volunteers and subsidized staff used more in the past than in the present?"  
</p><p>
One possible answer is that, in the past, volunteers and subsidized staff were relied upon to "build" CTCsÑwriting curriculum, setting-up computers, building networks, and installing software.  Volunteers and subsidized staff can fill other roles once a CTC is beyond the start-up phase.  The valuable but low to no-cost work that volunteers and subsidized staff perform can help sustain a CTC.  A few examples of sustaining roles played by volunteers and subsidized staff at Cleveland's CTCs include: updating curriculum, offering tutoring, lending expertise (such as an accountant offering e-filing during tax time), conducting marketing and outreach to bring people into a CTC, organizing community meetings, and assessing client satisfaction with programs.  
</p><p>
Undoubtedly, other roles for volunteers and subsidized staff exist at CTCs.  Developing a strategy to drive a CTC's mission with available resources is critical for long-term sustainability.  The creative use of volunteers and subsidized staff is one way to help sustain a CTC by stretching available funding further while at the same time delivering outcomes that meet community need.

<h3 class="title">Community Technology Policy Actions at the State Level</h3>

<p>The community technology movement is becoming increasingly involved in policy discussions and actions locally, statewide and nationally.  CTCNet, regional groups of CTCs, and individual CTCs are recognizing the need to advocate for community technology.  It is easy to dismiss politicians and policy discussions as unimportant to our daily work, the work that is in the trenches and making a difference to the lives of those we serve.  But the reality is that legislators and their aides have a tremendous impact on how we live our lives and the important community technology work we do.  They regularly make decisions important to us, from broadband access to community technology funding.  
</p><p>
The importance of policy is evident in the presence of a whole track at this year's CTCNet Conference devoted to policy work.  "The Community Technology Policy Actions at the State Level" session, led by seasoned state-level CTC advocates, will focus on current and emerging policy efforts.  The session will focus on legislation, community technology education days and interaction with state Public Utility Commissions.  Legislation beneficial to community technology programs has already passed in Illinois and California.  Additional legislation is being pursued in California and Ohio.  
</p><p>
Community technology education days bring community technology practitioners and advocates to a state capital to educate legislators.  Community technology education days have been held in <a href="http://www.cctpg.org/">California</a>, <a href="http://www.illinoislawhelp.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.dsp_content&contentID=2229">Illinois</a>, and <a href="http://www.occcn.org/ctceducationday/pressrelease.htm">Ohio</a>.  In the same three states. community technology centers have received funding as a result of settlement agreements between Public Utility Commissions and regulated telecommunication companies. 
</p><p>
The big picture process is best described in the three step process of education, legislation, and implementation.  Implementation can take place without new legislation.  The session will include a discussion on how to utilize current legislation to the benefit of community technology centers.
</p><p>
The session is set to be a facilitated discussion between the presenters and the participants to ensure the maximum benefit to the participants.  To aid interaction among the participants and others, the session includes activities on how to organize and conduct a state community technology education day.

<h3 class="title">Know Your Rights: Digitally Connecting CTC Users to the Law and Legal Resources</h3>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/">the Pew Internet and American Life Project</a>, 80% of people with access to the Internet use it to search for answers to a specific question.  Staff members of community technology programs understand the challenges of helping their members find quality online resources to answer those specific questions.  This June at the annual CTCNet conference in Seattle, Pro Bono Net presents a workshop that examines online resources available when those questions involve legal problems.   
</p><p>
Each year only 20% of the civil legal needs of the poor in the United States are met, according to a study by the American Bar Association.  That means that each year 80% of people living near the poverty level in this country who have a legal problem cannot access an attorney and cannot find the answers they need to solve their problems.  Technology provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between legal needs and answers.  In fact, pilot projects are showing that greater access to justice can be achieved using a combination of technology, trained staff/volunteers, and partnerships to provide such individuals with the information and tools to address their legal problems.  Ensuring that the technology delivers quality content and reaches its target audience are the biggest challenges.  Echoing the well-known <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/research/cswr/projects/pj0131.html">Children's Partnership report</a>, Tom Kamber (formerly of One Economy Corporation) noted in a <i>City Limits</i> article earlier this year that the lack of quality online content for low-income users has been overlooked in the struggle to provide access to the Internet: 
</p><p>
"More frustrating than the continued existence of the digital divide is the degree to which policymakers and activists have focused on that single problem, missing opportunities to use the technology, right now, to help people overcome the challenges of poverty. Getting lost in all the concern over the digital divide are the needs of those who are already online."</p><p>

</table>To this end, for the past three years Pro Bono Net has partnered with nonprofit legal aid organizations across the country to build <a href="http://www.lawhelp.org">LawHelp.org</a>, a national legal information web portal.  LawHelp utilizes a national database yet decentralized content management structure, placing content control directly in the hands of local legal services organizations and attorneys.  By doing so, LawHelp.org provides state-specific legal self-help materials, court forms, social and legal services referral information, and other relevant information for the legal needs of the poor.  Content covered in most states includes family law, domestic violence, housing, public benefits, immigration, and health, among other topics.

To access information, a user enters his/her zip code, selects the legal problem, and within two clicks reaches specific information such as the intake hours for domestic violence cases at the local legal aid office, or what to do if served with divorce papers, or the exact legal rights when a landlord turns off the heat to save money.  In addition, there are over 1200 resources in non-English languages, including some state sites entirely in Spanish and other languages.  Most importantly, the information on all of these sites has been reviewed by the attorneys who represent low-income users each day and understand their complex legal needs.  
</p><p>
Another exciting example of innovative content for the poor available though the LawHelp system is the I CAN! online filing system, developed by the Legal Society of Orange County.  I-CAN Efile is helping to expand people's awareness and ability to claim the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit (referred to as EITC or EIC).  The EITC is a $31 billion program and can return as much as $4,140 a year to a low-income, working family.  Online forms are available in several languages and enable applicants to file for their state and federal returns online at their local CTC, saving them time and money. [See previous <i>Review</i> articles on <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=36">I-CAN efile and the <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/article.php?article_id=181">Boston EITC and Technology Access Project</a>.]
</p><p>
In spite of the fact that quality content does exist, it can be very difficult to distinguish a reputable legal information site from many less than reputable sites on the Internet today.  Further, conducting a legal search on Google (as with many searches) can be overwhelming and unproductive.  A Google search on "free legal help" returns over 12 million sites; a search for "need a pro bono attorney" returns nearly 100,000 sites.  Starting with a national portal like LawHelp.org, a state bar association web site, or a state court web site will yield better, more specific search results, from reputable legal organizations.  Maryland Legal Assistance Network has a helpful online guide, "<a href="http://www.peoples-law.org/finding/legal-sites/select%20websites.htm">Legal Websites: Separating the Good from the Bad and the Ugly</a>," which aims to help users make sense of online legal information.  CTCs can play an important role in helping members distinguish these differences; our workshop explores how to find and recognize these good sites.  
</p><p>
Finally, CTCs are uniquely positioned to partner with the legal services community to serve as an outlet for legal information and other critical services for those 80% of people with a legal problem who cannot otherwise access an attorney or information.  To help with such opportunities, our workshop provides a tour of LawHelp and other legal sites, examines online legal resources (local and national) for CTC users, covers how to recognize quality online legal content, and demonstrates partnership opportunities with local legal services programs.

Making technology accessible for people with disabilities is one of the hallmarks of the community technology field.  It is estimated that one in five Americans has some form of disability.  Technology can be a key component to improving their quality of life.  CTCNet has teamed with the <a href="http://www.ataccess.org/">Alliance for Technology Access (ATA)</a>, along with <a href="http://techmission.org/index.html">TechMission</a>, to deliver accessibility training and resources for CTCs and community- and faith-based organizations through the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/c4t/">Connections for Tomorrow (C4T) initiative.</a>  ATA's mission is "to increase the use of technology by children and adults with disabilities and functional limitations."  ATA's "Cool Tools" workshop is a sampler of the latest and greatest assistive technology.  ATA workshops strive to increase awareness of the breadth and depth of tools to make technology more useful to people with disabilities, develop strategies for customizing standard computer interfaces, and share information about the tools with the most potential for your center and environment.
</p><p>
While some organizations may feel daunted by the prospect of assistive technology, perhaps believing that it is going to be a major financial drain, it need not be.  Through Connections for Tomorrow, ATA has developed an Assistive Technology Package with exciting and innovative tools for less than $500.  The package is being successfully implemented by C4T grantees such as the <a href="http://www.lccil.org/">Lake County Center for Independent Living</a> in Mundelein, IL. These are not only affordable resources, they are some very cool tools!

When planning for bringing assistive technology into your site, there are some fundamental questions you need to begin with:  Who uses community technology centers and who doesn't?  How can you welcome unserved people from your communities? How can you meet diverse learning and physical needs?  Becoming aware of the breadth and depth of tools available can help you make your center more accessible and welcoming to people with disabilities.
</p><p>
At the Cool Tools workshop, attendees learn to customize computer interfaces to meet the needs of all visitors, especially for people who have difficulty with reading and writing, seeing and hearing, mousing and typing.  Tools include alternate input technology (hardware and software), voice recognition systems, on-screen keyboards, word prediction software, screen enlargement and screen reader programs, reading and writing tools, reading comprehension tools, writing support tools, and screen enlargement with supplementary speech software.  The session, presented by Russ Holland and David Grass, includes hands-on demonstrations, discussion of features of the tools, strategies for implementing their usage, and examples of how they are being used at other CTCs.

<em>Freedom Machines</em>, a documentary that will be airing this fall on PBS and is being shown as a pre-conference event Thursday evening, explores the remarkable power that technology has to transform the lives of people with disabilities. The Alliance for Technology Access (ATA) has been very involved in the development of this film, with an award winning crew and Oscar-nominated producer. Shot in nine locations around the U.S &#8212; including several ATA centers &#8212; with characters ranging from 7 to 92 years of age, Freedom Machines is not only a revelation but also a call to action. The film's web site <a href="www.freedommachines.com">www.freedommachines.com</a> provides useful information to supplement the documentary both in educating people about disabilities and how technology and civil rights laws can bring us closer to a world that is more inclusive for everyone.
