The quality of technical assistance CTC VISTAs bring to their client communities is unprecedented and represents cutting edge demonstrations of what needs to be happen in all our communities. </p><p>These Community Networking projects include dramatically effective computer recycling programs, new consortia for sharing digital video across community media projects, large scale community computer and Internet training programs, historical archiving and storytelling on the web, new community collaboration software systems, cost-effective wireless home access, and more. The number of sophisticated community sites developed with a range of integrated customized and interactive capacities is astonishing. </p><p>Here are some highlights from their mid-year reports:</p><ul>  <li><a href="http://otxwest.org/movies/OTX_video_guide.wmv"><img src="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/report/files/images/otx_video.thumbnail.jpg" class="float_right" /></a><strong>Marcus A.

CTCNet Chicago has convened several major statewide events: the Digital Literacy Showcase, the Digital Neighborhoods Fundraiser, the Statewide Conference, and the launch of the statewide coalition on Community Tech Day. We've formulated the database staretgy and a sustainability plan. We've made an impact on the vision for the state community technology sector and launched a ring of websites in addition to the relaunch of our own site on a content managment system. This makes the generation of content much easier and more easily shared. Additionally we've put other webtools and communications infrastructure in place: phplist for our ilctc Bulletin, webforms for feedback, and hylafax for blast communications. Dave has specific experience in website design and search engine optimization techniques which has made progress in support of our website much faster. He's allowed us to help some connected organizations to advance their web strategy, building the reputation of our organization in the process.&rdquo;</li>  <li><img src="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/report/files/images/spokane.thumbnail.jpg" class="float_right"/><strong><a href="www.tincan.org">TINCAN</a> (The Inland Northwest Community Access Network), Spokane, WA: </strong>Second Year CTC VISTA <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/nora_lollar/">Nora Lollar</a> is the Director of TINCAN's Inland Northwest Memories Project (<a href="http://history.tincan.org/">http://history.tincan.org</a>).
