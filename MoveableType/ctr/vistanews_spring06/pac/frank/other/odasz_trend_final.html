We&rsquo;re learning that there are successively greater benefits from sharing information as the tools and our collaboration skills evolve. As more people elevate their perceptions and ability to exercise collaborative best practices sharing information; the overall benefits to everyone involved grows exponentially. Globally, we&rsquo;re seeing the simultaneous realization that fundamentally important points need to be continually revisited regarding motivating and training citizens in the use of Internet collaborative tools and their best applications. This article strives to highlight a few of the current trends in knowledge management in how it could pertain to the work of the community networking projects. </p><p><strong>1. Addressing Motivation by Identifying Clear Benefits</strong><br />  Globally, the necessity of local grassroots champions to inspire and train locals in best practices is becoming clearer as is the need to share success stories across cultures and conceptual boundaries.&nbsp; At the recent Asian Pacific Economic Council conference, it was stated that the next billion people due to come onto the Internet are likely to be those living in poverty. A presentation from Chinese Taipei shared the story that the government was concerned about an indigenous tribe who preferred a type of loincloth to wearing pants, and sent a truckload of pants without asking the villagers if they wanted to wear pants (they did not.) The same is true with broadband; governments too often assume that everyone understand the benefits of broadband when they do not.<br />Note: Even in most developed countries broadband &ldquo;take-up&rdquo; is 25-40% with entertainment, not ecommerce, as the dominant application. (<a href="http://learnit.org">Nortel</a> has Information Technology Instructional videos, as does an <a href="http://alaskaruralbroadband.blogspot.com">Alaskan Native Video Blog</a>.)</p><p><strong>2. Providing Appropriate Motivational Training and Tools</strong><br />  At issue is what specific training on which specific tools will provide the greatest benefits for specific needs. We&rsquo;re at a point in human history where social engineering methodologies and global citizenship awareness-raising best practices are co-emerging simultaneously. New tools such as Blogs, Video Blogs (Vlogs), Really Simple Syndication (RSS), wikis, content management systems, and the use of distance learning free tools like <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle.org</a> create the opportunity for anyone, anywhere to empower both themselves and countless others, worldwide. </p><p><strong>3. Defining an American Mission for Broadband<br /></strong>The future of America&rsquo;s communities and neighborhoods rest on our abilities to become lifelong self-directed learners, global entrepreneurs, and our ability to tell our stories effectively and digitally. The <a href="http://lone-eagles.com/saci.htm&nbsp;">Strengthening America&rsquo;s Communities Initiative</a> states that our competitiveness in the global economy depends on our ability to stimulate ongoing education and innovation among our citizenry at all levels.</p><p>The recent <strong><a href="www.telecomreview.ca">Canadian Telecommunications Policy Review Report</a></strong> states eloquently, and at length (400+ pages), that <strong>Canadians MUST learn to use broadband technologies well to build social and economic capacity to be competitive and productive</strong>. This report <a href="http://www.telecomreview.ca/"></a> emphasizes that <strong>ubiquitous broadband and a National ICT Adoption Strategy are paramount</strong>. </p><p><strong>4. Governmental Championing of the Sustainability of Local Champions</strong><br />  The extensibility of positive impact that one individual or a small group can make worldwide through sharing new tools, training resources, and/or open knowledge curriculum is just beginning to be appreciated. One such example is that of grassroots champions with the Canadian CAP/CTC program as their lessons learned regarding sustainability relate directly to similar lessons learned from the CTC VISTA project.</p><p>  The CTC VISTA project is certainly on the cutting edge of demonstrating new technologies and citizen engagement methodologies, led by volunteer grassroots champions. But the sustainability of both the community technology centers (CTCs) and the ongoing services of the champions will depend on developing an economic model. An ideal case would be for champions to develop portfolios of successful skills outcomes resulting from their volunteered training as the basis for creating a sustainable fee-based entrepreneurial self-employment business. The role of top-down governments at all levels as a necessary partner for supporting and sustaining the necessary bottom-up training activities is becoming clearer as a major global issue related directly to community, regional, and national economic sustainability. <br />  <br />  <strong>5.   Peer-to-Peer Social Networking &ndash; The Next Big Thing</strong><br />Dramatic evidence has already proven that wonderful collaborations are indeed made possible by the increasing numbers of people with Internet access and the proliferation of free Web tools. For example, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> has over one million donated articles submitted by volunteers and is larger than the Encyclopedia Britannica. <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> has 181 million users which would make it the ninth largest country on the planet. With the  purchase of Skype, which now offers free video conferencing in addition to free VOIP, eBay will continue to grow at an astounding rate. The implications for collaborative international trade are overwhelmingly obvious.&nbsp; <a href="http://moveon.org">Moveon.org</a>  is an example of effective political activism and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> is an example of effective transnational activism.</p><p><strong>6. The Internet is Changing World Views and Creating a Global Citizenry</strong><br />  The Internet is transforming our definitions of community, individual and cultural identity as we&rsquo;re learning to collaborate beyond historical boundaries of time and space. As more people become global citizens, their world view changes. Tolerance for diversity of the world views of others is perhaps the single most significant insight that education, and global connectivity, offer as a hope for the sustained future of us all.</p><p>While many in rural and urban communities struggle to grow their imaginations, more and more people are recognizing the liberating realities for taking purposeful action as global citizens to create the type of world that allows us all to make a life while making a living by contributing meaningfully. The day is coming when the majority of the global population will become global citizens with the  perspective that embraces our diversity as a celebration of our commonalities and joint human spirit. Indisputable truths will become widely recognized as we grow our understanding that as one human family - if we all share what we&rsquo;re learning, we&rsquo;ll all have access to all our knowledge.</p><p><img src="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/report/files/images/loneeagle_logo.preview.gif" class="float_right" /> Pray for Peace, and Take Action Locally and Globally. </p><p>(For more <strong> Ecommerce, K12, and Community Network Open Knowledge Resources, check out the <a href="http://lone-eagles.com/future-proofing.htm">Lone Eagle website</a>.) </strong> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
