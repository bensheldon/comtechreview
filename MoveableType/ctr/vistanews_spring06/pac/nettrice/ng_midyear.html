Gaskins, Digital Media With Youth Priority-Area Coordinator</p><p><img src="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/report/files/images/gaskins_pso.preview.jpg" />This year more than fifteen CTC VISTAs were placed with community media and technology programs to help young people gain digital media skills that prepare them for college and tomorrow's workforce. Digital media encompasses digital video, digital audio, the World Wide Web, other technologies and applications that can be used to create and distribute digital content.&nbsp; However, it is important for new CTC VISTAs not be distracted by just learning new tools and applications but to also understand the <strong>process</strong> of teaching youth to make digital media. During their mid-year reflections, many CTC VISTAs reported that the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/pa/digital-media/">priority-area web site</a>, a collection of digital media/youth-related resources, and the <a href="http://cpcs.umb.edu/vista/forums/">bulletin board</a> were very helpful in this regard.</p><p>The challenges expressed by the CTC VISTAs in the digital media for youth area in their mid-year reflections were not surprising and often are the challenges faced by youth workers in non-profit environments: </p><ul>  <li>ever-increasing scope of their projects/programs with limited resources and manpower.</li>  <li>clear expectations of project/program outcomes as well as limited support from their immediate supervisors to complete their work plans/goals</li>  <li>overwhelming workloads and needing more skills and training (technical, organizational, youth, etc.)</li>  <li>keeping youth engaged and motivated throughout the course of their projects/programs, while maintaining and maximizing youth participation and attendance.</li></ul><p>In spite of these challenges, several CTC VISTAs reported success in combining their work with both new digital media and youth development: </p><ul>  <li><a href="http://www.themediaandthemessage.blogspot.com/"><img src="http://portal.nettrice.us/digital_media/mmmag.jpg" class="float_right"></a>CTC VISTA <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/cara_powers/">Cara Powers </a>(from <a href="http://www.utec-lowell.org/">United Teen Equality Center (UTEC)</a>) launched a <a href="http://www.themediaandthemessage.blogspot.com/">weblog</a> and posted information about her ideas on developing a youth multimedia magazine program.
