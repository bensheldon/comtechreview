This article will explore some of current trends and challenges in digital media that impact individuals and communities, especially the digital media for youth CTC VISTAs. </p><p><img src="http://portal.nettrice.us/digital_media/images/1pic1.jpg" class="float_right" />First we should consider the major trends that are emerging and that impact society, especially youth growing up in the sensory-inundated environment of digital technology and mass media in the 21st century. Some of the most relevant of these trends include:</p><ul type="disc">  <li><strong>Open Source Applications</strong> - Using      &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a>&rdquo; code that is freely distributed by those who write it, these new applications are used to power the Internet,      create operating systems, distribute media, and produce software.&nbsp; Just as open source developers have developed <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> as an alternative to Microsoft and other commercial productivity suites, so multi-media developers have also developed free or low-cost alternatives to software such as Adobe Photoshop or Macromedia Dreamweaver, two industry-standard applications, <a href="http://www.picasa.com">Picasa</a> and <a href="http://www.nvu.com">Nvu</a>. </li></ul><ul type="disc">  <li><strong>Online video (and audio)</strong> - Due to growing bandwidth, easier access to the means of production,      and cheaper storage online, video is fast becoming a real and different      way for people to experience stories: news, entertainment, etc.&nbsp; Some examples include <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>,      <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>. </li></ul><ul type="disc">  <li><strong>Participatory media and personal      broadcasting</strong> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webloghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Weblogs</a> (or blogs) allow      people with minimal technical skill to publish well-designed web sites      that invite interactivity and response from others. This potential combined with the ability of both      professionals and amateurs to access and use digital audio and video equipment  and make the content available on the Internet has      resulted in an explosive growth in <a href="http://freevlog.org/tutorial/">video blogging</a> (or vlogging) and video      <a href="http://cogdog.wikispaces.com/podcasting">podcasting</a> (or vodcasting). In this new model, media is delivered by      audience members to other audience members and often integrates a      conversation among the people in the audience.&nbsp; In fact, the distinction between an active media      producer and passive, consumerist audience is blurred, and transforming      possibilities for a more democratic and participatory media emerge.</li></ul><ul type="disc">  <li><strong>Dynamic knowledge creation and social      computing tools</strong> - These new tools are for working collaboratively, even at a distance, and are easier      to use and more commonly available. It&rsquo;s becoming more      common to attend conferences online or research information through and      contribute to project wikis.&nbsp; <span class="style1">For example, <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> is a 3-D virtual world entirely <a href="http://slfuturesalon.blogs.com/second_life_future_salon/2005/11/democracy_islan.html.">built and owned by its residents</a>. Since opening to the public in 2003, it has grown explosively and today is inhabited by nearly 100,000 people from around the globe. </span>Also, many young people who use online social network tools such as <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> have come to regard them as a part of their daily lives.</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/pa/digital-media/ideas.html"><img src="http://portal.nettrice.us/digital_media/sullytoolkit.jpg" width="200" border="0" class="float_right" /></a>In the spirit of these new media trends, the CTC VISTAs are not only using the Project's <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/pa/digital-media/">new media resources and tools</a> to collaborate with fellow VISTAs, but they are also sharing and teaching use of these open tools to their  youth participants    in each of their community technology and media programs. Here are a few specific examples: </p><ul>  <li><a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/christy_park/archives/2005_10.html">Christy Park</a> contributed several movie projects created by <a href="http://www.access-scat.org/">Somerville Community Access Television</a> youth that were showcased using <a href="http://portal.nettrice.us/bm/">Broadcast Machine</a>, software that was installed on the Digital Media with Youth website to easily publish the video files and create an Internet TV channel.&nbsp; Some of the youth projects were also made available as video podcasts or vodcasts that can be viewed on portable devices like iPods and through iTunes on computers.</li>  <li><a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/morgan_sully/">Morgan Sully</a> created an open source <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/pa/digital-media/ideas.html">Do-It-Yourself Digital Media Toolkit/CD-ROM</a> that included a small collection of free creative tools/software for youth (and adults) to manipulate images, record sound and upload/share their media. </li>  <li>Ryn Shane-Armstrong created his own video blog, <a href="http://www.5thtone.blogspot.com/">5thTone</a>, to explore participatory media and integrate the knowledge in his work at <a href="http://www.pcmtv.org/">Portland Community Media</a>. </li>  <li><a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/blog/molly_szymanski/">Molly Szymanski</a> has also contributed several movie projects created by youth at <a href="http://www.kacschgo.org/">Korean American Community Services</a> to the priority area's <a href="http://portal.nettrice.us/bm/">Digital Media Channel</a>. </li></ul><p><a href="http://s106678790.onlinehome.us/digital_creativity2.mov"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1340/463/200/dc.jpg" border="0" class="float_right" /></a>What's next? Recently, I  presented at the <a href="http://www.nmc.org/events/2006spring_online_conf/index.shtml">Online Conference on Personal Broadcasting</a> that was hosted by the <a href="http://www.nmc.org/">New Media Consortium</a> (NMC). Focused on <strong>Digital Creativity</strong>, my presentation not only highlighted my own experience and the experiences of this year's CTC VISTAS, but it also looked forward to new ways to create and distribute digital content through text, image, video/audio blogging, podcasting and other similar technologies. The next step of empowering youth in community and media centers needs to center on  non-traditional ways of telling and delivering or distributing personal stories (and art) using new media and methods.</p></body></html>
