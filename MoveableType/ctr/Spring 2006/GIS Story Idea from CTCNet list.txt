Subject: Re: [ctcnet] Could Google Earth revolutionize CTC work?

I often miss stuff, but there may be simpler approaches to some problems 
than full blown GIS. For:

	 "what are the closest 10 taco bells/CTCs to my house"

...All that is needed is the zip code of your house and some FOSS 
libraries. For most people maintaining a list of zip codes is happy side 
effect of keeping a database of addresses.

Some random libs

---> Does your model involve members responsible for their own GIS 
localities...for example, do you make a CTC responsible for updating and 
maintaining your database records for its offerings, or also for the 
community it serves? If not, I assume you pull these overlays from 
sources like the census? Could you give me a listing of some places to 
begin looking for data sources, other than the census?

---> I'm actually looking at the CiviCRM module now. I'm not sure I 
follow your point on the need for document conversion, though...could 
you explain the need for applications to convert data into interactive 
web-served content? Are you implying a system that provides CTC 
information the way a search engine would, from cached copies of content 
pertaining to each one, or am I missing the point entirely?

---> Agreed. Having our own databases is necessary if this project is 
going to continue in any real scope as a self-contained resource, and 
there are many arguments for having such a resource, free of reliance on 
Google or similar services. I also agree that the only way to work in 
this direction is for various entities to become regional authorities on 
the resources available in their communities, and also make those 
entities responsible for their data "playing nice" with a centralized 
repository for such data. By respository, of course, I don't necessarily 
mean a centralized database...I'm envisioning more of a portal site that 
directs queries to the appropriate database and associated site, with 
ownership of each localization resting with the organization that is an 
authority in that locality.

---> I agree. State divisions are the most logical, as eventually 
national divisions will be (since you mentioned a possible international 
scope to this project). Working together to develop this, with a 
division in responsibilities by state, but also with a commitment to 
working together to build into our projects some capacity for merging 
into an overarching national system would be ideal.
