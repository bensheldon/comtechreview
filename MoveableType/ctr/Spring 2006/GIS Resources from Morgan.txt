Hey Ben,

A few resources I came across:

The first one, utilizes a website called Flickr which is absolutely free:  

http://www.flickr.com/groups/memorymaps/ 


This group, using Google Earth, takes a satellite picture of their neighborhood and then annotates it.  You could do this and then have the group you're leading get a flickr account and add annotations to it (any one can add 'notes' to a picture).  

Flickr accounts for all students + one (1) satellite picture chosen by instructor + ability to annotate said image with flickr 'notes' = community 'memory map'

Just an idea, totally free.





SECOND RESOURCE:

http://www.greenmap.com/ymaps/ymindex.html

Taken off the CTC Resource website.  There'a  WHOLE BUNCH of stuff on there for community mapping.  Here's the link to the CTC Resource Directory with the 'community mapping' search activated:

http://www.ctcnet.org/resources/dir/index.php?t=display_link_search&having=467&cat=0&sid=723577919



THIRD RESOURCE:
Thie may be a bit of a 'dérive', but I myself, have always had an interest in mapping, particularly, the avant-garde art practice of 'psychogeography' and the dérive' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive).  It's become a more developed tool appropriated by urban studies/cultural theorists since it's inception during the mid 60's.  More info can be found on this search and may fortify the knowledge and awareness you seek to impart:

http://www.google.com/search?q=psychogeography&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official

As you'll see, it's got quite an international following of practioners and associations. 


Good luck,
Morgan

Ps. Keep in touch.  I'd be very interested to see where you take this....
