</table></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ltc.org">Lowell, MA Telecommunications Corporation (LTC)</a> 
prides itself on being the first center of its kind to open from the ground up 
as a combination traditional PEG (Public, Educational, and Government) access 
television station with a community technology center (CTC). Since 1994, LTC, 
committed to first-come, first-served telecommunication services to anyone in 
the community interested in expressing themselves and to providing training and 
access to the full range of media communication skills of the 21st century&#151;everything 
from video cameras to computers, from cable channels to the Internet, for community 
information and content production.</p>
<p> In the Summer of 1998, after four years of providing training and access to 
  thousands of residents and reaffirming its mission to &#147;Build Community 
  Through Technology&quot;&#151;rather than focus on the expansion and growth 
  of a central PEG access facility&#151;LTC chose to emphasize its role as a community 
  media and technology leader and public convener to decentralize its services 
  and work even more actively with the community. The <a href="http://www.lctc.org">Lowell 
  Community Technology Consortium</a> is the result of those efforts, a city wide 
  collaboration, consisting of 28 community-oriented organizations as of May 2001. 
<p> The Consortium came from a train-the-trainer class developed by LTC in the 
  summer of 1999, that in turn built on the spring organizing effort to develop 
  a proposal to the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OVAE/CTC/">U.S. Department 
  of Education Community Technology Centers</a> program.
<p> Despite not receiving the grant, formal meetings of the Consortium began in 
  October, 1999 (<a href="http://www.lctc.org/go/minutes/index.html">minutes of 
  recent meetings</a> can be found online). Initially holding small monthly meetings 
  concerned with needs assessment, mission statement forging, and setting up a 
  process for regular communication (monthly meetings, a listserv, and an underdeveloped 
  Web site), the group began to find its rhythm. It grew to eight, then to 10 
  and 12, and on to its <a href="http://www.lctc.org/go/minutes/index.html">present 
  membership</a>. 
<p> Meeting regularly with a defined mission helped spread the word. By March, 
  2000, the Consortium began to identify its core resource needs. Humans with 
  technical skill topped the list along with easier access to knowledge and technical 
  expertise. Faster and better equipment was not far behind. Along with Internet 
  connectivity issues, these have remained top concerns.
<p>&nbsp;

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Being able to identify our resource needs in a systematic way made it very 
  easy for LTC to jump at additional partnership and grant opportunities. In the 
  spring of 2000, Peter Miller, a long time CTCNet activist and community organizer, 
  was beginning work on a pilot program grant to the Corporation for National 
  Service. Drawing together a number of CTCs in the Boston Metro region, this 
  Americorps VISTA program would involve human resource development, training 
  and support for CTCs. Understanding that human resources were a key need allowed 
  LTC to jump on this partnership grant opportunity. 
<p> About this same time, LTC received word from the U.S. Department of Education 
  CTC Program that its Consortium proposal would be one of 70 projects funded 
  in the 2000 grant round. The grant had been one of the top-rated projects not 
  funded in the previous year. With $826K spread over a three-year period matched 
  one-to-one by additional community resources, it was clear that the beginning 
  efforts of the Consortium were going to get a rocket boost. Having already begun 
  the work of consortium building, the infusion of the U.S. Department of Ed funds 
  in May, 2000, made it easy for LTC to act quickly in the mobilization of the 
  rogrammatic activities detailed in its grant application. The grant also formalized 
  the Consortium and its activities, brought even more CBOs to the table, and 
  infused the project with additional much needed human resources&#151;a project 
  coordinator, technology coordinator, and funding for CTC trainers and site managers.
<p>
During the first year of the grant, concluded on April 30, 2001, the Consortium 
has been able to:
<ul>
  <li> hire a full-time project director and a full-time community technology 
    coordinator;</li>
  <li>convene and support the technology activities of 28 NPOs engaged in technology 
    education and access;</li>
  <li>purchase equipment and support the creation of five and expansion of eight 
    CTCs;</li>
  <li>provide staffing support for tech coordinators;</li>
  <li>provide basic curricula and skill assessment for those beginning programs;</li>
  <li>work with other community initiatives such as technology planning for NPOs;</li>
  <li>create a foundation for a community database;</li>
  <li>use convening authority to build local support for national endeavors (i.e., 
    <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org">CTCNet</a> and <a href="http://www.americaconnects.net">America 
    Connects Consortium</a>); and</li>
  <li>bring speakers and funders to the table with a strong collaborative identity.</li>
</ul>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>The forming of the Consortium has also allowed us to draw in additional resources 
  from other sectors as well. For example: 
<ul>
  <li> LTC and the Consortium have been actively involved with the University 
    of Massachusetts/Boston's College of Public and Community Service (CPCS) and 
    the national CTC VISTA project, the partnership that has brought five <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/whatsnew.html">AmeriCorps 
    VISTA</a> members to Consortium member agencies. This partnership has led 
    to work on a <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/gbbn.pdf">collaborative 
    grant</a> to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Technology Opportunities Program 
    (TOP). Also a vital link with the Center for Family, Work and Community (CFWC) 
    and the Department of Regional Economic and Social Development (RESD) at the 
    University of Massachusetts/Lowell is leading to the development of accredited 
    training opportunities for those looking to work within community media and 
    technology environments. LTC and the Consortium are playing a crucial link 
    <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/profdev.html">between these two UMass 
    campuses</a>. The Consortium has also formed a partnership with the UMass-Lowell 
    Computer Science Department, which has provided training space, student labor, 
    and connections to additional resources. </li>
  <li>The Consortium was also able to present 13 of its member organizations involved 
    in youth-based technology centers to PowerUp as a powerful model of a local/regional 
    partner. Two Consortium member agencies (CFWC and Recruitment Resources Consulting) 
    will become PowerUp sites within the next six months, with additional sites 
    to take root in the next three years.</li>
  <li>The Consortium has been able to leverage additional funds from the Verizon 
    Foundation and the HUD funded Enterprise Community Grant program to support 
    human resource development and training. A partnership with the Cisco Foundation 
    is in the beginning stages and one Consortium member agency, the United Teen 
    Equality Center, has garnered both cash and equipment resources from them. 
  </li>
  <li>The YWCA was able to leverage its membership in the Consortium and its funds 
    through the Department of Ed grant into matching resources for a Department 
    of Justice Seed Tech grant that helped them expand their partnership to work 
    with the local Weed and Seed program.</li>
</ul>
<p> The collaboration is in the process of trying to codify what goes on in our 
  centers in terms of information, knowledge and training, to create models for 
  ourselves and others to learn and grow from.
