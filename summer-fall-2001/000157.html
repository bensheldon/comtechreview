The University of Michigan <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu">School of Information</a> has been building capacity for the community technology movement for many years, through its <a href=" http://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msioverview.htm">master's degree program</a> project work, and collecting and publishing useful information resources.  In the past two years, these efforts have coalesced institutionally with the formation of a <a href=" http://www.si.umich.edu/cic">Community Information Corps</a> for current students and a Fellows program to support the professional development of graduates who do public interest work.  The <a href=" http://www.communitytechnology.org">Alliance for Community Technology</a> , a joint venture of the School and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, provides an umbrella for these and other activities at the intersection of academia, community serving organizations, and social investors.
</p><p>
The <a href=" http://www.si.umich.edu/cic/fellows-program.htm">Community Information Fellows program</a> is designed to encourage talented graduates to pursue public interest work, and to enhance their effectiveness in it.  Each Fellow receives professional development assistance in the form of mentoring and travel money, and a $5000 per year stipend for five years, so long as they pursue community and public interest work.  <a href="#fellowships">Six Fellowships</a> have been awarded, one last year and five this year.  First fellowship jobs range from support for regional workforce development to work with young adults in the Queens Public Library to producing a print and on-line newsletter from Nicaragua.  Funding for this year's Fellows came from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.  Funding for last year's Fellow came from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation through its support of the Alliance for Community Technology.  Over the next couple of years, we will be exploring the possibility of expanding the Fellows program to include master's degree students at other universities.

We would like to enlist the support of the broader technology movement in recruiting students and placing our graduates.  On the recruitment side, if you know college graduates who would like to build their capacity to contribute to the community technology movement, please urge them to consider the University of Michigan School of Information.  We especially encourage applications from former Americorps, Vista, and Peace Corps volunteers.  On the placement side, if you have a position that would be appropriate for someone with master's degree level skills (e.g., directing a community technology center, developing and evaluating programs, managing information collections, etc.) please post it through our <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/careers">careers web site</a>.  Summer internship postings as well as full-time positions are welcome.  There are <a href="#internships">nine internships</a> this summer.
</p><p>
While students are enrolled here, they can participate in our Community Information Corps.  At a weekly seminar, students present status reports about projects they are engaged in, meet visiting professionals in order to connect with national and international movements, and read and discuss works of political and social theory, to provide a larger context for understanding their work.  From a <a href="#projects">full list</a>, perhaps the most well-known that students and faculty have worked on over the past few years is the <a href=" http://databases.si.umich.edu/cfdocs/community/index.cfm">Community Connector</a> website, a national resource of information about community networks and community information systems.  As an outgrowth of this project, we are now developing infrastructure to support Knowledge Work Sites for particular sub-communities within the community technology movement.

Paul Resnick (<a href="mailto: presnick@umich.edu">presnick@umich.edu</a>) is Associate Professor at the University of Michigan School of  Information, where he coordinates the Community Information Corps. He  received the master's and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering and  Computer Science from MIT. His research focuses on SocioTechnical Capital, productive social relations that are enabled by the ongoing use of  information and communication technology.  His current projects include  analyzing and designing reputation systems that help maintain trust among  strangers on-line, and using photo-directories and email lists to increase  social ties in neighborhoods.  <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/~presnick/courses/winter01/575/syllabus.html#Schedule">Fall<a> and <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/~presnick/courses/fall00/575/syllabus.html#Schedule">winter-spring</a> course syllabi are available online.

<b><a name="projects">Full list of projects</a></b>
</p><p>
<a href="http://databases.si.umich.edu/cfdocs/community/index.cfm"> The Community Connector website</a> is a national resource of information about community networks and community information systems (Prof. Durrance).  As an outgrowth of this project, we are now developing infrastructure to support Knowledge Work Sites for particular sub-communities within the community technology movement (Profs. Atkins and Resnick).
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/">CHICO </a>, an ongoing project that captures cultural heritage materials and make them accessible to broader audiences.  Materials have ranged from a web-based history of underground railroad activity near Ann Arbor to a CD-ROM on the Yup'ik masks of the native people of southwestern Alaska and the Yukon (Profs. Frost and Holland).  
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.whothat.org">Who That</a>, tools and techniques for creating membership directories for neighborhoods, sports teams, and other groups, and research the effects these directories have on social capital in these groups (Prof.  Resnick).
</p><p>
In the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/kelloggcio">CIO Project</a>, SI students helped teenagers learn technology skills and use them in organizing community information, at the Flint Public Library and a community technology center in a public housing development (Profs. Durrance and Resnick).
</p><p>
On <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/features/hedstrom-s-africa.htm">South Africa trips</a>, students and faculty spent six weeks at the University of Fort Hare working on projects ranging from the archives of the ANC to e-commerce capabilities for local micro-enterprises (Profs. Hedstrom, Wallace, and Cogburn).
</p><p>
<a href="http://communitytechnology.org/asp-oss">ASPs and Open Source Software for non-profits</a> -- for several years, students provided information systems consulting to small non-profit organizations and explored some of the larger issues of how best to provide such services.  One outcome was a workshop and white paper on Application Service Providers and Open Source Software for the non-profit sector (Prof.  Cohen).
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.bettertogether.org">BetterTogether </a> grew out of <a href="http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/saguaro">the Saguaro Seminar on Civic Engagement</a>.  Visitors can download that group's report, read and contribute stories about new ways that Americans are connecting (Prof.  Resnick).
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.communitytechnology.org/aihec_vl/index.html">AIHEC Virtual Library initiative</a> is helping Native American Tribal Colleges to develop virtual digital libraries (Prof. Atkins).
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/libhelp">"How Libraries and Librarians Help" Project</a> examined how public libraries are providing community information.  A second part is developing tools that libraries can use to evaluate their activities (Prof. Durrance).
</p><p>
Through <a href="http://www.freshonline.net/">Fresh Online</a>, students developed prototype software for on-line grocery ordering in poor neighborhoods (Profs. Whatley and Resnick).
</p><p>
</p><p>

Since December, she has been assisting Professor Durrance on the How Libraries and Librarians Help Study.  She has recently accepted a position as Director of Neighborhood Information Services with the Citizens Committee for New York City.  Before graduate school, she spent time in rural Poland teaching English.  Karen's interest in Central/Eastern Europe developed while pursuing a BA in History at Wellesley College.  Her fascination with foreign cultures led to brief stints as a travel agent and a map contributor to Let's Go travel guides.  She also served as an Americorps team leader for an anti-hunger project in Los Angeles.  In her spare time Karen enjoys long-distance running when she is not surfing the web for the best travel deal to her next exotic destination.
