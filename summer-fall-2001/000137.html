</table>
<span class="subhead">Background</span>
<p>In December of 1999, the City of Atlanta embarked on an effort to redress the 
  digital divide. Mayor Bill Campbell charged Jabari Simama, Executive Director 
  of the Mayor&#146;s Office of Community Technology, with developing and implementing 
  a Community Technology Initiative for the municipality. The mission of the <a href="http://www.atlantacommunitytech.com">Atlanta 
  Community Technology (ACT) Initiative</a> is to &#147;ensure that technology 
  and new media improve the quality of life of Atlanta residents by providing 
  public access to training, equipment, information and knowledge.&#148; 
<p> Local business leaders, researchers from academic institutions, labor and 
  education specialists, and administrators of city agencies with relevant experience 
  in technology in low-income and under served communities of Atlanta were brought 
  together to form committees and development teams to assist in the planning 
  process. Drawing on the collective expertise of these diverse stakeholders, 
  the ACT Initiative developed a strategic plan and opened the first cyber center 
  in June, 2000, coinciding with the 9th annual conference of the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org">Community 
  Technology Centers&#146; Network.</a> 
<p><span class="subhead">Program Synopsis</span></p>
<p>
The community cyber centers are funded by $8.1 million generated from the city&#146;s 
Cable Franchise Agreement. Cable companies pay franchise fees to cities in exchange 
for using public spaces to lay their cables. The funding for the ACT Initiative 
was obtained in exchange for the city returning unused cable channels and foregoing 
a partially funded fiber optic municipal network that was part of the original 
Cable Franchise Agreement. The cyber centers have also received about $600,000 
in donations from private corporations. Partners run the gamut of public, private 
and non-profit organizations, such as SkillLearning.com, 3-Com, Earthlink, BellSouth, 
Gateway, the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library, Atlanta Public Schools and Hands-On-Atlanta. 
These partners provide hardware, software, Internet access, and training course. 
In addition, the city is seeking additional partnerships for future centers. 
<p> The ACT Initiative is ambitious, but as Microsoft CEO <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2000/10-18digitaldividends.asp">Bill 
  Gates stated</a>, &#147;just focusing on access to computers is a fairly narrow 
  way to look at these problems.&#148; This is perhaps the first and the largest 
  initiative funded by a major municipality. Some of the highlights: 
<ul>
  <li> Promotion and Community Education and Outreach</li>
  <li>Community Technology Centers</li>
  <li>&#147;One Stop Digital Shop&#148; Resource Center</li>
  <li>Basic Literacy and Computer Literacy Programming</li>
  <li>Job Skills Programming</li>
  <li>A Virtual City Hall</li>
  <li>A Virtual Community Portal</li>
  <li>Public-Private Partnerships</li>
  <li>Fundraising for Program Sustainability</li>
  <li>Challenge Grants for Best Practices</li>
</ul>
<p> The plan calls for 15 centers to become operational with an 18-month period. 
  <a href="#six">Six community centers</a> are open 
  as of May 2001 and each center houses 30-45 computers with Internet access. 
  The city will include at least one in south Atlanta with a bilingual emphasis 
  to give special help and encouragement to Spanish-speaking residents. Others 
  will include a special center for seniors, and another devoted to wireless communication 
  on the campus of Morris Brown College. 
<p>
At the cyber centers, any citizen can use the computers and take courses free 
of charge. To date, over 5000 residents have participated in the programs, one 
third of those are senior citizens. The centers offer two adult training courses: 
Introduction to Computers and Computer Applications, as well as After School and 
Summer Cyber Camp programs for teens. All courses are conducted in six weeks sessions. 
The cyber centers are staffed day and evening Monday through Friday with some 
centers providing hours on Saturday. <p>
The Virtual City Hall is currently under construction and will be brought online 
this fall and integrated with a Virtual Community Portal being funded by a $100,000 
grant from 3Com. The Virtual Community Portal will be a large Web site featuring 
content on the City of Atlanta, community and neighborhood services, neighborhood 
histories, homespun recipe books, and other forms of local content. Local residents 
enrolled in courses will help develop content for this Web site.<p> 
<p><span class="subhead"> Meeting Community Needs </span></p>
<p> The <a href="http://www.atlantacommunitytech.com/strategic_plan_summary.htm">intent 
  of the program</a> is to establish cyber centers in city-owned and designated 
  facilities within approximately two miles of every resident who lives in a community 
  where the majority of households are likely to be without computer and Internet 
  access. In Atlanta, the inner city population has the greatest need for access. 
  These target communities are best represented by the Atlanta Empowerment Zone 
  and linkage neighborhoods. The Atlanta initiative faces the challenge of developing 
  and implementing programs to serve communities in which over 60% of the adult 
  population functions at the lowest literacy level Adults at Level 1 literacy 
  cannot usually locate an intersection on a street map, locate two pieces of 
  information in an article, complete a social security card application, or calculate 
  total costs of a purchase from an order form.
<p>
Therefore, developing computer-based literacy in this community is an even greater 
challenge. How are those less literate to deal with the overwhelming amount of 
materials on the Internet? How are they to master the research skills necessary 
to seek out information? Perhaps more importantly, how are they to create content 
that is pertinent to local needs and interests? Clearly the initiative needs to 
be prepared to offer both computer literacy and computer-based literacy programs. 
<p>
Given all the challenges detailed in a fuller examination, it is nonetheless fitting 
to conclude on a hopeful note with a client&#146;s perspective of the program.
<p> &quot;I cannot simply express the gratitude I have for Mayor Bill Campbell 
  and the City of Atlanta staff that are primarily responsible for giving me an 
  opportunity to obtain the computer skills that have now become almost necessary 
  to obtain many entry-level jobs in today&#146;s job market. I&#146;d like to 
  offer my support and prayers that this program will remain intact for our future 
  generations.&#148;
