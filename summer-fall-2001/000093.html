<div class="category_title">Click on Over: A Profile of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Taunton (MA) Technology Center</div> <span class="posted">by Karen Zgoda</span>




<p>"I like the computer room a lot because when I first started to come here 
  I did not know anything about the computers. All the time Karen, Randy and 
  I always joke around that is what I like about the computer room it is interesting 
  and fun and I know a lot more about computers now than when I first came here 
  and that was two years ago." —Club member, age 11</p>
<p>Our computer room must have looked a lot different two years ago. At that 
  time the room enjoyed celebrated community status as a bingo hall at the <a
href="http://www.taunton.org/">Boys & Girls Club of Taunton</a>. Located 
  thirty miles south of Boston and twenty miles east of Providence, Taunton has 
  a population of roughly 55,000. A large number of senior citizens, Latinos 
  and Portuguese are at home here in our diverse community. The mission of our 
  Boys & Girls Club is to inspire and enable all young people, especially 
  those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, 
  responsible and caring citizens. In 1999-2000, we served nearly 1,300 children 
  aged 6-18. Approximately 65% of our daily participants come from low and moderate-income 
  households and are eligible for federally subsidized programs. Accordingly, 
  our yearly Club membership fee is $10.</p>
<p>With generous funding and software donations from both <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> and <a
href="http://www.shaq.com/">Shaquille O'Neal</a> our Club was chosen as a pilot 
  site for the <a href="http://www.bgca.org/">Boys & Girls Club</a> Operation 
  Connect technology program. <a href="http://www.powerup.org/">PowerUP</a>, 
  new computers, and <a href="http://www.americorps.org/">AmeriCorps *VISTA</a> 
  helped make our computer center fully operational in September 2000. An estimated 
  200 youth and community members utilize our walk-in computer center each week. 
  Our lab has over 70 computers divided into three sections for ages 6-9, 10-12, 
  and 13-18 to make supervision easier and encourage peer communication.</p>
<p>Our center structures activities that complement, not duplicate, school activities. 
  <a
href="http://www.powerup.org/powerup_online.shtml">PowerUP Online</a> has been 
  helpful in allowing easy access to such activities. Computer center staff, 
  technology mentors, and community volunteers provide general homework help and 
  technical assistance. Past projects include participation in the <a
href="http://www.freevibe.com/">Anti-Drug campaign</a> and celebration and consciousness-raising 
  of Hispanic Heritage Month, Black History Month, Women's History Month, Election 
  Day, and Earth Day. For Martin Luther King, Jr. Day computer center staff took 
  four children to a breakfast celebration at a local college. Children are taught 
  to use a variety of software programs for word processing, homepage building, 
  digital photography, graphic design, playing games, creating greeting cards, 
  research projects, email, and GIF animation. We have a game of the week contest 
  that doubles as entertainment and a general vehicle to get children interested 
  in computers. Our bulletin board showcased a gallery of stories and homework 
  assignments contributed by our members. In May our activities are focused on 
  digital arts and culture. In addition, our computer center is creating and 
  piloting an <a href="http://www.geocities.com/powerupepals">ePal program</a> 
  between other PowerUP labs across the country. Our goal for the ePal program 
  is to engage children in learning about other areas of the country, practicing 
  technology skills by undertaking structured and safe ePal correspondence with 
  children in other computer centers. We are very busy!</p>
<p>I was recently asked about leadership in our computer center and I would like 
  to share what I have gleaned from my service as an AmeriCorps *VISTA and PowerUp 
  Technology Project Coordinator. Know your community and let that knowledge 
  guide your activities. I landed in Taunton, and in Massachusetts in general 
  for that matter, one week before my VISTA service began. I placed a high priority 
  on learning about Taunton and its citizens. I attended local community meetings 
  and networked with others working on community technology issues. I read our 
  local <a href="http://www.uwgat.org/">United Way</a> needs assessment online. 
  Talk to people; technology will not replace a human connection. Get vocal. 
  Enthusiasm is contagious—pass it on. Set rules for the children and stick to 
  them, using a guiding phrase such as "You can do whatever you want in here 
  except break the rules." Think about what will appeal to your members. 
  What web sites are they exploring? What are their interests? What do they 
  want to learn about? Why do they come to your center, what are they hoping 
  to gain? How can you better provide it? Ask them. Your members will be your 
  best guide to running your computer center successfully. That is basically 
  what we did!</p>
<p>Most importantly, children are like sponges, absorbing information and knowledge 
  so quickly it boggles the mind. I have seen children learn and master the complex 
  Microsoft Front Page and Microsoft Publisher in one sitting. Children have 
  a natural inclination to learn, and technology offers a unique conduit to make 
  learning fun and exciting. From time to time our members benefit greatly from 
  enjoying the luxury of recreation in our lab. The technology and activities 
  stimulate initial interest in the computer lab; having caring, knowledgeable 
  adults, volunteers, and mentors in the lab will keep folks coming back for more. 
  All the technology in the world cannot replace the joy children feel when we 
  take an active interest in their lives. It is our responsibility to provide 
  and maintain that positive human experience as best we can, working like hell 
  to get things done, with technology as our backdrop.</p>
