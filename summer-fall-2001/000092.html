<div class="category_title">Community Networking on the Night Shift, Part Two: in which a Community Organizer Tries to Be a Techie</div> <span class="posted">by Anne McFarland</span>




<p>In <a href="http://www.civicnet.org/comtechreview/on_the_night_shift.htm">Part 
One</a> I detailed my failed attempts to become a policy wonk. The night shift 
simply did not leave enough time for the reading and studying that is the province 
of the policy wonks. So then I decided that I would rather be a techie than a 
community organizer. That&#146;s the job that impresses people; that&#146;s where 
the control is. I wanted to sit down at the computer and manage the site. I wanted 
to learn a skill that would bring me big money in the workplace. Furthermore, 
I wanted to quit wearing myself out on the organizing. There&#146;s always too 
much to do and too little time, and it&#146;s really hard to see progress.</P>
<p>
We had great techies at ACORN (Akron Community Online Resource Network) and at 
CH-UH.Net (Cleveland Heights-University Heights Community Network), and I loved 
to listen to them talk. I would make up little sentences with words that sounded 
cool. &#147;Anne drove the fast, wide SCSI bus into Hubba Doo&#146;s and ran in 
for a burger and a gigapop.&#148;<p>
The problem was that I had absolutely no idea what the words meant. I struggled 
with the age of technology, and if I hadn&#146;t had to function in a modern law 
library, I wouldn&#146;t have learned anything beyond word processing. In fact, 
word processing didn&#146;t come easy, except for the typing part of it. Being 
able to eliminate mistakes without using correction tape was a miracle, but the 
printer was a typewriter with major attitude. I don&#146;t want to think about 
how many reams of paper I&#146;ve wasted because I didn&#146;t set something properly, 
put letterhead in upside down, put envelopes in backwards, couldn&#146;t figure 
out how to stop a print job, etc.<p>
By now I&#146;ve moved through a number of word processing programs, and I have 
resented every change. I dread the words, &#147;We don&#146;t support that anymore.&#148; 
Apparently the idea is for the users to support the manufacturers by buying new 
software. My first program was Spellbinder, and my husband once asked me if I 
was ever going to read the manual. &#147;Not while you&#146;re in the house,&#148; 
I said.<p>
But I did read the manual, and I gained a sense of power. One night at dinner 
I said, &#147;Today I put text in the buffer; then I got it out and put it exactly 
where I wanted it.&#148;<p>
&#147;&#146;Way to go, Mom!&#148; said my son, who was born knowing how to do 
all this stuff. It took me years to realize that the Windows Clipboard was just 
an ordinary old buffer. I don&#146;t want to admit how much time I spent trying 
to open the Clipboard.<p>
But of course Spellbinder is long gone, along with a bunch of big floppies that 
I&#146;ll never be able to read again without resurrecting old technology, which 
by the way, we have in the attic. Then there was XyWrite III at work, which really 
wasn&#146;t bad. I could do neat things like snaking columns, and the manual was 
helpful. But then, of course, came XyWrite IV, with a manual that must have been 
written by the computer itself, because it bore no human touch.<p>
Then one day I sat down for my stint at the reference desk and came face to face 
with Windows95, which my techie wannabe boss had decided would be a chuckle for 
us to learn. I had to go to an all-day training session on a Saturday. The dos 
shell that I&#146;d used to manage my files was gone, and learning that had been 
a tour de force. Now there were little folders and icons for &#147;cut&#148; and 
&#147;paste&#148;&#151;real techie language. But I learned Word, yea even up to 
Word 2000, which is a miracle for someone who approached this with the mantra 
&#147;In the beginning was Word, and Anne was sore afraid.&#148;<p>
There were still more packages to learn. For some reason PowerPoint came easily, 
after I&#146;d gone very slowly through the tutorials that our tech support person 
had put on the ref desk computer. But Access was something that I didn&#146;t 
get very far with. I&#146;m not even trying Excel.<p>
There was one big area left, and my chance at it came with early retirement. I 
would learn how to design web pages! I had the art background, and this time I 
would prevail. I worked on Composer, I worked on FrontPage, and I even worked 
on the web wizards. I never understood the architecture. I just couldn&#146;t 
develop a schematic that worked for me. I&#146;d put up a personal web page with 
a wizard, and I couldn&#146;t even figure out how to transfer an image to the 
page. I went back to cheat sheets. I already had a bunch of them for the email 
programs that my husband and son had installed as well as any other routines that 
I didn&#146;t understand. 
<p>Finally I faced the truth. At a Saturday work session I was trying to teach 
  someone how to use our community calendar, and I saw that she was way ahead 
  of me. I called the techies over and made a public pronouncement that I was 
  a technomoron and wasn&#146;t even going to try to learn more than the pitiful 
  amount I&#146;d accumulated thus far.<p>
  So much for the glory. So much for any transferable skill, like web design, 
  that might actually earn money in the workplace. I&#146;d already gotten a part-time 
  job in a law library, and it would be all that I could do to stay current with 
  the legal databases. Legal reference is my job, not technology. Funny how neither 
  reference librarians nor community organizers have high-paying jobs!<p>
  Then I remembered that years ago my son had said to me, &#147;Mom, how can you 
  run ACORN when you can&#146;t ftp a file?&#148;
<p> I&#146;d replied, &#147;We&#146;ve got techies; what we need are community 
  organizers.&#148; I should have listened to my own voice. You&#146;ve got to 
  do what you can do. Techie and community organizers are a team, and you play 
  on the side for which you have some ability. Even if you&#146;re tired. Even 
  if the reporter who left you a message never returns your calls. Even if there 
  is too much stuff in the pile on your desk. And even if you wish you&#146;d 
  been born with other abilities.
