<h3 class="title">CTCNet in the Lead</h3>

<H4>Origin and History</H4>
<TABLE align=right border=0 cellPadding=5 cellSpacing=5 height=346 width=290>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><IMG border=0 height=299 name=leadership src="/summer-fall-2001/img/leadership.jpg" width=288> </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD><I><FONT size=2>Portraits from the 2000 Leadership Institute: (top to bottom) Michael Roberts (United Neighborhood Houses, New York City) and Stephanie McIntyre (TechnoTots, Perth Amboy, NJ), Lorraine Treadwell (Civic Association Serving Harlems), Karen Chandler, Director CTCNet, Davis Park (Little Tokyo CTC, Los Angeles), Kris Smith (the Nonviolence Project, Miami, FL), Roger Holt (Parents, Let's United for Kids, Billings, MT).</FONT></I></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The Community Technology Centers' Network Leadership Institute (LDI) was conceived with the mission of expediting start-up for new centers, building capacity for existing affiliate centers, and creating opportunities for more advanced centers to apply their expertise in building a stronger movement for community technology education. Begun in 1999 with a pilot collaboration program with the National Urban League, the initial three-day institute brought together twelve CTCNet affiliate center Directors from centers ranging from New Orleans, LA to Rocky Mount, NC. The focus was to link organizational planning and decision-making to their specified client needs and program objectives, identify appropriate community and professional collaborations, and develop achievable action plans for program and financial sustainability.</P>
<P>The Institute showcased the diversity of learning environments and types of CTCs that make up the Network by taking place at local centers in the Boston area. The Computer Clubhouse at the Computer Museum, the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, La Alianza Hispana and the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts each highlighted their own learning models and program problems and successes. </P>
<P>In 2000, the LDI incorporated two key recommendations from the 1999 pilot evaluations - that future trainings would benefit from being longer and that the "action planning activity" should be emphasized. Thus the LDI was expanded to a six-month program, beginning with a three-day intensive workshop in Boston and including sponsored attendance at the CTCNet National Conference. Major topic areas included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Leadership Competencies 
<LI>Strategic Planning and SWOT (Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats) Analysis 
<LI>Center Operations 
<LI>Technology Integration Planning 
<LI>Strategic Operations Plans (SOPs) </LI></UL>
<P>Another twelve participants from California, Montana, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York, Florida, and Massachusetts were divided into four teams, each assigned a mentor who is an established leader within the CTCNet affiliate base. Mentors were chosen whose selection was based on experience, expertise, and regional proximity to facilitate face-to-face contact during the six-month follow through. Participants developed strategic operational plans, starting the process in March, presenting drafts in June at the CTCNet National Conference in Atlanta where they practiced taking a leadership roles by representing the LDI 2000 class to their colleagues, and completing final products at the end of the Institute in August.</P>
<H4>Conclusions and Implications for LDI 2001</H4>
<P>In addition to the specific challenges that center staff face in maintaining effective operations, center leaders can become drained as the stewards of these organizations that operate in a highly competitive, quick-changing environment. Six months after the 1999 LDI pilot, four of the original twelve participants had left their centers; after one year, another four were gone. Frequent burn out and brief tenures for leaders of non-profit organizations are not specific to community technology, but the problem is exacerbated at CTCs which are excellent training grounds from which talented, ambitious leaders spring into more lucrative for-profit sector positions, or into private consulting. In response, the LDI 2001 has built in sessions on succession planning so that current leaders can apply strategic thinking not only to immediate operations, but also to longer-range organizational support and changes.</P>
<P>The LDI has changed in number and format in 2001, too. Instead of bringing participants from around the country to Boston, numerous Institutes are taking place in different cities around the country with local participants. In March, 80 people from CTCs across the country attended Leadership Development Institutes (LDIs). With the support of AT&T and the America Connects Consortium (ACC), CTCNet conducted four programs in empowerment zones in Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC. </P>
<P>Five "hot topics" in community technology leadership have been chosen as the focus of this year's LDI program: personal leadership and management skills, succession planning for leadership transitions, technical plans, innovative fundraising strategies, and community collaborations. Two-day programs have included speaker sessions, learning exercises with their mentor groups, case studies discussing how CTCNet members handle situations of succession, technical planning, and difficult community relationships, and planning individual follow-up projects. Organizations in the midst of leadership transitions are creating recruitment plans. CTCs desiring to branch into multimedia programs are revising technical plans, adjusting for the new hardware, software, training, and support requirements. Board members of smaller CTCs are dedicating themselves to working more closely with their executive directors and being actively engaged in comprehensive strategic planning.</P>
<H4>Highlights from March 2001 LDIs </H4>
<P><B>Chicago</B> - Coordinated by Olomenji O'Connor at the <A href="http://www.thefic.org">Charles Hayes Family Investment Cente</A>r, the program included a keynote presentation on leadership by Bob Schout from the Support Center of Chicago. Bob led the mentor groups in an exercise that discussed the skills and organizational challenges of good managers and good leaders. Carl Davidson claimed it gave him the "leadership fuzzies."</P>
<P><B>New York City</B> - Coordinated by Gregory Mills at the <A href="http://www.harlem.cc">Harlem Media Center</A>, the program keynote by Stephanie Creaturo of NpowerNY gave a comprehensive overview of the funding process from the perspective of CTC development and program staff, board members, the Executive Director, and the funder. Leading the group in an exercise to develop a plan for how a CTC would match a grant one-to-one within a year's time for a new program idea, Stephanie highlighted key questions CTCs must answer before pursuing any new funding opportunity.</P>
<P><B>Pittsburgh</B> - LDI participants had a unique opportunity to tour the Community House with Director Wayne Peck and Technology Director Janet Leo. Wayne demonstrated how young people are learning interview and presentation skills with video technology in their new Mac lab, and participants viewed several short videos of "best practice" projects on how young people have demonstrated what they learn.</P>
<P><B>Washington DC</B> - Coordinated by Evelyn Frazier at the <A href="http://www.mhcdo.org">Marshall Heights Community Development Organization</A>, this LDI included a focus on partnerships with Todd Endo of Urban Alternatives discussing how the diverse population growth of Arlington, VA is giving Urban Alternatives many new, creative opportunities in this arena. Todd discussed the stages of a partnership with examples of how to orchestrate their development, especially with local schools. According to one evaluation, Todd's presentation was "beyond awesome." Another said, "This could be a major help in building better relationships."</P>
<P>CTCNet plans to place all the resource tools from the March LDIs on-line. Educational Development Center (EDC), a principle partner of ACC, is now working on compiling the materials and creating an on-line institute. CTCNet plans to hold six more LDIs between August and next April in the empowerment zones of Boston, Oakland, Rio Grande Valley, the Mississippi Delta, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Keep posted to the <A href="http://www.ctcnet.org">CTCNet</A> and <A href="http://www.americaconnects.net">ACC</A> web sites and e-mail lists for details. 
<HR>
<P>Karen Chandler is CTCNet Executive 
Director; Sarah Petrin was the LDI Coordinator for the March sessions.</P>

</table>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dekalb.k12.ga.us/ftrc/index.shtml">Family Technology 
  Resource Centers (FTRC) Program</a> consists of 14 community technology centers 
  operated by the DeKalb County School System (DCSS) in Atlanta, GA. The model 
  program is an outreach and technology diffusion initiative developed and maintained 
  by the DCSS to encourage the use and awareness of Information and Communication 
  Technologies (ICTs) by under-served populations. Initiated in 1996, the program 
  has been highly successful in sustaining program activities through active participation 
  from an array of significant community stakeholders including members of the 
  DeKalb County School Board, teachers, parents, community members, funders, and 
  other community partners. DeKalb County's FTRC program has been recognized 
  as a model community technology program in the United States. In October 1996, 
  President Clinton applauded those families who transitioned from welfare to 
  work after completing the FTRC's PC Skills, Jobs Training, and Employment 
  Skills classes. In November 1998, President and Mrs. Clinton honored the FTRC 
  at an official ceremony in the White House as an exemplary after school and 
  community education program.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
</p>
<h3>FTRC Program Overview</h3>
<p>According to the 1990 U.S. Census, DeKalb County's median income in zip code 
  30316 where most of the FTRCs are located was $23,285, compared to a national 
  median income of $35,894. In 1999, DeKalb County had the fastest growing poverty 
  rate (15.7%) in Georgia. The DCSS is a 106,000-student school district with 
  122 schools – the second largest school system in the South, behind the Miami/Dade 
  School District in Florida. More than half the students qualify for free or 
  reduced lunch, and the student body is 86.5 percent minority population. With 
  the underlying principle that education cannot exist in a closed social system 
  since all students are citizens of the larger community, the goals of the FTRCs 
  are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide equal access to computer training to all segments of the community;</li>
  <li>enhance parent knowledge of computing skills so they can help support their 
    children's education and improve their own employment opportunities; 
    and</li>
  <li>strengthen partnerships among key stakeholders including schools, parents, 
    businesses, and community organizations. </li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these goals, DCSS keeps school facilities and community centers 
  open after traditional school hours to provide computer-based learning opportunities 
  for all community members. Each center maintains records on its users, and student 
  data is related to parental participation at the FTRCs,<br>
  Started with just one FTRC in 1996, the program has grown to include 14 centers 
  distributed throughout the school system. All 14 FTRCs are available to DeKalb 
  County students, their parents, senior citizens, and other interested residents, 
  such as parents of private school students. The centers offer courses delivered 
  through interactive multimedia technologies that allow each student to learn 
  personal computer skills, job-related technical skills, basic and advanced literacy 
  skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, and a variety of government regulations 
  related to the workplace. The course offerings include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PC skills: lessons in using a PC, Microsoft Windows, word processing, spreadsheets, 
    databases, and presentation tools.</li>
  <li>Basic skills: lessons in reading, math, writing, science, history, and language 
    arts.</li>
  <li>Technical and vocational skills: lessons in keyboarding, basic literacy, 
    GED completion, and SAT/ACT preparation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each course offered through the FTRCs takes between eight and 10 hours to complete; 
  an entire curriculum takes between 53 and 85 hours. FTRCs provide trainees with 
  access to "training facilitators" who answer questions, assist participants, 
  and track attendance and course completion. The centers also provide childcare 
  to parents with children too young to participate in FTRC activities. Children 
  under age seven are entertained with age-appropriate activities, and children 
  over age seven participate in computer-related activities that augment classroom-based 
  instruction.</p>
<h3>Implementation of the FTRC Program</h3>
<p>The FTRCs grew out of preliminary results of a pilot program to train teachers 
  to effectively use technology in the classroom established by DCSS in the early 
  1990s. Dr. Edward Bouie, Jr, initiated the program in three elementary schools 
  in August 1995. The schools selected were specially categorized by the DCSS 
  Superintendent as Special Instruction Program (SIP) schools having low-test 
  scores and a downward trend. Initially the training program focused on four 
  courses that addressed using a PC, Windows, and Microsoft Office products. Courses 
  took place in after regular school hours until February 1996. An outside evaluation 
  team from Clark Atlanta University found positive results for the effectiveness 
  of the training program and courseware, results Bouie reported back to the Board, 
  garnering their further support for the training program. The School Board decided 
  to implement the teacher training program system-wide at a cost of 5.5 million 
  dollars with the goal of training DCSS's 7,500 teachers and 1,500 staff.</p>
<p>In the vendor's contract with the DeKalb County School System for purchase 
  of the pilot program software, <a href="http://www.itclearning.com">ITC Learning</a> 
  offered a statement that if the pilot was successful and if the Board decided 
  to further implement the training program, they would provide funding for a 
  community outreach project. Bouie defined this role as the FTRC program and 
  developed a vision for how it could be implemented in a 1995 concept paper, 
  "Family Technology Resource Centers: Serving Parents, Students, and Community." 
  In this paper, Bouie explained the reason for involving the community in K-12 
  education:<br>
  "Schools cannot live apart from the community in which they reside. Communities 
  of learning are vital for the stability and growth of all citizens. Stable communities 
  working together to advance individual's skills in a technology-rich andinformation-driven 
  atmosphere will provide the cornerstone to a citizenry ready to participate 
  in the global economy."</p>
<p>Realizing his need for assistance in implementing the program, Bouie brought 
  on board Dr. Mindy DiSalvo, who in April, 1996, began writing a proposal to 
  the Georgia Partnership in Education (GPEE), an organization that brings business, 
  education and government to the table to advocate for educational improvement 
  in Georgia; the proposal for $75,000 was successfully funded. In June, the FTRC 
  received its first funding and began plans for program implementation. They 
  decided to place the first center at Gresham Park Elementary School, as Wendolyn 
  Norris, the school principal, was highly motivated and excited about the program's 
  possibilities. </p>
<p>In August and September of 1996, Bouie, DiSalvo, and Norris finalized the logistics 
  of running an FTRC at an elementary school. Using previous research on adult 
  learners that showed adult learners learn differently from K-12 students and 
  need to study a subject at least four hours per week, they developed course 
  schedules. They established all of the rules and guidelines and decided to set 
  up a Local Advisory Board for each center, so that each site could make its 
  own decisions based on its particular community's needs, values, and interests. 
  Realizing the need for large amounts of staff time, Norris proposed that the 
  only fee for participation would be that each FTRC user volunteer 30 hours back 
  to the center or school – an idea that has become a significant catalyst 
  for furthering other school goals at all 14 existing FTRCs. Norris interviewed 
  potential staff for the center, with an emphasis on hiring local people from 
  the community the center serves. </p>
<p>In the five years since the FTRC program began at Gresham Park Elementary School, 
  the school has realized an increase in parental involvement from five percent 
  in 1995 to 88 percent in 2000 and of the approximately 500 students at the school, 
  167 are involved in the FTRC in some way.<br>
  The vendor's commitment to fund a community outreach program in its proposal 
  to the DeKalb County School System resulted in $250,000 used to fund the payroll 
  for staff at three new centers, opened in 1997 after successful implementation 
  of the first program at Gresham Park in the prior year. Following the School 
  Board's requirement that no school funds be used for FTRC staff, the FTRCs 
  continued to leverage all available school resources as DCSS opened additional 
  centers in the following years.</p>
<h3>Program Outcomes</h3>
<p>Each center maintains records on its users, and student data is related to 
  parental participation in the FTRCs. In <br>
  the five years since program implementation, the DeKalb County School System 
  reports for each school with an FTRC</p>
<p>· school-wide Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) and National Percentile Rank 
  (NPR) increased<br>
  · increased individual student achievement using Iowa Test of Basic Skills 
  (ITBS) total reading and total math scores<br>
  · improved school attendance (including decreased tardiness)<br>
  · decreased student discipline referrals<br>
  · increased parental involvement at school activities and functions<br>
  · increased parental support in home-school partnership contracts<br>
  · increased parental involvement in homework<br>
  · increased home-school contact<br>
  · expanded partnerships between schools and businesses<br>
  · expanded services offered at school during non-traditional hours<br>
  · expanded hours spent on-task learning for K-12 students<br>
  · improved job status (raises and promotions) for parents, and<br>
  · employment for those previously unemployed. <br>
  <br>
  The FTRCs have to date trained more than 12,500 participants (7,500 teachers, 
  3,000 community members, 2,000 others) over five years. The FTRCs maintain usage 
  at 100 percent of their capacity, and currently have a waiting list of over 
  2,000 community members.</p>
<p>Employers have continuously reported that the "job ready" applicants 
  who have graduated from the program are successful. Four FTRC business partners 
  have recognized the skills of the FTRC graduates and have hired them. One metropolitan 
  Atlanta employer has hired over 20 FTRC graduates and has offered to pay for 
  the CompTIA+ Certification Exam (a novice-level certification for computer technicians) 
  for FTRC graduates, and when they pass, employ them. Fortune 500 companies, 
  major hospitals and health centers, school districts, and government agencies 
  in Atlanta have also hired graduates. Perhaps the greatest tribute to the FTRC 
  program is the graduation ceremony celebrating the participants and their families 
  each quarter. For many of the participants, this is the first time they have 
  ever graduated from an educational program. Graduation programs have grown from 
  the first class of 18 in February, 1997, to over 500 graduates this April. </p>
<h3>Case Observations and Conclusions: </h3>
<p>Key factors influencing the program's success and conclusions include: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ongoing reinforcement (rather than a "one-shot") effort in formulating 
    a plan for any participant to be welcomed back to the centers on an ongoing 
    basis for continual learning opportunities.</li>
  <li>Realistic Identification of Nature and Needs of Target Constituencies Mentoring 
    and Training by Peers.</li>
  <li>Leverage Existing School Resources </li>
  <li>Community Buy-in and Strategic Partnership</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the impetus for the FTRC program came from leadership within the school 
  system, program administrators focus on grassroots involvement at a variety 
  of levels: requiring participants to volunteer 30 hours back to the FTRCs; hiring 
  qualified FTRC graduates as trainers for other community members; and establishing 
  local Advisory Boards at each site. The successful outreach of public schools 
  into the community for purposes other than the traditional educational objectives 
  reflects a partnership of school and community, drawing upon the resources (training 
  and technology) of the public system to achieve synergistic benefits beyond 
  the traditional orientation of the educational system toward in class-student 
  learning. In the case presented here it appears that the impetus for program 
  development was the result of a combination of an environment "suitable" 
  for change, participation of various stakeholders, and the ability of key change 
  agents both internally and externally to draw upon resources to "leverage" 
  a policy initiative.<br>

<h3 class="title">About This Issue</h3>

<p>We're extremely excited to be back and to have a new home for the Review at the UMass/Boston College of Public and Community Service (<A href="http://www.civicnet.org/comtechreview">back issues are available online</A>). Our enthusiasm is matched by our awe at the speed of development and change. Since the last issue and announcing the call for submissions for this one, we've learned an immense amount. Here are three key points we'd like to pass along. 
<P>First, we've learned a lesson about "leadership in the community technology movement." Although we've put together another very full issue, we know we have barely touched on our topic. There are profiles and descriptions of lots of projects we get completed - a Morino Institute paper, PolicyLink's analysis of community development, profiles of Cincinnati and other municipalities, updates from lap.org and the National Recreation and Parks Association, best practices and resources from HUD's Neighborhood Network program-and much that we confess we do not even know to ask about.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, we think we have made some a good effort to sketch out and report on a number of important sites on the map on community technology. Without providing too detailed a commentary on our table of contents, we've got a round-up of our key organizational sponsors, the Community Technology Centers' Network (CTCNet) and the Association for Community Networking (AFCN). You'll find asides about related programs through America Connects, Power Up, the Alliance for Community Media, and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. There's a special take on the extensive digital divide resources associated with AmericaCorps*VISTA and the Corporation for National Service, with useful contributions towards grasping what's happening in the worlds of technology assistance to the nonprofit sector, community technology program development in higher ed, and in the public policy arena which affects everything.</P>
<P>Second, one of the definitive things we're learning is that major developments and transformations, which continue to take place within specific organizations and institutions, are also importantly being measured on municipal and regional scales-that's the lesson of our profiles on Atlanta, Georgia; Lowell, Massachusetts; and Seattle, Washington. As grassroots, municipal, corporate and foundation and association efforts converge, mapping efforts to grasp and coordinate further development become basic for our work more and more.</P>
<P>Finally, as we've come to develop the hard copy print journalism medium and explore the possibilities of its integration into online resources over the last several years, we want to step on to the next rung of the ladder. While you'll find only a limited number of web sites explicitly listed in the hard copy version of these pieces, we've encouraged our contributors to make very liberal use of hypertext links which you can see by the color of the print in contrast to the regular black text. When you go to the text in our online edition, you'll be able to click on the links that you care to explore in depth to your own liking. You'll be able to select, too, on extended versions of some articles which the contributors edited for the print version. We've really not even begun to convey the art that community technology has created, and we'll look forward to doing that in the coming issues. - <A href="mailto:peterm@igc.org">Peter Miller</A> & <A href="mailto:rciville@civicnet.org">Richard Civille</A><BR></P>

<p>Thanks to a grant from State Street's Global Philanthropy Program, CTCNet is 
  excited to begin implementing a new initiative to support CTCs in the Boston 
  Metropolitan area - a pilot for a Floating Help Desk, an on-call technical support 
  service exclusively for CTCs. </p>
<p>The program has goals to: identify strategies and test approaches for improving 
  the operation and service provision capabilities of CTCs; address centers' day-to-day 
  technical problems in real or near-real time; reduce the learning/development 
  curve of centers and center staff; and assist with the sustainability activities 
  of centers and center facilities (e.g. technology planning and grant research).</p>
<p>The pilot will target 10-12 CTCNet affiliate centers in the Boston area to 
  undertake a three-fold program:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Do a Needs Assessment</b> - to determine what specific issues should 
    be addressed by the State Street project. Surveys, interviews and site visits 
    will help assess and prioritize issues to be addressed such as funding, staffing, 
    training, locating available resources, and planning successful activities/programs/curricula. 
    Currently, CTCNet is considering a combination of several techniques for the 
    needs assessment. Additionally, CTCNet will create a module for 
    a needs assessment procedure based on this identifying process, to allow centers 
    or other groups to perform them efficiently and regularly.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Establish a Floating Help Desk</b> - to provide on-call, continuous technical 
    support to the pilot centers with the expertise to troubleshoot hardware and 
    software problems, instruct staff on tips for improved equipment maintenance, 
    and advise centers in other technical matters, such as network options and 
    hardware purchases. The Help Desk will be staffed by volunteers including 
    corporate volunteers and technology interns (e.g., college students, high 
    school students, VISTAs, and CTC graduates) and paid technicians.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Design a Technology Internship &amp; Corporate Volunteers Program</b> 
    - to complement the paid staff of the pilot centers by providing diverse skill 
    sets for centers and to help operate the Floating Help Desk. </li>
</ol>
<p>CTCNet hopes to complete the pilot stage of the project over the next year, 
  with the intention of expanding its services beyond the initial participants 
  to include all CTCNet affiliates in the Metropolitan Boston area. Through its 
  participation in the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/gbbn.pdf">Greater 
  Boston Broadband Network</a> CTCNet plans to expand the multi-media components 
  and resources of the project.<br>

<h3 class="title">The Community Technology Toolbox Grows into a Garage: How to Tune-up your Strategy</h3>

<center><img src="/summer-fall-2001/img/grunwald-wilcox.jpg"></center>
<P>
As the Community Technology (CT) movement mushrooms, the small toolbox
of models once known simply as community access networks, community
technology centers, community web sites, and training classes has grown
exponentially. <br>
<br>
The little toolbox has now grown into a rather messy and poorly
organized garage. Let's take a peek. <br>
<br>
Over here we see some valuable tools that do very similar things but
seem to have different labels like CTCs, 21st Century learning centers,
Neighborhood Networks centers, media centers, etc. That&#8217;s
confusing. Over there we find a collection of training curricula
tools but with specialized attachments for youth, women, seniors,
immigrants, job seekers, etc. At intervals we see these tall cabinets
with labels such as schools, colleges, business, government agencies
(perhaps we should call them silos) that contain an excellent array of
useful implements, but what&#8217;s this? &#8230; most of these cabinets seem to be
locked. Still, there are lots of gems here: a mobile lab, a set
of wireless solutions, a nifty little computer-based family literacy
program. This garage just need some tidying up, a labeling
system, and some keys (lets call them incentives) to unlock those
silos. And you know, many of these tools don&#8217;t work too well for people
with disabilities. That needs to be fixed, too. But all in all, this
garage is chock full of treasures. For community leaders,
it&#8217;s hard to know where to start.<br>
<br>
The choices are daunting&#8212;but also offer immense opportunities:<br>
&#8226; to help community leaders think more strategically <br>
&#8226; to promote wider participation and &#8220;buy-in&#8221; by
diverse and excluded populations <br>
&#8226; to customize these tools to meet specialized local
needs and capitalize on local assets <br>
&#8226; to promote more integrated strategies based on
partnerships and collaborations<br>
<br>
Choosing and applying these tools presents a number of challenges as
well:<br>
&#8226; Disempowerment. Savvy grassroots leaders often feel
uncomfortable around technology issues. Consequently they give up power
--to &#8220;boxes and wires&#8221; enthusiasts or economic developers pushing a
high tech corporate agenda.<br>
<br>
&#8226; &#8220;The Candy Store Syndrome&#8221; Community leaders are
rarely aware of all the tools available. Therefore when they see
a high profile model they determine they want some of that &#8220;shiny
candy&#8221; &#8211; whether or not it makes sense for their own community.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&#8226; The &#8220;Silos&#8221;. In most communities
technology resources tend to cluster intra-institutionally around
discrete funding streams but may not be open to all citizens.<br>
<br>
&#8226; No one is responsible for a 360 degree view. Because
institutional &#8220;silos&#8221; don&#8217;t publicize their resources no one is aware
of&nbsp; all the tools.<br>
<br>
Need help? Here are six guidelines to improve community
decision-making around technology:<br>
<br>
1. Survey your local CT garage. Know the resources
and tools that already exist or are planned for your local
community. See <a
 href="http://www.makingthenetwork.org/tool/blocks.htm">the checklist
of CT building blocks</a>. <br>
<br>
2. Map your CT Assets. Use GIS techniques to
create a visual display of access sites, computer labs, training
programs and other geographic based assets &#8211; whether or not they are
currently open to the public.<br>
<br>
3. Empower citizens to select appropriate CT tools
based on local needs. Community support and &#8220;buy-in&#8221; to tech
initiatives evolve naturally with participation in early
decision-making. See &lt;<a
 href="http://www.makingthenetwork.org/pgame/index.htm">http://www.makingthenetwork.org/pgame/index.htm</a>&gt;
for games and simulations developed by colleagues David Wilcox and Drew
Mackie of Making the Net Work which help with this.<br>
<br>
4. Find out what works &#8211; and what doesn&#8217;t. When
possible, buy the battle-scared pioneers a beer and probe for the
real-life problems that didn&#8217;t show up in the case studies. <br>
<br>
5. Seek a balanced approach. Don&#8217;t make all
your CT investments in one section of the garage. Infrastructure
and hardware tend to be high-powered vacuums and suck up available
funding. Favor people as much as technology.<br>
<br>
6. Participate in the CT networks. Stay current
with the latest tools through discussion lists, e-newsletters, web
casts, and conferences. Pay special attention to the
techno-realists that speak from solid experience and activate your
hype-antenna.<br>
<br>
Selecting the right tool for the job is getting more and more complex,
as the choices continue to grow. Today a garage; tomorrow Home
Depot? But remember that Community Technology is ultimately
not about the technology and what it can do, but about the needs of
communities and the ways technology can be used strategically to meet
those needs.<br>

<h3 class="title">The Promise &amp; Potential - Helping Nonprofits Technology Turbocharge!</h3>

<p>Over the past few years there has been a virtual explosion of support organizations and resources set up for nonprofits interested in leveraging the power of technology. At the same time, funders, Nonprofit Technology Assistance Providers (NTAPs) and the CTC community are realizing the importance and mutual interests they have in serving nonprofits and communities. It is truly a time of great activity, promise and potential for nonprofits interested in leveraging technology to forward their mission. 
<P>The constellation of nonprofit related technology initiatives is almost dizzying to consider. Collaborations are sprouting all over the place. Funders, management support providers, and NTAPs are bringing their respective communities closer together. A virtual goldmine of online resources continues to proliferate. New networks are being built on the national, state and local levels. Tried and true support models are being adopted more widely and creative new approaches expand and improve on the exiting methods. Software innovations and new application service providers (ASPs) are finally being customized to meet nonprofit needs.</P>
<P>Below are mini-profiles of five different initiatives. These represent a mix of initiatives to give you a sense of the breadth of activity. In no way is this meant as a comprehensive list as there are many more organizations deserving equal attention. Following the profiles, there is a list of links to others who are doing exceptional work in the field. Happy Learning!</P>
<H4><A href="http://eriders.org/list.html">Circuit Riders Network</A></H4>
<P>A Circuit Rider is someone who provides technology assistance to the nonprofit sector. The help a Rider gives varies from helping to set up a local area network (LAN) to coaching an Executive Director to advocate for technology funding to the board. Part technology cheerleader, evangelist and skilled technologist, Riders come in many forms. In some cases foundations fund several Riders to service their grantees. Riders sometimes are housed within existing technology support provider organizations. Many Riders operate as independent consultants and in some cases a community of nonprofits might pool resources and hire a Rider. The circuit riding community grew out of the U.S. progressive social change and environmental movements, as well as other technology assistance efforts. The Riders hold an annual conference, The Round-Up, and also currently engage in a strategic planning process to determine some coordinated future actions.<BR>The best way to connect with the Rider community is to go to their web site and subscribe to the Riders Discussion List.</P>
<H4><BR><A href="http://www.nten.org">National Technology Enterprise Network (NTEN)</A></H4>
<P>Several years ago a group of non-profit leaders, technology assistance providers, and funders discussed ways to help nonprofits better deploy advanced technology. This led to development of the National Strategy for Non-Profit Technology (NSNT), which in turn led to the launch of NTEN. The NTEN vision, as stated in its Business Case Statement, reads: &#8220;NTEN aspires to a world where all non-profits, regardless of size, can skillfully and confidently use information technology to meet community needs, whether for responsive and humane social services, social equity and opportunity, a healthy natural environment, or the challenge and illumination of art.&#8221; A founding board was selected a year ago and an Executive Director was recently hired. NTEN is now considering how best to fill its mandate. Included in the list of functions NTEN might serve: </P>
<UL>
<LI>Meetinghouse, where peers share know-how and form collaborative enterprises 
<LI>Clearinghouse of knowledge and tools for non-profit technology assistance 
<LI>Incubator of new technology assistance organizations, programs and projects 
<LI>Rainmaker, mobilizing new resources to advance non-profits&#8217; technology capacity 
<LI>Think Tank, scanning for new technology developments and analyzing potential non-profit applications </LI></UL>
<P>NTEN currently hosts a listserv for discussion on nonprofits and technology. You can subscribe by sending an email to nten-subscribe@yahoogroups.com.</P>
<H4><A href="http://www.techsoup.org">TechSoup</A> Powered by <A href="http://www.compumentor.org">CompuMentor</A></H4>
<P>TechSoup.org offers nonprofits a superlative online resource. TechSoup functions as a nonprofit community-wide portal where you can find information on everything from hardware and software discounts for nonprofits to database development, hiring consultants or creating Internet presence. Along with fact sheets, articles, checklists and many other useful resources on a wide range of topics, TechSoup also puts out a monthly e-newsletter called By The Cup which updates you on events and features at the Web site. Finally, TechSoup operates a Community Center where it provides opportunities for nonprofits to share stories and engage in dialogues. Every month a new weeklong online forum is launched and TechSoup maintains ongoing forums on many issues.</P>
<H4><A href="http://www.npower.org">NPower</A></H4>
<P>NPower, a Seattle based technology support provider, focuses on non-profits around Seattle and Puget Sound. In that region its services include technology assessment and planning, hands on technical support and training among other things. Through a new partnership with Microsoft, NPower plans to help 12 communities launch their own independent non-profit NPower programs or organizations in the next five years. NPower hopes this effort results in a well-organized network of programs that improves the delivery of non-profit technology services across the country. NPower also maintains a Web site with many useful resources and links. </P>
<H4><A href="http://www.americorps.org/vista_tech">Teaming for Technology</A></H4>
<P>Teaming for Technology is a national program, sponsored by IBM and the United Way. The program uses AmeriCorps VISTAs to improve communities by helping nonprofits reap the benefits of technology. There are 16 sites nationwide and each site offers its own mix of services that directly reflects the needs of the community. Services range from training, to helping nonprofits upgrade equipment to database and Web site design. Sites are located in Chicago, Boston, LA, NY, Austin and nine other cities. The sites operate independently but they do collaborate to share strategies on volunteer recruitment.</P>
<P>As mentioned above, there are many nonprofit technology support providers and resources worth noting. Some other organizations, programs and resources you should be aware of include:</P>

<h3 class="title">Street Tech Poem: Shadows That Covered My Future in a Lost World</h3>

<p><i>In honor of Michael J. Booth</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shadows covering my future in a lost world<br>
  Gangs, drugs, and lots of friends never seem to help<br>
  Cold and lonely nights makes you realize things about yourself<br>
  No direction, no future and no concerns about myself<br>
  No one can ever know how my soul had felt<br>
  It was just another day, another night that had to be dealt </p>
<p>The day my brother had passed away from gang violence<br>
  My life had stopped as everything became silenced<br>
  Friends that were friends seemed faked,<br>
  Wanting me to retaliate<br>
  My life flashes before my heart can make a beat<br>
  As the gun was handed down to me<br>
  A tear falls from my eye as I walked away<br>
  Just couldn&#146;t do it, knowing tomorrow was the day<br>
  Now as I stare at the casket while being lowered into the ground<br>
  I have then changed, wanting for my life to be turned around</p>
<p>Overcoming certain obstacles in my life<br>
  Needing to survive prevents me from doing right <br>
  Now it&#146;s the time for a change, something new <br>
  Moving was the only thing that I could do<br>
  Going to jobs and getting rejections made me strong and able <br>
  to see <br>
  Almost started selling dope again; at least crack heads respected me<br>
  Staying strong, keeping my head up and hoping for a chance<br>
  I found a job where I felt I could advance<br>
  Five years within the company and what do I have to show for it<br>
  No respect for what I have done for the company, so I quit<br>
  Wanting more in life but could not afford to go to school<br>
  I then heard about a program called street tech, which I thought, was cool<br>
  Understanding where I came from and what I was willing to do<br>
  They gave me a chance to start something new<br>
  My life has become much brighter as the dark shadow&#146;s caste away<br>

<h3 class="title">Planning for Local Community Internet Awareness Initiatives</h3>

<p>Clyde, Kansas, population 800, received a grant for community training to develop 
  local electronic communication skills and Internet applications awareness in 
  three specific areas: civic, personal, and business. After many internal planning 
  meetings and a conference call with <a href="http://lone-eagles.com">Lone Eagle 
  Consulting</a>, they asked me to come for multiple presentations as the first 
  in a series of two presenter&#146;s visits.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Clyde, KS, I met with 2 HS students and within 10 minutes 
  they were creating a digital storytelling presentation tour of Clyde using my 
  new CD-write digital camera (Sony Mavica CD-1000). Over a two day period, I 
  showed their multimedia creation as I presented for the library board, clients 
  at the senior center, the junior high school staff, the full high school assembly 
  of students and faculty, and then at a keynote for the Chamber Banquet. By the 
  time I was finished, I&#146;d presented for 299 persons out of the population 
  of 800.</p>
<p>The day I left these same high school students created a web authoring and 
  training business and I&#146;ve continued to keep in touch them. They have created 
  business flyers, business cards, T-shirts with their logo and have five businesses 
  on contract for web page creation. They are not allowed to pocket their earnings, 
  but will use the money to buy multimedia presentation equipment, and a CD-1000, 
  to support their business and training activities. The idea is they have created 
  jobs for themselves that will allow them to remain in Clyde to assure the future 
  of the community.</p>

<h3 class="title">The New Gold Rush - Mining Raw Human Potential Using Free Web Tools</h3>

<p>As the cost of computers and Internet access continues to drop, and the range 
of free Web tools and online self-directed learning opportunities expands, serious 
questions emerge: How can we provide the best training for the most people&#151;requiring 
the least investment of time and effort, yet proven to produce inspired, self-motivated 
learners? There is a huge, untapped economic reserve of raw human potential, made 
accessible by the Internet&#146;s ability to offer ongoing, low-cost education, 
training and support.<p>
Here are a few examples of them.
<ul>
  <li> Citizen-to-citizen mentoring is the only way there will be enough mentors 
    to meet the need, seeing as how six billion new Internet users are expected 
    over the next 15 years due to advances in low-cost, high speed, two-way Internet 
    satellite and wireless technologies. At <a href="http://www.about.com">About.com</a> 
    we see individual mentors hosting national topic-specific directories of resources 
    as part of a commercial business. Where is the local counterpart? At the <a href="http://granite.syr.edu/vrd/">ASKA+ 
    site</a> one can see topical listings of citizens&#146; expertise with offerings 
    of free online mentorship, an easily replicable model relevant to local and 
    global citizen-to-citizen teaching</li>
  <li> We&#146;re still seeing free E-business start-up services offered by dozens 
    of businesses. Growing online consumer communities using interactive tools 
    is fast becoming mainstream. There are rapidly emerging and diverse models 
    for micropayments and alternative economies. For example: <a href="http://www.fatbrain.com">Fatbrain.com</a> 
    and <a href="http://www.mightyworlds.com">Mightyworlds.com</a> reward creative 
    citizens who post learning resources and articles. <a href="http://www.epinions.com">Epinions.com</a> 
    rewards citizens who rate online resources. The number of examples is soaring.</li>
  <li> The need exists to emphasize the role of youth-based community Internet 
    awareness-raising through low-cost, short-term, local action initiatives such 
    as those posted at the <a href="http://lone-eagles.com/academy.htm">Bootstrap 
    Academy</a> and &#147;<a href="http://lone-eagles.com/teled.htm">Building 
    Learning Communities</a>.&#148;

<h3 class="title">What's New from Chittenden Community TV</h3>

<i>Since 1984, <a href="http://www.cctv.org">CCTV</a> has work to promote democracy, 
alternatives to mainstream media, and economic opportunity in Burlington, VT. 
CCTV operates Channel 17/Town Meeting TV, Northern Image Production digital production 
and duplication services, and <a href="http://www.cyberskillsvt.org">Cyberskills/Vermont</a> 
and computer awareness, access and training in Burlington's Old North End. </i> 
<hr>
<h4> Governor's Weekly Press Conference Now On Line</h4>
<p> In February, <a href="http://www.cctv.org">CCTV</a> announced the launch of 
  its newest project &#147;Streaming Democracy.&#148; In an effort to increase 
  the public's access to state government, video coverage of Vermont Governor 
  Howard Dean's weekly press conference became available on line, along with the 
  Governor's Inaugural and 2001 Budget Addresses and complete coverage of &#147;Point 
  Counterpoint,&#148; a legislative debate series. The Governor's press conferences 
  may also be seen on public access channels across Vermont. 
<h4> Cyberskills Covered </h4>
<p> When &#147;ethnic cleansing&#148; swept through Kenya in 1991, it spelled 
  the end of Duncan Nganga&#146;s prosperity. As a Kikuyu raising cows and chickens 
  in a Rift Valley collective, he was among 900 farmers forced to flee with their 
  families from a rampaging rival tribe, the Kelenjin.
<p> &quot;We used to live a good life,&#148; recalls Nganga, an evangelical Christian 
  who compares his difficulties to the biblical story of Job. &#147;They burned 
  my house. We had to move to the city. I sold my pickup truck. Sometimes my kids 
  went to sleep hungry. But I am a believer, and I know God is going to provide.&#148;
<p> If so, one of His initial provisions was to put Nganga&#151;pronounced &#147;Nyanya&quot;&#151;on 
  the path to computer literacy in Burlington, where he has friends to help him 
  get settled... 
<p> Nganga&#146;s link to a new life is CyberSkills Vermont, a technology center 
  in the Old North End. It&#146;s an educational resource for people in need of 
  workforce training and public access to computers. 
<p> &quot;When I came here last year, my first problem was communication,&#148; 
  Nganga explains in a thick accent. &#147;I know the British version of the English 
  language, so maybe I cannot figure out some words you say.&#148;</p>
<p> To help overcome that barrier, Nganga is pursuing a high-school equivalency 
  degree at Community College of Vermont. But in the United States, computer know-how 
  is essential for a career in auto mechanics, which is how the short, solidly 
  built East African supplemented his dairy and poultry earnings until social 
  upheaval sent him scrambling. 
<p> At CyberSkills, Nganga qualified for the community scholarship program available 
  to Chittenden County residents&#151;the courses would otherwise cost $165. He 
  is enrolled in courses on computer basics, the Internet and Web page design. 
  Nganga is one of 300 people who benefit each year from such classes held in 
  the upstairs lab; one floor down, the public-access center charges $1 per day 
  for computer use and $2 an hour to go online. 
<p> &quot;Duncan understands you have to practice,&#148; observes Hez Obermark, 
  an Americorps/VISTA volunteer at CyberSkills. &#147;He really puts in the time.&#148; 
<hr>
<p> &#151;The full story of Nganga and the 300 others in <a href="http://www.sevendaysvt.com/cyberskills">Seven 
  Days Newspaper</a> by Susan Green is now available online, reprinted with permission.

<h3 class="title">Community Networking on the Night Shift, Part Two: in which a Community Organizer Tries to Be a Techie</h3>

In <a href="http://www.civicnet.org/comtechreview/on_the_night_shift.htm">Part 
One</a> I detailed my failed attempts to become a policy wonk. The night shift 
simply did not leave enough time for the reading and studying that is the province 
of the policy wonks. So then I decided that I would rather be a techie than a 
community organizer. That&#146;s the job that impresses people; that&#146;s where 
the control is. I wanted to sit down at the computer and manage the site. I wanted 
to learn a skill that would bring me big money in the workplace. Furthermore, 
I wanted to quit wearing myself out on the organizing. There&#146;s always too 
much to do and too little time, and it&#146;s really hard to see progress.
<p>
We had great techies at ACORN (Akron Community Online Resource Network) and at 
CH-UH.Net (Cleveland Heights-University Heights Community Network), and I loved 
to listen to them talk. I would make up little sentences with words that sounded 
cool. &#147;Anne drove the fast, wide SCSI bus into Hubba Doo&#146;s and ran in 
for a burger and a gigapop.&#148;<p>
The problem was that I had absolutely no idea what the words meant. I struggled 
with the age of technology, and if I hadn&#146;t had to function in a modern law 
library, I wouldn&#146;t have learned anything beyond word processing. In fact, 
word processing didn&#146;t come easy, except for the typing part of it. Being 
able to eliminate mistakes without using correction tape was a miracle, but the 
printer was a typewriter with major attitude. I don&#146;t want to think about 
how many reams of paper I&#146;ve wasted because I didn&#146;t set something properly, 
put letterhead in upside down, put envelopes in backwards, couldn&#146;t figure 
out how to stop a print job, etc.<p>
By now I&#146;ve moved through a number of word processing programs, and I have 
resented every change. I dread the words, &#147;We don&#146;t support that anymore.&#148; 
Apparently the idea is for the users to support the manufacturers by buying new 
software. My first program was Spellbinder, and my husband once asked me if I 
was ever going to read the manual. &#147;Not while you&#146;re in the house,&#148; 
I said.<p>
But I did read the manual, and I gained a sense of power. One night at dinner 
I said, &#147;Today I put text in the buffer; then I got it out and put it exactly 
where I wanted it.&#148;<p>
&#147;&#146;Way to go, Mom!&#148; said my son, who was born knowing how to do 
all this stuff. It took me years to realize that the Windows Clipboard was just 
an ordinary old buffer. I don&#146;t want to admit how much time I spent trying 
to open the Clipboard.<p>
But of course Spellbinder is long gone, along with a bunch of big floppies that 
I&#146;ll never be able to read again without resurrecting old technology, which 
by the way, we have in the attic. Then there was XyWrite III at work, which really 
wasn&#146;t bad. I could do neat things like snaking columns, and the manual was 
helpful. But then, of course, came XyWrite IV, with a manual that must have been 
written by the computer itself, because it bore no human touch.<p>
Then one day I sat down for my stint at the reference desk and came face to face 
with Windows95, which my techie wannabe boss had decided would be a chuckle for 
us to learn. I had to go to an all-day training session on a Saturday. The dos 
shell that I&#146;d used to manage my files was gone, and learning that had been 
a tour de force. Now there were little folders and icons for &#147;cut&#148; and 
&#147;paste&#148;&#151;real techie language. But I learned Word, yea even up to 
Word 2000, which is a miracle for someone who approached this with the mantra 
&#147;In the beginning was Word, and Anne was sore afraid.&#148;<p>
There were still more packages to learn. For some reason PowerPoint came easily, 
after I&#146;d gone very slowly through the tutorials that our tech support person 
had put on the ref desk computer. But Access was something that I didn&#146;t 
get very far with. I&#146;m not even trying Excel.<p>
There was one big area left, and my chance at it came with early retirement. I 
would learn how to design web pages! I had the art background, and this time I 
would prevail. I worked on Composer, I worked on FrontPage, and I even worked 
on the web wizards. I never understood the architecture. I just couldn&#146;t 
develop a schematic that worked for me. I&#146;d put up a personal web page with 
a wizard, and I couldn&#146;t even figure out how to transfer an image to the 
page. I went back to cheat sheets. I already had a bunch of them for the email 
programs that my husband and son had installed as well as any other routines that 
I didn&#146;t understand. 
<p>Finally I faced the truth. At a Saturday work session I was trying to teach 
  someone how to use our community calendar, and I saw that she was way ahead 
  of me. I called the techies over and made a public pronouncement that I was 
  a technomoron and wasn&#146;t even going to try to learn more than the pitiful 
  amount I&#146;d accumulated thus far.<p>
  So much for the glory. So much for any transferable skill, like web design, 
  that might actually earn money in the workplace. I&#146;d already gotten a part-time 
  job in a law library, and it would be all that I could do to stay current with 
  the legal databases. Legal reference is my job, not technology. Funny how neither 
  reference librarians nor community organizers have high-paying jobs!<p>
  Then I remembered that years ago my son had said to me, &#147;Mom, how can you 
  run ACORN when you can&#146;t ftp a file?&#148;
<p> I&#146;d replied, &#147;We&#146;ve got techies; what we need are community 
  organizers.&#148; I should have listened to my own voice. You&#146;ve got to 
  do what you can do. Techie and community organizers are a team, and you play 
  on the side for which you have some ability. Even if you&#146;re tired. Even 
  if the reporter who left you a message never returns your calls. Even if there 
  is too much stuff in the pile on your desk. And even if you wish you&#146;d 
  been born with other abilities.

<h3 class="title">Click on Over: A Profile of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Taunton (MA) Technology Center</h3>

<p>"I like the computer room a lot because when I first started to come here 
  I did not know anything about the computers. All the time Karen, Randy and 
  I always joke around that is what I like about the computer room it is interesting 
  and fun and I know a lot more about computers now than when I first came here 
  and that was two years ago." —Club member, age 11</p>
<p>Our computer room must have looked a lot different two years ago. At that 
  time the room enjoyed celebrated community status as a bingo hall at the <a
href="http://www.taunton.org/">Boys & Girls Club of Taunton</a>. Located 
  thirty miles south of Boston and twenty miles east of Providence, Taunton has 
  a population of roughly 55,000. A large number of senior citizens, Latinos 
  and Portuguese are at home here in our diverse community. The mission of our 
  Boys & Girls Club is to inspire and enable all young people, especially 
  those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, 
  responsible and caring citizens. In 1999-2000, we served nearly 1,300 children 
  aged 6-18. Approximately 65% of our daily participants come from low and moderate-income 
  households and are eligible for federally subsidized programs. Accordingly, 
  our yearly Club membership fee is $10.</p>
<p>With generous funding and software donations from both <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> and <a
href="http://www.shaq.com/">Shaquille O'Neal</a> our Club was chosen as a pilot 
  site for the <a href="http://www.bgca.org/">Boys & Girls Club</a> Operation 
  Connect technology program. <a href="http://www.powerup.org/">PowerUP</a>, 
  new computers, and <a href="http://www.americorps.org/">AmeriCorps *VISTA</a> 
  helped make our computer center fully operational in September 2000. An estimated 
  200 youth and community members utilize our walk-in computer center each week. 
  Our lab has over 70 computers divided into three sections for ages 6-9, 10-12, 
  and 13-18 to make supervision easier and encourage peer communication.</p>
<p>Our center structures activities that complement, not duplicate, school activities. 
  <a
href="http://www.powerup.org/powerup_online.shtml">PowerUP Online</a> has been 
  helpful in allowing easy access to such activities. Computer center staff, 
  technology mentors, and community volunteers provide general homework help and 
  technical assistance. Past projects include participation in the <a
href="http://www.freevibe.com/">Anti-Drug campaign</a> and celebration and consciousness-raising 
  of Hispanic Heritage Month, Black History Month, Women's History Month, Election 
  Day, and Earth Day. For Martin Luther King, Jr. Day computer center staff took 
  four children to a breakfast celebration at a local college. Children are taught 
  to use a variety of software programs for word processing, homepage building, 
  digital photography, graphic design, playing games, creating greeting cards, 
  research projects, email, and GIF animation. We have a game of the week contest 
  that doubles as entertainment and a general vehicle to get children interested 
  in computers. Our bulletin board showcased a gallery of stories and homework 
  assignments contributed by our members. In May our activities are focused on 
  digital arts and culture. In addition, our computer center is creating and 
  piloting an <a href="http://www.geocities.com/powerupepals">ePal program</a> 
  between other PowerUP labs across the country. Our goal for the ePal program 
  is to engage children in learning about other areas of the country, practicing 
  technology skills by undertaking structured and safe ePal correspondence with 
  children in other computer centers. We are very busy!</p>
<p>I was recently asked about leadership in our computer center and I would like 
  to share what I have gleaned from my service as an AmeriCorps *VISTA and PowerUp 
  Technology Project Coordinator. Know your community and let that knowledge 
  guide your activities. I landed in Taunton, and in Massachusetts in general 
  for that matter, one week before my VISTA service began. I placed a high priority 
  on learning about Taunton and its citizens. I attended local community meetings 
  and networked with others working on community technology issues. I read our 
  local <a href="http://www.uwgat.org/">United Way</a> needs assessment online. 
  Talk to people; technology will not replace a human connection. Get vocal. 
  Enthusiasm is contagious—pass it on. Set rules for the children and stick to 
  them, using a guiding phrase such as "You can do whatever you want in here 
  except break the rules." Think about what will appeal to your members. 
  What web sites are they exploring? What are their interests? What do they 
  want to learn about? Why do they come to your center, what are they hoping 
  to gain? How can you better provide it? Ask them. Your members will be your 
  best guide to running your computer center successfully. That is basically 
  what we did!</p>
<p>Most importantly, children are like sponges, absorbing information and knowledge 
  so quickly it boggles the mind. I have seen children learn and master the complex 
  Microsoft Front Page and Microsoft Publisher in one sitting. Children have 
  a natural inclination to learn, and technology offers a unique conduit to make 
  learning fun and exciting. From time to time our members benefit greatly from 
  enjoying the luxury of recreation in our lab. The technology and activities 
  stimulate initial interest in the computer lab; having caring, knowledgeable 
  adults, volunteers, and mentors in the lab will keep folks coming back for more. 
  All the technology in the world cannot replace the joy children feel when we 
  take an active interest in their lives. It is our responsibility to provide 
  and maintain that positive human experience as best we can, working like hell 
  to get things done, with technology as our backdrop.</p>

<h3 class="title">Seattle's Sleepy CTCs</h3>

<p>As late as December of 1999, residents wishing to get much needed access to computers 
or the internet, could visit any of the 35 community or neighborhood technology 
centers (CTC&#146;s) throughout the Seattle area. With few exceptions, they would 
likely find the lights out, the doors locked, and the computers sitting idle. 
Or, if they were able to gain entry, they would likely find only one or two, if 
any, of the available computers and/or printers functioning.<p>
Here we had thousands of dollars worth of space and technology that had been generously 
donated to worthy causes, but which was not being utilized, making obvious the 
critical point that bridging the digital divide takes more than just throwing 
equipment and software at the problem.<p>
A number of conscientious and motivated people began to look into the situation 
to determine what issues needed to be resolved in order to get these labs up and 
running to full capacity as initially intended.<p>
Several key needs were identified, including: 1) timely and capable tech support; 
2) trained staff for managing the labs; 3) contemporary and consistent systems, 
networking, and internet connectivity; 4) technology training for lab patrons 
as well as paid staff and volunteers; and 5) effectual marketing, advertising, 
and outreach. <p>
There were also the issues of a lack of community networking and involvement, 
and the false perception of technology as an end, rather than as a tool. CTC's 
needed to be viewed more than just a source for technological access, but also 
as a means for individual and community welfare and development.<p>
It was also determined that, because the problem of nonfunctional or dysfunctional 
CTC&#146;s in Seattle was so widespread, it would be wise to target several representative 
and strategically significant labs (primarily in low-income, minority, and disabled 
communities where the need was the greatest). The object was to make sure these 
labs were brought up to full utilization and sustainability prior to applying 
them as a model to other existing labs as well as future CTC&#146;s.<p>
Consequently, the City of Seattle Technology Department, headed by David Keyes, 
in conjunction with the Seattle Public Library, represented by Daria Cal, various 
public and corporate technology organizations (most notably SCN, headed by Steve 
and Melissa Guest), students and faculty at several universities and colleges, 
and select community centers, formed an alliance (see SCTA) and partnerships (see: 
SCN Partners), designed and implemented a scalable and comprehensive program, 
and obtained funding from the Federal Department of Education.<p>
This program included the hiring of full and part-time administrators and staff 
(initially 1 project coordinator, 4 lab coordinators, and 1 technician), technology 
matching funds for select projects, and the donation of state-of-the-art computers, 
software, and internet connectivity&#151;which, for the most part, took care of 
needs 1 &#150; 3 (listed above) for these targeted CTC&#146;s.
<p>Provision was also made to secure several VISTA&#146;s (Volunteer In Service 
  To America) to assist with satisfying needs 2, 4, and 5, as well as implementation 
  and sustainability of the program. They included:<p>
  A.&nbsp;Angel Lamar, who worked with the City of Seattle Technology Department. 
  She was responsible for recruiting volunteers intended to assist the part-time 
  lab coordinators for the targeted labs, the roll-out of a needs-awareness and 
  community out-reach project, and liaison between various partners in the project. 
  <p>
  B.&nbsp;Delia Burke, Katie Yeo, Tricia Satre, and Jay Sadler, who have, or are 
  now working with Digital Promise (formerly Neighborhood Network Consortium). 
  They have been responsible for consulting with low-income housing projects on 
  how to start and maintain respective computer labs, as well as providing recycled 
  computer equipment, software, classes, and limited tech support, for existing

<p>
  James Werle, a graduate student at the University of Washington, and Louis Fox 
  of the University of Washington Office of Educational Partnership, were recently 
  instrumental in negotiating service-learning contracts with the targeted CTC's. 
  This provided 20 college students with part-time jobs in which to apply the 
  skills they have been learning, while at the same time permitting them to gain 
  work experience for future employment. This was also a cost-effective way to 
  help staff the labs with knowledgeable personnel&#151;beyond the lab coordinators 
  hired by the SCTA.<p>
  The good news is that, as of this writing, there are now seven sustainable, 
  fully functional, staffed, and supported CTC's with high-speed internet connections, 
  and several other CTC's advancing rapidly in the program's pipeline. Most of 
  these labs are fast closing in on full utilization, and they are gradually putting 
  into place a comprehensive educational package complete with basic technology 
  learning paths, career services, and literacy programs. Thousands of minority, 
  low-income, disabled, and the elderly now have access to computers and the internet 
  that they otherwise would not have. 
<p> In part, this program has helped to recently make Seattle one of the worlds 
  most wired cities--if not the most wired city. Approximately 88% of Seattle 
  residents have access to computers at various locations (compared with 51% nationwide), 
  and 72% have internet access (compared with 41% nationwide). (See: <a href="http://www.scn.org/teched/facts4.htm">Seattle 
  Digital Divide Statistics</a>)
<p>
  So, where do we go from here? Even with the rosy statistical picture for Seattle, 
  there are still approximately 150,000 residents who do not have access to technology. 
  And while the quantitative disparity between those with access and those without 
  has drastically declined, the qualitative disparity has increased. 
<p> To bridge this last divide, plans are already in the works to increase the 
  number of targeted CTC's as well as expand the technology education program 
  to the branch libraries. Additional partnerships are being developed with local, 
  state, and national organization for the purpose of resource sharing, collaboration, 
  marketing, community building and empowerment, etc. Hopefully, all of Seattle 
  will soon be technologically awake and thriving.

<h3 class="title">Opening the Doors to Digital Opportunity: A Retrospective, 1991-2001</h3>

<P>With a new administration in Washington and changes underway, it is important 
to reflect on the past decade&#146;s achievements &#151;a reminder of how far 
we&#146;ve come and to stiffen our resolve for the changes ahead. 
<ul>
  <li> <b>Accomplishment Number One:</b> We&#146;ve bridged the digital divide 
    in our schools&#151;almost. In the early nineties, data showed that students 
    in wealthier districts were gaining access to educational technology tools 
    faster than poor students. President Clinton and Vice President Gore issued 
    a Technology Literacy Challenge, and backed the rhetoric up with a budgetary 
    blitzkrieg.</li>
</ul>
<p>
U.S. Department of Education ed tech funding rose to $872 million in 2001, a 3700 
percent increase from the $23 million appropriated in 1993. With the addition 
of billions of dollars in E-rate funding and an army of mobilized NetDay volunteers, 
the percentage of schools connected to the Internet increased rapidly, from 35 
percent in 1994 to 98 percent in 2000. However, gaps still persist. For example, 
82 percent of instructional rooms have Internet access in schools with the lowest 
concentration of poor students, compared to 60 percent of the rooms in schools 
with the highest concentrations of students in poverty. 
<ul>
  <li> <b>Accomplishment Number Two</b>: We&#146;ve heightened the world&#146;s 
    awareness about individual, community, and national digital divides and efforts 
    to bridge them. </li>
</ul>
<p> From the seminal Benton Foundation study, <a href="http://www.benton.org/Library/Low-Income/intro.html">Losing 
  Ground Bit by Bit: Low Income Communities in the Digital Age</a> and Department 
  of Commerce data and studies to the PBS digital divide series, we&#146;ve become 
  more aware of the nature of the technological gaps that exist and persist in 
  our society.
<p>
We know that home Internet access is growing rapidly but saturated only in upper-income 
households. We know the fault lines include educational attainment, occupation, 
race, gender, age, and geography. We&#146;ve learned that, in contrast to those 
who see the digital divide as a benign and ephemeral delay in the diffusion of 
technology, the impact of these lag times is highly detrimental for disadvantaged 
communities. 
<ul>
  <li> <b>Accomplishment Number Three:</b> With the hard work of organizers at 
    the local level, and funding from the corporate and federal level, we&#146;ve 
    created a vast array of Community Technology Access Points (CAPs).</li>
</ul>
<p>
From its humble beginnings at the Playing to Win community technology center in 
Harlem, the National Science Foundation funded a catalyst for the creation and 
expansion of CAPs in the form CTCNet. Funding from Commerce&#146;s Technology 
Opportunity Program helped a number of CAPs become showcase sites and models that 
others could emulate. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development launched 
a major effort to put Neighborhood Network centers in section 8 housing. The Gates 
Foundation and E-rate provided an enormous infusion of capital to help libraries 
become portals to digital opportunity. Further assistance came in the form of 
the new U.S. Department of Education&#146;s Community Technology Centers program 
and the 21st Century Learning Centers Program, providing resources for after-school 
CAP programming. Corporate programs have recently popped up, like PowerUP and 
Intel&#146;s Computer Clubhouse.<p>
The Benton Foundation&#146;s Digital Divide Network has become an important communications 
channel for activity in this arena and, with the recent launch of the Connectado 
campaign, a source for information on why, how, and where Americans can get connected.
<ul>
  <li> <b>Conclusion</b>: While great strides have been made in the last decade 
    the road ahead is full of challenges. Between the new Republican administration 
    in Washington, and the slumping economy, many who run community technology 
    programs are worried that their government and corporate funding will dry 
    up. </li>
</ul>
<p> With computer prices low and Internet access cheap or free, some question 
  the need for community technology centers. Now is an important time to look 
  hard at mission statements, business plans, and one&#146;s sustainability model. 
  Even when we reach our national goal of every household connected, community 
  technology centers will still have a vital role to play.

<h3 class="title">The Debate Over HR 1542 - The Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act: Will the Bells Steal America's Digital Future?</h3>

<p><i>There's been much discussion about HR 1542, the Tauzin-Dingell bill. Whatever 
  its fate, the following piece by Audrie Krause and the response by Al Hammond 
  and APT reflect basic differences about telco policy well into the future. For 
  more on the bill see the <a href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/legis/legis.htm#hr1542">CyberTelecom 
  News</a>, the <a href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/legis/legis.htm">Washington 
  Internet Project's legislation page</a>, the two opposing articles in <a href="http://www.isp-planet.com/perspectives/separation.html">ISP 
  Planet</a>, and the Association for Community Networking <a href="http://www.afcn.net/docs/listserv_1542.html">exchanges</a>.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>In June 2000, NetAction released a <a href="http://www.netaction.org/broadband/bells">comprehensive 
  report</a> describing how the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) broke 
  the promises they made to regulators in the 1990s to deploy high-speed fiber 
  optic networks. If the Bells had kept those promises, almost half of the nation's 
  households and the vast majority of our schools would already be capable of 
  delivering high-speed Internet access. Instead, only about 500,000 households 
  have access to the Internet over fiber. NetAction sees this as a contributing 
  factor to the digital divide because those fiber optic networks would have been 
  widely deployed by now in low-income urban neighborhoods and rural communities, 
  as well as in schools, libraries and health care facilities. 
<p>
The Bells' promised to deploy fiber optic networks in exchange for relief 
from important pro-consumer regulations. In states where regulators went along 
with this tradeoff, traditional rate-of-return regulation intended to protect 
consumers from profit gouging was replaced with incentive or price cap regulation. 
The change gave the Bells more profits, but few of these high-speed networks were 
ever completed. 
<p> This history of failed promises should be a warning to Congress to reject 
  H.R. 1542, a bill which would allow Bell entry into long distance data markets 
  without regard to the state of competition in local phone service. Co-authored 
  by Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA) and John Dingell (D-MI), it was narrowly approved 
  by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 9. (For the bill's current 
  status, see <a href="http://www.netaction.org/briefings">NetAction's Broadband 
  Briefings</a> newsletter). 
<p>
Its supporters claim H.R. 1542 will help bridge the "digital divide" 
by expanding broadband deployment. But what it really does is remove a key consumer 
protection that Congress included in the 1996 Act: the requirement that local 
markets be open to competition before the Bells are allowed into long distance 
markets in their territories. <p>
H.R. 1542 also poses a threat to competitive DSL providers, which means it will 
have an impact on efforts to bridge the "digital divide" and expand 
access to broadband technology. Demand for all types of high-speed access is expected 
to skyrocket over the next few years. But full deployment of cable broadband won't 
be possible for several more years because of the need for network upgrades, and 
high-speed wireless and satellite service will also take some time to develop. 
That makes DSL an increasingly popular choice for consumers who want high-speed 
Internet access. But DSL won't remain affordable if the Bells monopolize 
the market, and that's a real possibility if H.R. 1542 becomes law.<p>
Competition is crucial to keeping broadband Internet access affordable and accessible, 
but competitive DSL providers are in a tough position. These mostly small companies 
compete head-to-head with the Bells in offering high-speed service to consumers. 
But the Bells own the networks these companies must buy the service from in order 
to sell it to consumers. Since the Bells are selling to their competitors, they 
have absolutely no incentive to sell wholesale DSL service at an affordable price. 
The incentive that Congress included in The Telecommunications Act of 1996 linking 
entry into long distance markets to the requirement that local markets be competitive 
would vanish if H.R. 1542 were enacted.
<p> If the Bells had kept their promises in the 1990s, the nation might have been 
  fully wired with fiber optic networks by now. If the Bells had met the conditions 
  spelled out in the 14-point checklist, the nation might already have vigorous 
  competition in both DSL and local phone service. But the Bells chose instead 
  to stonewall competition by engaging in protracted legal and regulatory maneuvers, 
  and by lobbying Congress to change the law. If the Tauzin-Dingell bill is enacted, 
  DSL will go the way of fiber optics. And the Bells will once again have stolen 
  America's digital future.

<h3 class="title">The Debate Over HR 1542 - The Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act: Response from the Alliance for Public Technology</h3>

<p><i>There's been much discussion about HR 1542, the Tauzin-Dingell bill. Whatever 
  its fate, the following piece by Audrie Krause and the response by Al Hammond 
  and APT reflect basic differences about telco policy well into the future. For

  Planet</a>, and the Association for Community Networking <a href="http://www.afcn.net/docs/listserv_1542.html">exchanges</a>.</i> 
</p>
<hr>
<p>NetAction has suggested that the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment 
  Act of 2001 (H.R. 1542) threatens broadband Internet access because it (a) removes 
  the incentive for incumbent local phone companies (ILECs) to open their markets 
  to competition before entry into long distance; and (b) will put ILECs in a 
  position to monopolize broadband and dial-up services. Further NetAction argues 
  that the bill will not ensure broadband service availability to rural areas 
  while simultaneously expanding the digital divide. Finally, NetAction argues 
  that the ILECs are not deserving beneficiaries of the bill's largesse because 
  the ILECs didn't keep their prior promises to deploy fiber optic services in 
  exchange for removal of rate of return regulation. </p>
<p>
The Alliance for Public Technology (APT) applauds NetAction's decision to raise 
the public consciousness on these issues. However, APT would like to emphasize 
a somewhat different and ultimately, we believe, more fundamental point about 
the debate over H.R. 1542. The issue is not H.R. 1542 or any other legislative 
vehicle for accelerating ILEC entry into long distance, but: 
<ul>
  <li> Timely development and equitable deployment of technology neutral, accessible 
    broadband communications infrastructure and services to all Americans at affordable 
    rates; and</li>
  <li>Equitable implementation and enforcement of regulations governing like competitors 
    competing in the same market.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Too much of the current debate mirrors arguments put forth by corporations seeking 
to protect or expand market share in the converging marketplace for telecommunications 
and data services. While APT is not unsympathetic to the understandable concerns 
of the companies and their stockholders, APT believes that the public's interest 
in available, accessible, affordable broadband communications must remain the 
paramount concern. This means that those competing in the market must invest in 
the deployment of infrastructure and the provision of service to all communities 
regardless of socioeconomic status, race, class or geography. Only in this way 
can we assure that no American is left behind. But to do so, we must assure that 
all who invest and compete, fairly contribute to the efforts to deploy and provide.<p>
APT is convinced that an unwavering and uncritical insistence on unbundled access 
to newly minted broadband data infrastructure and services is as problematic for 
telephone as it is for cable and wireless competitors. It provides a significant 
disincentive for investment because the return on investment is severely undermined. 
This in turn facilitates a tendency to &#147;game&#148; the regulatory system 
at the expense of the public interest because the firms' interests and the public's 
interests are at odds. If the regulatory environment is fair to all competitors, 
and all contribute in an equitable manner that assures fair rather than favored 
competition, then the public and the companies' interests become one and the same. 
In the final analysis, it does not matter whether it is a national or local cable, 
telephone or wireless firm seeking to keep its networks closed by refusing to 
be interoperable, interconnected and open to all. To the extent that there are 
unserved areas, dead end or &#147;protected&#148; networks, competition cannot 
flourish and Americans as citizens, learners, patients, businesses and consumers 
will suffer. To the extent the regulatory system ostensibly operated in the name 
of the people, facilitates this result, it is unfair and ill advised.
<p> On the other hand, any effort to remove regulation must be more than just 
  &#147;even handed.&#148; It must also assure the timely development and equitable 
  deployment of technology neutral, accessible broadband communications infrastructure 
  and services to all Americans at affordable rates. This means the development 
  of reasonable guidelines and timetables for deployment to avoid electronic redlining; 
  an ongoing equitable means of financing timely equitable deployment of infrastructure; 
  provision of services at affordable prices; and a fundamental acknowledgment 
  that our evolving broadband infrastructure is a national resource that must 
  be available to all.

<h3 class="title">Digital Empowerment Programs for the Underserved</h3>

<p>The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR) is the nation's oldest, largest, 
  and most diverse civil and human rights coalition, with over 180 national organizations 
  committed to the protection and advancement of basic civil and human rights 
  for all person in our society. The Leadership Conference Education Fund (LCEF) 
  is the public education arm of the coalition and works to promote awareness 
  of contemporary social, economic, and civil rights issues. The following is 
  a synopsis of communications and Internet policy appropriations items that the 
  Leadership Conference will focus on in the 107<sup>th</sup> Congress. The Technology 
  Opportunities Program (TOP), Community Technology Centers (CTC), and the Home 
  Internet Access Program (HIAP) are three vital digital empowerment appropriations 
  items that accelerate access to and utilization of advanced technologies in 
  underserved communities. </p>
<h4 class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Technology Opportunities Program (TOP)</h4>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) formerly 
  known as the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program 
  (TIIAP) is a competitive, merit-based grant program that brings the benefits 
  of innovative digital network technologies to communities throughout the United 
  States. TOP awards totaling $13.9 million for FY 2000 went to 35 organizations 
  in 27 states and the District of Columbia. Grants for FY2000 include a number 
  of projects developed by smaller organizations, including tribal organizations, 
  a Hispanic-serving institution, and other community-based organizations. TOP 
  is administered by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications 
  and Information Administration (NTIA).</p>
<p style='
'><b>The 106<sup>th</sup> Congress and TOP &#151; </b>Last year the Clinton administration 
  requested $45.5 million for TOP and Congress appropriated $45.5 million for 
  grants through the Commerce Department's Technology Opportunities Program. 
</p>
<p style='
'><b>The 107<sup>th</sup> Congress and TOP &#151; </b>President Bush's budget proposes 
  to decrease funding for TOP by 65% from the current year's $45.5 million to 
  $15 million. Slashing funding for TOP will decimate a program that has funded 
  innovative uses of advanced telecommunications technologies for those in underserved 
  communities.</p>
<h4 style='
'>Community Technology Centers (CTCs)</h4>
<p style='
'>Community Technology Centers (CTCs) were designed to promote the development 
  of programs that demonstrate the educational effectiveness of information technology 
  in urban, rural, and economically distressed communities. CTCs have become 
  a major focus for legislators seeking to bridge the digital divide. In FY 2000, 
  $20 million was appropriated for CTCs as part of the Department of Education 
  appropriations, and for FY 2001 the Department received $65 million. In addition, 
  President Clinton requested $1 billion for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Community 
  Learning Centers, (many of which incorporated technology into their after-school 
  programs) and received <a href="http://www.ed.gov/21stcclc/">$846 million for 
  FY2001</a></p>
<p style='
'><b>The 106<sup>th</sup> Congress and CTCs &#151; </b>Last year the Clinton administration 
  requested $100 million for 1000 CTCs and Congress appropriated $65 million for 
  650 CTCs in FY 2001.</p>
<p style='
'><b>The 107<sup>th</sup> Congress and CTCs &#151; </b>In March, in a hearing before 
  the House Education and Workforce Committee, Education Secretary Roderick Paige 
  indicated that 21st Century Community Learning Centers would be consolidated 
  with the Safe and Drug Free Schools Initiative, however, program funding would 
  not be consolidated. The Bush Administration has proposed that the CTC program 
  be administered at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>
<h4 style='
'>The Home Internet Access Program (HIAP)</h4>
<p class=MsoBodyText2>The Home Internet Access Program (HIAP) was envisioned to 
  increase the number of low-income families that have access to the Internet 
  in their homes. HIAP was modeled after the highly successful Technology Opportunity 
  Program with two guiding principles: locally driven solutions and public-private 
  partnerships. HIAP would be administered by the National Telecommunications 
  and Information Administration (NTIA) who would make grants to intermediate 
  organizations -- non-profits; state, local, and tribal governments, colleges 
  and universities -- to develop local programs for providing home-based access 
  to families most at risk of being excluded from today's information-based economy.</p>
<p style='
'><b>The 106<sup>th</sup> Congress and HIAP &#151; </b>The Clinton administration proposed 
  $50 million for HIAP for expanding access to computers for low-income families 
  and for skills development but received no funds for FY 2001. </p>
<p style='
'><b>The 107<sup>th</sup> Congress and HIAP &#151; </b>The 107<sup>th</sup> Congress 
  has taken no action regarding HIAP. </p>

<h3 class="title">Community Technology Resources from VISTA Projects</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.etr.org/nsrc/pdfs/montanatech.pdf">AmeriCorps Member 
  Handbook</a>, developed for the Montana Technology Corps AmeriCorps program, 
  is an evolving resource intended to provide Members with immediate access to 
  the information most pertinent to their term of service. More importantly, according 
  to its developer, Project Director <a href="mailto:laurah@selway.umt.edu">Laura 
  Hassler</a>, it acts as a "survival guide," helping Members get through 
  their first few weeks of AmeriCorps service when the "who, what, where, 
  when, why and how" questions are most numerous. The Handbook is divided 
  into four sections: General Program Overview (program specific); Resources; 
  Reporting Requirements; and AmeriCorps Provisions and Guidelines. The materials 
  are placed in a three-ring binder so that Members can personalize it by adding 
  training materials, journal entries, pictures, and so on that they accumulate 
  throughout the year. The handbook was adapted from The Montana Campus Compact 
  AmeriCorps programs.</p>
<p>The Handbook is a valuable resource to those serving at  
  technology-focused sites around the country, offering up a free sample  
  of how to organize a successful technology program and a meaningful year  
  of service.</p>

<h3 class="title">Gathering Together: CTCNet's 10th Annual Conference</h3>

<p>This year's CTCNet Annual Conference, Advancing 
Community Technology ~ The Next Wave, June 15-17, in collaboration with the 
America Connects Consortium and the Association for Community Networking, marks 
its ten-year anniversary, a milestone warranting a brief look back at its evolution 
from the one-day, twenty-one person "All-Affiliates Meeting" hosted 
at the Harlem Playing to Win community computing center in 1991 to the three-day 
five hundred person Annual Conference hosted at the Town & Country Resort 
in San Diego this year. 
<p>These gatherings began eleven years ago, when no CTC Start-Up Manual existed. 
  Neither HUD Neighborhood Networks nor the resources that help sustain them existed; 
  there was no America Connects Consortium, no Digital Divide Network, and Falling 
  Through the Net had not yet been published. Funders had never heard of the digital 
  divide-in fact, the phrase "digital divide" had not yet been coined, 
  let alone around long enough to warrant debate about whether or not it was cliché.</p>
<p>In 1990 a new field was creating itself, but its practitioners were spread 
  around the country and working in relative isolation. The idea was forming that 
  these centers should link their efforts and share their resources. Small pockets 
  of peer-to-peer contact had already appeared, but a larger gathering had not 
  yet emerged. In 1990, the Playing To Win Network (PTWNet, the precursor to CTCNet) 
  held its first Advisory Board meeting, followed the next year by its first "all-affiliates" 
  meeting.</p>
<p>When CTC practitioners came together eleven years ago, they found that they 
  faced similar challenges to those faced today. They discovered that they could 
  replicate each other's success, that they could learn from each other's failures, 
  and that they were not alone, that others were engaged in similar efforts, driven 
  by the same desire to create equal technology access where it did not already 
  exist. The same atmosphere prevailed the following year at the second all-affiliates' 
  meeting. And again at the third -- and at each subsequent meeting, attendance 
  grew and venues changed from individual centers to museums, universities, and 
  hotels with conference facilities.</p>
<p>Attendance has expanded to include researchers and writers and representatives 
  of dozens of national organizations that didn't exist eleven years ago, all 
  dedicated to working on different components of the digital divide. We have 
  receptions and keynotes and "session coordinators" for multiple tracks 
  and concurrent sessions.</p>
<p>Early in the history of PTWNet, an affiliate member had this to say on an evaluation: 
  "PTWNet counteracts that feeling that you're battling on your own. It gives 
  purpose to the work you're doing. You're working toward a larger goal." 
  During a recent conversation, a woman from Utah described attending a consortium 
  meeting in another state, expressed an interest in creating a similar group 
  in her own state, and mentioned her eagerness to attended this year's annual 
  conference. These gatherings affirmed for her that no matter where she went, 
  people working on community technology issues face the same challenges. "They 
  remind me that I'm not doing this work alone."</p>
<p>The conference may look a bit different now than it did at the first All-Affiliates' 
  meeting, but the most important pieces remain the same. Its purpose and strength 
  remain simple: to have at least one occasion each year when everyone comes together 
  to recognize that we are not in this alone. <hr>
Lauren Kadi coordinated the 2001 CTCNet 
  National Conference.

<h3 class="title">Online Panels with the America Connects Consortium</h3>

<p>The America Connects Consortium online panels email list discussions, hosted 
by CTCNet and Education Development Center, give subscribers the opportunity to 
explore a series of topics in some depth, one at a time, in a format analogous 
to a panel session at a conference. Each month this year there is a three-week 
discussion, during which panelists make initial presentations and then field questions 
and comments from subscribers, via a moderator. Topics covered have included: 
<ul>
  <li>Arts and Media</li>
  <li>Workforce Development</li>
  <li>Disability Access and Universal Usability</li>
  <li>Program Design</li>
  <li>Partnerships</li>
  <li>Adult Education</li>
</ul>
<p>The panelists are, for the most part, managers of community technology programs, 
  but others with expertise are also invited. For example, representatives of 
  Boston Cyberarts and the New York Foundation for the Arts participated in the 
  Arts and Media panel, and there were panel contributions from ICF Consulting 
  in the Workforce Development panel. Individuals affiliated with a community 
  technology center anywhere are welcome to join the discussion. To subscribe 
  or unsubscribe, send e-mail with the name and location of your program and your 
  own name and e-mail address to <a href="mailto:info@ctcnet.org">info@ctcnet.org</a>. 
  <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org/americaconnects/panels/index.htm">Archived messages</a> 
  for the list are available.

<TD><FONT size=1><I>NO MORE STUFF! Andrew Cohill giving his keynote address: "<A href="http://www.bev.net/project/digital_library/cn_kd.pdf">Networks and the Knowledge Democracy: Nine Challenges for Communities</A>," at the Bridge Builder's Conference, Deleware State University in Dover, September 14, 2000. The 20 ounce Coke bottle prop provided an example of the over-abundance of product that characterizes much of American life, including many people's approach to community networking development. "We have this national obsession with stuff. We need more stuff. We worry that we don't have enough stuff. But not long after we buy our stuff, we often throw it out. And then complain that we don't have enough landfills ... We need to stop worrying about teaching ourselves and our children how to use the stuff we already have ... Communities that are serious about solving the digital divide will focus less on acquiring stuff and focus more on comprehensive training and support."</I></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The <A href="http://www.afcn.net/">AFCN</A> formally incorporated in 1998 after several years of informal operation. In its fourth year as the national organization for community networking, AFCN is maturing, with more organizational support, an increased emphasis on services to members, and a growing membership.<BR><BR>AFCN's mission is to improve the visibility, viability and vitality of community networking by assisting and connecting people and organizations, building public awareness, identifying best practices, encouraging research, influencing policy, and developing products and services. The AFCN helps provide a framework to understand and remedy some of the problems facing community networks at the beginning of this century. Like the Internet, AFCN is a network, and is also a network of communities.Some of the key issues for community networks in the coming years include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Developing a replicable and sustainable business model that relies less on dial up access fees and more on technology services. 
<LI>Continued pressure from private sector firms that criticize CNs as &#8220;competition&#8221; without any real legal or moral justification for such charges. 
<LI>Increased competition from private sector firms offering &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; Web sites to communities, typically supported by ad revenues. These business ventures lure local leaders with promises of &#8220;no cost&#8221; community networks that typically offer few if any of the traditional support, training, and hosting services of a &#8220;real&#8221; CN. 
<LI>Development of a common set of principles and services that define a prototypical community network, recognizing that no CN will probably ever offer all of the services enumerated. CNs need to move beyond the pioneer stage of reinventing the wheel in each community and consolidate around a commonly accepted set of best practices in services and business management. 
<LI>Wider national recognition of AFCN as an advocate for community wide networking and one of the few public service organizations with a focus on local management and control of network access and content. 
<LI>Engagement of communities and community leaders in a broad discussion about the necessity of community-managed telecommunications infrastructure and information services. </LI></UL>

<P>A troubling consolidation in the telecommunications industry that has the U.S. slowly returning to de facto monopoly control of local access by a few large companies.<BR><BR>The year 2000 was a watershed for both CTCs and CNs, as the &#8220;digital divide&#8221; issue publicized by the U.S. Department of Commerce brought technology issues to the forefront of many organizations. CTCNet and AFCN members found themselves competing for grant money with older, well-established organizations that have strong operations in Washington, but little or no track record in the community use and support of technology.<BR><BR>On the plus side, many more towns and neighborhoods began to ask the right questions about how technology can help improve their communities. The AFCN has benefited through a steady increase in members over the past nine months.<BR><BR>The <A href="http://www.afcn.net/">AFCN</A> began an ambitious program in 2000 to upgrade management procedures and central office operations, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A completely revamped billing system, including professional management and a change to calendar year billing to reduce costs and improve cash flow for the organization. 
<LI>Retention of a professional accountant to do quarterly reviews of AFCN financial records, and to assist with tax management and corporate filing with state and federal agencies. 
<LI>Establishment of a permanent mailing address and phone number for the organization, instead of changing them each time the president changed. 
<LI>Eliminated the &#8220;members only&#8221; area of the Web site because of lack of use (We found most members thought that trying to remember the user ID and password was an obstacle to regular use.)<BR>
<LI>A major facelift and re-organization of the AFCN Web site, with features like a Members page and an online directory of members and CN projects worldwide.<BR></LI></UL>
<P>Early in the year, the AFCN Board also agreed to embark on a major new member benefit&#8212;the development and distribution (only to members) of an AFCN Community Networking Handbook. This Handbook will be in an attractive, sturdy, three-ring binder to make it easy to update and add new material. Materials for the Handbook will be written by AFCN members, who will be paid. The first version will be distributed to members in late summer 2001 and will contain three major sections:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Substantive, in-depth articles of 10 to 20 pages on key topics such as funding, organizational issues, technical management, business management, and volunteer management. Each year, several new articles will be added, and current articles will be updated as needed. 
<LI>Case studies of active community networks (6-10 pages each). With a wide diversity of community network activities and models, case studies illuminate best practice ideas and make them accessible to other members and CNs. 
<LI>
<DIV align=left>Tips and techniques (2-5 pages each) will be short, concise descriptions of specific programs and activities, written to help other members develop new ideas and programs without reinventing the wheel.<BR></DIV></LI></UL>
<DIV align=left>The AFCN has also begun to develop a set of AFCN teaching materials that can be used and re-used at regional and national conferences. The first set of AFCN seminars was offered to packed audiences at the recent (December 2000) Texas community network conference in Austin. As time goes by, the Board hopes to have AFCN members offering these seminars at several different conferences in several different locations each year, so that all AFCN members will have an opportunity to gain access to the expertise and experience of other members.

Phil is Instructional Technology Coordinator for the <A href="http://www.arlington.k12.va.us">Arlington, VA Public Schools</A>; his work can be found on his <A href="http://storymakers.net">multimedia exploration</A> site, his official school site, and his <A href="http://www.his.com/pshapiro">personal presentation</A> page. Asked to elaborate or summarize all of this, Phil chose to point away from himself, to others in general and, in particular, to <A href="#ken">Ken Wyrick</A>.<BR>
<br>
<hr><p>
I first met <a name="ken">Kenneth Wyrick</a> at a computer recycling conference in Washington DC five years ago. He had flown in from Los Angeles before the conference was to begin and was helping set up tables. Had he not mentioned that he was from out of town, I might have thought that he was one of the conference organizers. Not because he was telling other people what to do, but because he was taking care of so much himself.</p>

<p>When I shook his hand, he made me feel that not only had a new friendship formed -- but a new cross-continent connection had been made.</p>

<p>Three years later at the CTCNet conference in Chicago I ran into Kenneth again, before the conference, helping set things up. The rented computers in the public area of the conference did not have a web browser on them. "We can download Netscape using the ftp program built into DOS," he explained. "Here, let me show you how." I watched in amazement as he performed this minor miracle, in the process saving the day.</p>

<p>Was it a coincidence that he showed up at both conferences early to help ensure their success? No coincidence at all. He's a person who shows up where the needs are, and he attends to those needs. That's who he is.</p>

<p>I do not know the details of the community-building work he does in Los Angeles, but I can tell you that Kenneth Wyrick is tops in my books. I admire the breadth of his knowledge and the depth of his sincerity. He is a builder -- a creator. It's impossible to build a national technology access movement without people like Kenneth Wyrick. And with people like Kenneth on board, anything becomes possible.</p>

</table>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu">College of Public and Community Service 
  (CPCS)</a> at <a href="http://www.umb.edu">UMass Boston</a> is in the process 
  of launching a series of community technology initiatives &#150; a new degree 
  program in <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">Community Media and Technology</a>, 
  the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">CTC VISTA Project</a>, and a number 
  of related projects, including sponsorship of The Community Technology Review. 
  Here's why and more about each.</p>
<p>It is by now axiomatic that most of our information about everything from people 
  and places to pressing social issues and the diversity of world cultures comes 
  to us through mass mediated words, sounds, and images. Particularly, as media 
  and information technologies converge, corporate power is being concentrated 
  in the hands of fewer and fewer transnational media and technology companies 
  which play an ever more crucial role in shaping everyday life for millions of 
  people. It is also the case that these very technologies hold out the promise 
  of incredible decentralization and democratization of communication.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a need to challenge the growing concentration of media 
  power and to develop the analytic tools to become critical consumers of existing 
  media fare. Just as importantly, there is a need to develop a community-based 
  telecommunications infrastructure and new democratic and participatory community 
  organizations and institutions that will empower people to become not just educated 
  consumers but skilled producers as well, equipped with the knowledge and tools 
  to tell their own stories, build their own communities and institutions, and 
  mobilize their own constituencies. There are now countless projects all over 
  the country where such goals are being realized. As these media and technologies 
  have become more affordable and more accessible, they have become useful, if 
  not indispensable, tools for even the smallest non-profits and community-based 
  organizations.</p>
<p>Given the increasing relevance of new media and information technologies to 
  public and community service, a major curriculum revision at CPCS has led to 
  the development of a new program in Community Media and Technology (CMT). While 
  we are progressing toward approval of a new major, we have put in place a CMT 
  concentration that can be used in conjunction with other degrees offered at 
  the college, as well as a free-standing certificate for students who already 
  have bachelor degrees. Both the concentration and certificate are designed to 
  provide students with the key competencies they need to appreciate the dangers 
  and the promises of media and technology for community building and incorporate 
  a range of multi-media tools into their primary responsibilities, be they labor 
  activists, community organizers, or agency professionals. Those wishing to explore 
  the curriculum and program in the context of the College's competency-based 
  approach to education are invited to explore its <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">online 
  resources</a>.</p>

<p>As a part of the effort to develop its capacities in the arena of Community 
  Media and Technology, CPCS has become the prime sponsor of the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">CTC 
  VISTA Project</a>  &#150; a collaboration with the Community Technology Centers' 
  Network (<a href="http://www.ctcnet.org">CTCNet</a>) and <a href="http://www.americorps.org">AmeriCorps*VISTA</a> &#150; providing 
  for the recruitment, placement, training, support, and administrative coordination 
  for AmeriCorps*VISTA members who work in community technology centers (CTCs) 
  in the greater Boston area and across the country. Participating VISTAs receive 
  ongoing mentoring at their home sites and attend a periodic training and orientation 
  institute at CPCS.</p>
<p>Over the last year, a consortium of partners from the CTC VISTA project has 
  come together to develop plans for expanding community media and technology 
  resources throughout the region through developing the Greater Boston Broadband 
  Network (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/gbbn.pdf">GBBN</a>). GBBN is 
  designed to provide an integrated combination of advanced information technology 
  and telecommunications services, including training, multi-media content production 
  and distribution, and access to broadband services that includes building upon 
  the university's high-speed telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
<p>The GBBN consortium developed a <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/top.proposal.html">proposal</a> 
  for the Department of Commerce's Technology Opportunity Program (<a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/top/index.html">TOP</a>), 
  with strong support from local units of government, hoping to give these efforts 
  a major boost. CPCS, the VISTA Project, and the Lowell community technology 
  consortium members are helping forge a <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/profdev.html">multi-campus-community 
  technology project</a>, too.</p>
<p>The CTC VISTA Project and the CPCS CMT program go hand in hand in developing 
  complementary university-community partnerships. The Community Technology Review 
  is part of this package of services and resources. We believe it provides an 
  excellent opportunity to gather information about important community practices 
  and to do so in a reflective, self-conscious way, thus combining the best of 
  both partners is such a collaboration. We look forward to your feedback and 
  involvement with our efforts.<br>

<p>What have community network practitioners learned to do well that can now be 
  taught to other practitioners? In antiquity, the walls and gates surrounding 
  a town or city did more than provide protection: they helped define the boundaries 
  of the culture and commerce that thrived within. In the age of the Internet, 
  these boundaries are electronic. The art of community networking is evolving 
  into a practice that uses the Internet creatively to help communities better 
  define themselves, as the city gates of old had done. &#147;Ars Portalis&#148; 
  literally translated means &#147;the arts of the city gates.&#148; <br>
<p>The idea for the <a href="http://www.arsportalis.org">Ars Portalis</a> project 
  began during an Association for Community Networking strategic planning retreat 
  held in July 1998. The Technology Opportunity Program of the U.S. Department 
  of Commerce (formerly TIIAP) had just announced a request for proposals to help 
  the agency better focus program guidelines and improve understanding of how 
  funded demonstration projects could thrive under their own steam. This issue 
  of &#147;sustainability&#148; was an important theme at the AFCN retreat and 
  remains so. Building on these discussions, the Center for Civic Networking successfully 
  negotiated a one-year $100,000 contract from TOP, awarded in June 2000, to ask 
  leading practitioners to compete in a cluster of small, short-term studies to 
  sharpen understanding of key sustainability issues facing community networks.

<p>As an initial activity, a planning meeting held in September 2000 assessed 
  the current &#147;state of play&#148; of community networking, producing a white

  Networking Gets Interesting</a>&#148; that can be downloaded from the Ars Portalis 
  website. A request for proposals was prepared, based on the white paper. Twenty-five 
  applications were received in November and reviewed by a panel of community 
  networking experts in December, with five contract studies awarded in January 
  2001 and completed in May. Towards the end of the studies, online requests for 
  comments were invited from community networking practitioners from around the 
  world to critique initial findings. 
<p>The five contracted studies tackled a range of practical challenges and opportunities 
  facing community networks.

    system incorporates a suite of modules that could be useful in a variety of 
    settings relevant to many community-based organizations such as CTCs and community 
    networks. These modules include: User profiles, web email, calendar, forums, 
    listserv, chat, file storage, news, org/business database, GIS maps, job/volunteer 
    postings, surveys, resumes, personal portals and site-wide search.</li>

    now need to be made to help open new markets for community networking.</li>

<p>Where does the Ars Portalis project lead? Community networking is a work in 
  progress. There is a great need to better formalize tacit knowledge embedded 
  in the field experience of practitioners into formal knowledge that can influence 
  both curriculum and funding priorities both public and private. The Ars Portalis 
  project promotes a continual cycle of improved practice by supporting the work 
  of practitioners in translating the lessons they learn in the field into practical 
  ways that can be used by others. </p>
<p> A final report compiling overall findings and recommendations and the online 
  critique will be completed during the summer of 2001. This report will contribute 
  to the transformation of ten years of demonstration projects into robust new 
  enterprises that help local communities better define themselves in the digital 
  age. The report will offer a detailed and rich assessment of key sustainability 
  issues facing community networking. This assessment hopes to create a foundation 
  for new curriculum development designed to improve practice, and suggest shifts 
  in funding priorities needed to open new markets for community networking.

<h3 class="title">The Atlanta Community Technology (ACT) Initiative</h3>

<p><i>&#147;Science and technology can sometimes be dazzling. Still human knowledge 
  has not made life secure and happy for most people.&#148;&#151;cyber center 
  client </i></p>
<table width="252" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" align="left">

      at the CTCNet conference in Atlanta last June.</font></i></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In December of 1999, the City of Atlanta embarked on an effort to redress the 
  digital divide. Mayor Bill Campbell charged Jabari Simama, Executive Director 
  of the Mayor&#146;s Office of Community Technology, with developing and implementing 
  a Community Technology Initiative for the municipality. The mission of the <a href="http://www.atlantacommunitytech.com">Atlanta 
  Community Technology (ACT) Initiative</a> is to &#147;ensure that technology 
  and new media improve the quality of life of Atlanta residents by providing 
  public access to training, equipment, information and knowledge.&#148; 
<p> Local business leaders, researchers from academic institutions, labor and 
  education specialists, and administrators of city agencies with relevant experience 
  in technology in low-income and under served communities of Atlanta were brought 
  together to form committees and development teams to assist in the planning 
  process. Drawing on the collective expertise of these diverse stakeholders, 
  the ACT Initiative developed a strategic plan and opened the first cyber center 
  in June, 2000, coinciding with the 9th annual conference of the <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org">Community 
  Technology Centers&#146; Network.</a> <br>
  <br>
  <br>
<h3> Program Synopsis</h3>
<p>
The community cyber centers are funded by $8.1 million generated from the city&#146;s 
Cable Franchise Agreement. Cable companies pay franchise fees to cities in exchange 
for using public spaces to lay their cables. The funding for the ACT Initiative 
was obtained in exchange for the city returning unused cable channels and foregoing 
a partially funded fiber optic municipal network that was part of the original 
Cable Franchise Agreement. The cyber centers have also received about $600,000 
in donations from private corporations. Partners run the gamut of public, private 
and non-profit organizations, such as SkillLearning.com, 3-Com, Earthlink, BellSouth, 
Gateway, the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library, Atlanta Public Schools and Hands-On-Atlanta. 
These partners provide hardware, software, Internet access, and training course. 
In addition, the city is seeking additional partnerships for future centers. 
<p> The ACT Initiative is ambitious, but as Microsoft CEO <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2000/10-18digitaldividends.asp">Bill 
  Gates stated</a>, &#147;just focusing on access to computers is a fairly narrow 
  way to look at these problems.&#148; This is perhaps the first and the largest 
  initiative funded by a major municipality. Some of the highlights: 
<ul>
  <li> Promotion and Community Education and Outreach</li>
  <li>Community Technology Centers</li>
  <li>&#147;One Stop Digital Shop&#148; Resource Center</li>
  <li>Basic Literacy and Computer Literacy Programming</li>
  <li>Job Skills Programming</li>
  <li>A Virtual City Hall</li>
  <li>A Virtual Community Portal</li>
  <li>Public-Private Partnerships</li>
  <li>Fundraising for Program Sustainability</li>
  <li>Challenge Grants for Best Practices</li>
</ul>
<p> The plan calls for 15 centers to become operational with an 18-month period. 
  <a href="#six">Six community centers</a> are open 
  as of May 2001 and each center houses 30-45 computers with Internet access. 
  The city will include at least one in south Atlanta with a bilingual emphasis 
  to give special help and encouragement to Spanish-speaking residents. Others 
  will include a special center for seniors, and another devoted to wireless communication 
  on the campus of Morris Brown College. 
<p>
At the cyber centers, any citizen can use the computers and take courses free 
of charge. To date, over 5000 residents have participated in the programs, one 
third of those are senior citizens. The centers offer two adult training courses: 
Introduction to Computers and Computer Applications, as well as After School and 
Summer Cyber Camp programs for teens. All courses are conducted in six weeks sessions. 
The cyber centers are staffed day and evening Monday through Friday with some 
centers providing hours on Saturday. <p>
The Virtual City Hall is currently under construction and will be brought online 
this fall and integrated with a Virtual Community Portal being funded by a $100,000 
grant from 3Com. The Virtual Community Portal will be a large Web site featuring 
content on the City of Atlanta, community and neighborhood services, neighborhood 
histories, homespun recipe books, and other forms of local content. Local residents 
enrolled in courses will help develop content for this Web site. 
<h3> Meeting Community Needs </h3>
<p> The <a href="http://www.atlantacommunitytech.com/strategic_plan_summary.htm">intent 
  of the program</a> is to establish cyber centers in city-owned and designated 
  facilities within approximately two miles of every resident who lives in a community 
  where the majority of households are likely to be without computer and Internet 
  access. In Atlanta, the inner city population has the greatest need for access. 
  These target communities are best represented by the Atlanta Empowerment Zone 
  and linkage neighborhoods. The Atlanta initiative faces the challenge of developing 
  and implementing programs to serve communities in which over 60% of the adult 
  population functions at the lowest literacy level Adults at Level 1 literacy 
  cannot usually locate an intersection on a street map, locate two pieces of 
  information in an article, complete a social security card application, or calculate 
  total costs of a purchase from an order form.
<p>
Therefore, developing computer-based literacy in this community is an even greater 
challenge. How are those less literate to deal with the overwhelming amount of 
materials on the Internet? How are they to master the research skills necessary 
to seek out information? Perhaps more importantly, how are they to create content 
that is pertinent to local needs and interests? Clearly the initiative needs to 
be prepared to offer both computer literacy and computer-based literacy programs. 
<p>
Given all the challenges detailed in a fuller examination, it is nonetheless fitting 
to conclude on a hopeful note with a client&#146;s perspective of the program.
<p> &quot;I cannot simply express the gratitude I have for Mayor Bill Campbell 
  and the City of Atlanta staff that are primarily responsible for giving me an 
  opportunity to obtain the computer skills that have now become almost necessary 
  to obtain many entry-level jobs in today&#146;s job market. I&#146;d like to 
  offer my support and prayers that this program will remain intact for our future 
  generations.&#148;

<h3 class="title">Bridging the Divide in Lowell, MA</h3>

<table width="202" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" align="left">
  <tr> 
    <td><a href="http://www.ltc.org"><img src="/summer-fall-2001/img/lctclogo.gif" width="201" height="63" alt="Lowell Telecom Corp logo" border="0"></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
The <a href="http://www.ltc.org">Lowell, MA Telecommunications Corporation (LTC)</a> 
prides itself on being the first center of its kind to open from the ground up 
as a combination traditional PEG (Public, Educational, and Government) access 
television station with a community technology center (CTC). Since 1994, LTC, 
committed to first-come, first-served telecommunication services to anyone in 
the community interested in expressing themselves and to providing training and 
access to the full range of media communication skills of the 21st century&#151;everything 
from video cameras to computers, from cable channels to the Internet, for community 
information and content production. 
<p> In the Summer of 1998, after four years of providing training and access to 
  thousands of residents and reaffirming its mission to &#147;Build Community 
  Through Technology&quot;&#151;rather than focus on the expansion and growth 
  of a central PEG access facility&#151;LTC chose to emphasize its role as a community 
  media and technology leader and public convener to decentralize its services 
  and work even more actively with the community. The <a href="http://www.lctc.org">Lowell 
  Community Technology Consortium</a> is the result of those efforts, a city wide 
  collaboration, consisting of 28 community-oriented organizations as of May 2001. 
<p> The Consortium came from a train-the-trainer class developed by LTC in the 
  summer of 1999, that in turn built on the spring organizing effort to develop 
  a proposal to the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OVAE/CTC/">U.S. Department 
  of Education Community Technology Centers</a> program.
<p> Despite not receiving the grant, formal meetings of the Consortium began in 
  October, 1999 (<a href="http://www.lctc.org/go/minutes/index.html">minutes of 
  recent meetings</a> can be found online). Initially holding small monthly meetings 
  concerned with needs assessment, mission statement forging, and setting up a 
  process for regular communication (monthly meetings, a listserv, and an underdeveloped 
  Web site), the group began to find its rhythm. It grew to eight, then to 10 
  and 12, and on to its <a href="http://www.lctc.org/go/minutes/index.html">present 
  membership</a>. 
<p> Meeting regularly with a defined mission helped spread the word. By March, 
  2000, the Consortium began to identify its core resource needs. Humans with 
  technical skill topped the list along with easier access to knowledge and technical 
  expertise. Faster and better equipment was not far behind. Along with Internet 
  connectivity issues, these have remained top concerns.
<p>&nbsp;
<table width="284" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" align="left">

  <tr>
    <td><i><font size="1">The University of Massachusetts broadband backbone and 
      its nodes in Lowell and Boston provide the infrastructural foundation for

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Being able to identify our resource needs in a systematic way made it very 
  easy for LTC to jump at additional partnership and grant opportunities. In the 
  spring of 2000, Peter Miller, a long time CTCNet activist and community organizer, 
  was beginning work on a pilot program grant to the Corporation for National 
  Service. Drawing together a number of CTCs in the Boston Metro region, this 
  Americorps VISTA program would involve human resource development, training 
  and support for CTCs. Understanding that human resources were a key need allowed 
  LTC to jump on this partnership grant opportunity. 
<p> About this same time, LTC received word from the U.S. Department of Education 
  CTC Program that its Consortium proposal would be one of 70 projects funded 
  in the 2000 grant round. The grant had been one of the top-rated projects not 
  funded in the previous year. With $826K spread over a three-year period matched 
  one-to-one by additional community resources, it was clear that the beginning 
  efforts of the Consortium were going to get a rocket boost. Having already begun 
  the work of consortium building, the infusion of the U.S. Department of Ed funds 
  in May, 2000, made it easy for LTC to act quickly in the mobilization of the 
  rogrammatic activities detailed in its grant application. The grant also formalized 
  the Consortium and its activities, brought even more CBOs to the table, and 
  infused the project with additional much needed human resources&#151;a project 
  coordinator, technology coordinator, and funding for CTC trainers and site managers.
<p>
During the first year of the grant, concluded on April 30, 2001, the Consortium 
has been able to:
<ul>
  <li> hire a full-time project director and a full-time community technology 
    coordinator;</li>
  <li>convene and support the technology activities of 28 NPOs engaged in technology 
    education and access;</li>
  <li>purchase equipment and support the creation of five and expansion of eight 
    CTCs;</li>
  <li>provide staffing support for tech coordinators;</li>
  <li>provide basic curricula and skill assessment for those beginning programs;</li>
  <li>work with other community initiatives such as technology planning for NPOs;</li>
  <li>create a foundation for a community database;</li>
  <li>use convening authority to build local support for national endeavors (i.e., 
    <a href="http://www.ctcnet.org">CTCNet</a> and <a href="http://www.americaconnects.net">America 
    Connects Consortium</a>); and</li>
  <li>bring speakers and funders to the table with a strong collaborative identity.</li>
</ul>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>The forming of the Consortium has also allowed us to draw in additional resources 
  from other sectors as well. For example: 
<ul>
  <li> LTC and the Consortium have been actively involved with the University 
    of Massachusetts/Boston's College of Public and Community Service (CPCS) and 
    the national CTC VISTA project, the partnership that has brought five <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/whatsnew.html">AmeriCorps 
    VISTA</a> members to Consortium member agencies. This partnership has led 
    to work on a <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/gbbn.pdf">collaborative 
    grant</a> to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Technology Opportunities Program 
    (TOP). Also a vital link with the Center for Family, Work and Community (CFWC) 
    and the Department of Regional Economic and Social Development (RESD) at the 
    University of Massachusetts/Lowell is leading to the development of accredited 
    training opportunities for those looking to work within community media and 
    technology environments. LTC and the Consortium are playing a crucial link 
    <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/profdev.html">between these two UMass 
    campuses</a>. The Consortium has also formed a partnership with the UMass-Lowell 
    Computer Science Department, which has provided training space, student labor, 
    and connections to additional resources. </li>
  <li>The Consortium was also able to present 13 of its member organizations involved 
    in youth-based technology centers to PowerUp as a powerful model of a local/regional 
    partner. Two Consortium member agencies (CFWC and Recruitment Resources Consulting) 
    will become PowerUp sites within the next six months, with additional sites 
    to take root in the next three years.</li>
  <li>The Consortium has been able to leverage additional funds from the Verizon 
    Foundation and the HUD funded Enterprise Community Grant program to support 
    human resource development and training. A partnership with the Cisco Foundation 
    is in the beginning stages and one Consortium member agency, the United Teen 
    Equality Center, has garnered both cash and equipment resources from them. 
  </li>
  <li>The YWCA was able to leverage its membership in the Consortium and its funds 
    through the Department of Ed grant into matching resources for a Department 
    of Justice Seed Tech grant that helped them expand their partnership to work 
    with the local Weed and Seed program.</li>
</ul>
<p> The collaboration is in the process of trying to codify what goes on in our 
  centers in terms of information, knowledge and training, to create models for 
  ourselves and others to learn and grow from.

<h3 class="title">Reflections upon the National Service Leadership Institute</h3>

<p>Coordinating a VISTA program comes with many challenges. And when the VISTAs are in community technology centers spread across hundreds of miles the challenges are multiplied. I learned various strategies for resolving the challenges and improving the OCCCN VISTA program at <A href="http://www.occcn.org">Ohio Community Computing Center Network</A>. NSLI encourages strong national service programs by developing the leadership skills of national service program coordinators. NSLI is an amazing (yet under promoted) resource within the <A href="http://www.cns.gov">Corporation for National Service</A>. The Corporation for National Service is the federal agency that oversees VISTA programs. 
<H3>OCCCN VISTA Program</H3>
<P>&nbsp; 
<TABLE align=left border=0 cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0 width=365>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><IMG height=448 src="/summer-fall-2001/img/leadershipservice.jpg" width=360></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>OCCCN is a statewide membership-based network of community technology centers (CTCs). OCCCN provides support to the CTCs in the form of program development, resource development, communication, and advocacy. 
<P>The OCCCN VISTA Program is one of the services OCCCN provides to the community technology centers of Ohio. OCCCN currently has 22 VISTAs in community technology centers across Ohio. OCCCN VISTAs strengthen and expand community technology centers or help develop new community technology centers. 
<H3>National Service Leadership Institute</H3>
<P>Staff members coordinating national service programs in organizations with VISTA, AmeriCorps, Learn &amp; Serve or Senior Corps grants are eligible to attend a <A href="http://www.nationalservice.org/resources/training/nsli">National Service Leadership Institute</A>. I attended an NSLI in January of 2001. By self-evaluating my skills and reflecting upon my past experiences, I can determine how my actions can improve the OCCCN VISTA program. 
<P>The most notable characteristics of NSLI, in comparison to other training programs, is the focus on the participant, the interactive nature of all the activities, the reliance upon the participant to reflect upon the issues discussed within the context of their work and personal lives, and the assumption that the participants bring valuable knowledge and insight to the training. A good example of this is that the training was led by &#8220;facilitators&#8221;, not &#8220;presenters&#8221;. The facilitators were adept at leading the group through an idea, rather than explaining it to us. 
<P>What Did I Learn? And More Importantly, How Is It Affecting the OCCCN VISTA Program? 
<H3>Balancing Management and Leadership</H3>
<P>&nbsp; 
<TABLE align=left border=0 cellPadding=0 cellSpacing=0 width=354>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><IMG align=left height=302 src="/summer-fall-2001/img/Vision.gif" width=350></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The National Service Leadership Institute I attended was a four-day training. Each day included an hour or two of discussions with a &#8220;Learning Group&#8221; led by one of the NSLI facilitators. The learning group provided an opportunity to discuss the activities and issues of the day. It also provided the participants with a comfortable place to reflect upon our own situations. Because of the geographic distance between me and the VISTAs (up to 200 miles) and the size of the OCCCN VISTA program, balancing leadership and management is an issue I struggle with everyday. Only two of the VISTAs are in the same city as I. Since the OCCCN VISTAs tend to only hear from me regarding administrative issues such as payroll, trainings and paperwork, I have had little chance to get to know them, encourage them and provide needed support. 
<P>One of the Learning Group activities was for a participant to describe a difficulty that she or he faced. Then the group brainstormed suggestions. Upon my request, my Learning Group offered many suggestions on how I can strengthen my relationship with the OCCCN VISTAs. Their suggestions included: inviting the VISTAs to a barbecue at my house, sending the VISTAs electronic cards, sending appreciation notes or e-mails, holding regional OCCCN VISTA meetings (reducing the travel needed to visit all the sites), asking the site supervisors to describe something positive the VISTA has done and then share it in a newsletter, asking the VISTAs to submit a challenge of the month which the other VISTAs could respond to electronically, and asking someone outside of our program to facilitate a team building for the VISTAs, Site Supervisors and me. 
<H3>Planning of Program Trainings</H3>
<P>NSLI discussed various methods of decision-making and the effects of each within specific situations. For the previous OCCCN VISTA training, the VISTA Leader and I planned the event. The next one will be planned (mostly) by the VISTAs. NSLI referred to this as &#8220;delegating with constraints". The VISTA Leader and I will decide what issues and logistics of the training are not negotiable. Other training decisions such as topics, format, location, and food will be up to the VISTAs. 
<P>I highly recommend coordinators of VISTA Programs apply to attend a training coordinated by NSLI. Not since graduate school had I encountered instructors that so greatly affected my work.

<h3 class="title">Looking Ahead: On the Community Telecommunication Policy Horizon</h3>

<table width="211" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" align="left">
  <tr> 
    <td><img src="/summer-fall-2001/img/RyanBW.gif" width="210" height="242"></td>

</table>
Since the last edition of the <a href="http://www.civicnet.org/comtechreview/omb_watch_nonprofits.htm">Community 
Technology Review</a>, there has been an exciting period of activity in which 
community technology access has emerged as a policy issue at the national, state, 
and local level. The increased national focus on community technology comes attendant 
with heated debates around the existence and true extent of &#147;digital divides&#148; 
and perceived solutions around the gaps and disparity of access to tools, training, 
knowledge, and opportunities to use technology for social, economic, and civic 
participation. 
<p>
Criticisms around digital divide elimination efforts are largely rooted in the 
belief that the problem, if it indeed exists, has been distorted out of proportion. 
We hear that the digital divide has wrongly been cast as one of race, age, gender, 
and income, when it is instead one around educational ability and literacy, or 
perceived need and relevance to the lives of citizens. We hear that since the 
private sector has already launched a number of new and existing initiatives and 
collaborations, addressing perceived gaps in technology access, government should 
not spend money on similar efforts. It is said that no one can force people to 
want technology access&#151;it must be desired, and therefore acquired, by individuals 
who truly want it. As such, the digital divide is solved by simply letting the 
producers of technology continue to make technology available, and letting people 
adopt it as they will.<p>
Critics, however, overlook one simple fact: the &#147;digital divide&#148; is 
about access to knowledge, education, opportunity, choice and control, so that 
underrepresented voices have presence and legitimacy in a society that is increasingly 
dependent on information and communications technology for every facet of social 
interaction and civic participation. The concepts embedded in digital divide policies 
will continue to play a major role in defining the policy goals and scope of community 
technology in all of its manifestations.<p>
The policy framework of the Clinton Administration outlined both strong support 
and clear objectives for addressing community technology and digital divide activity. 
The federal U.S. Department of Education&#146;s CTC program has grown from $10 
million in fiscal year (FY) 1998, to $32.5 million in FY 1999, and $65 million 
in FY 2000. The new political environment, however, presents community technology 
advocates with a complicated picture. Competing proposals from Congress and the 
White House would either phase out the current CTC program in favor of a new effort 
at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or expand the current 
effort under the Department of Education to the status of an authorized program. 
A large number of education technology funding opportunities face proposed consolidation 
into block grants, and even funding for basic information infrastructure projects 
under the popular Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) faces severe restrictions 
in the current policy environment.
<p> The Internet holds promise for enriching the lives and improving the circumstances 
  of all Americans, by offering access to useful, quality information that meets 
  individual and community needs&#151;but those needs must be articulated and 
  heeded. For all of the policy activity generated within Washington, DC, there 
  is still too little corresponding activity at the local level, and too few community 
  technology efforts are able to navigate the difficult application processes 
  for existing federal funding opportunities. In order to continue to build momentum 
  for community technology program funding, advocates need to direct their voices, 
  and promote their activities, to decision makers on a regular basis. Only then 
  can the constituency be seen, heard, and taken seriously politically.

<h3 class="title">Thoughts on Atlanta from Lowell, MA</h3>

<table width="114" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" align="left">
  <tr> 
    <td><img src="/summer-fall-2001/img/ltc.logo.jpg" width="91" height="74"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The Lowell Telecommunications Corporation (<a href="http://www.ltc.org">LTC</a>) 
  has watched the developments of community technology centers (CTC) in Atlanta 
  with great interest: first, because some of the players involved in Atlanta 
  have roots in the Public, Educational and Governmental (PEG) access movement; 
  second, because resources traditionally used by PEG access centers (channel 
  bandwidth and cable TV franchise fees) were used instead for CTCs; and third, 
  because the Atlanta Community Technology Initiative and Family Technology Resource 
  Centers hold the promise of being outstanding models of Bridging the Digital 
  Divide. </p>
<p>The LTC believes that PEG access centers are uniquely positioned within local 
  communities to provide the leadership and vision for expanding access to training 
  and technical resources in the context of Bridging the Digital Divide. PEG access 
  centers have historically provided the training and the tools for individual 
  self expression as well as socially relevant content to be produced by individuals 
  and organizations. PEG access goes further by distributing this content on local 
  cable TV channels. </p>
<p>This framework, of providing access to the means of production and distribution 
  of content, can easily be applied to computer-based resources which are just 
  now emerging in many of our communities. CTCs offer training in basic office 
  applications which often leads to desk top publishing and the production of 
  newsletters and flyers; basic Internet training begins with getting an email 
  account and often leads to participating in discussion groups; learning to surf 
  the web evolves into producing websites; downloading graphics, audio or video 
  clips compels many to begin producing multi-media. In short, we see many people 
  come to computer labs as content consumers but quickly learn that they can become 
  content producers. </p>
<p>On this basis, there is substantial potential for partnership among CTCs and 
  PEG centers. Studying the articles in this issue of Community Technology Review 
  reveals just how much we have to gain by collaborating. We can share the human, 
  technical and financial resources to sustain our efforts, including instructors, 
  curriculum, equipment and bandwidth. Rather than competing for franchise fees 
  and grant funding, we can work together to achieve common goals. The leadership 
  for such collaborative efforts is just now emerging in both CTC and PEG access 
  organizations, which holds great promise for building and sustaining a national 
  movement committed to building community through technology. </p>

<h3 class="title">From Access to Outcomes: A New Report from the Morino Institute</h3>

<p><img src="/summer-fall-2001/img/P.61.gif" width="180" height="175" align="left">&quot;<a href="http://www.morino.org/divides">From 
  Access To Outcomes: Raising The Aspirations For Technology Initiatives in Low-Income 
  Communities,</a>&quot; is a new Morino Institute Working Paper. The report, 
  which has been refined with the help of more than 50 top thought leaders in 
  the field, represents an ambitious effort to channel, redirect, and augment 
  the energies that are being devoted to closing the digital divide. The real 
  opportunity, the report concludes, is to go beyond the goal of expanding access 
  to technology and focus on applying technology to achieve tangible and meaningful 
  improvements in the standards of living of families that are now struggling 
  to rise from the bottom rungs of our economy. </p>
<p>The report argues that it is time to stop focusing so intensively on the technology 
  divide per se; the real divides we should seek to narrow are America's core 
  social divides &#151; the grave disparities in economic opportunity, education, 
  health, safety, housing, employment, and even transportation. Technology, if 
  applied correctly, can be a major help in narrowing these divides. Addressing 
  a social challenge of this size demands a fundamental shift in thought and action 
  -- in public policy, philanthropy, and corporate and nonprofit leadership. Anything 
  less than a massive mobilization of resources, financing, talent, and innovation 
  is destined to produce only incremental and isolated victories. Investments 
  in technology must go far beyond funding for hardware, software, and wires and 
  include significant additional funding to help people understand, apply, and 
  manage the technology.<br>

<h3 class="title">Strengthening The Public Sphere: Sharing the Patterns of Our Work</h3>

<p>Thinking about the future of the Internet is to invite schizophrenia:  technology as wide open, bubbling over with beneficial potential for education, political participation, economic opportunity, and social justice.  A darker view:  the Internet as another medium in the inexorable process of being colonized, homogenized, commercialized.
</p><p>
In either case, we are lead to ask:  What sort of information and communication systems do we need?  What policies can help us with this effort?  What campaigns do we launch?  Activists believe that building equitable and effective communication and information systems can help address issues of concern at the local level.  Tomorrow's citizens will need information and communication technology that Microsoft, AT&T, and Disney are unlikely to build.

<b>DIAC-00 -- Shaping the Network Society:  The Future of the Public Sphere in Cyberspace</b>
</p><p>
In May 2000, 400 people attended Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility's (<a href="http://www.cpsr.org">CPSR</a>) seventh "Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing" (DIAC) symposium.  The <a href="http://www.scn.org/cpsr/diac-00/free-procs.html">proceedings</a> contain theoretical essays as well as case studies from Italy, Nigeria, Argentina, and Canada's Northwest Territories.  Thanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation, we have 100 hard copy editions of the proceedings available <a href="http://www.scn.org/cpsr/diac-00/free-procs.html">for free for appropriate requests.</a>
</p><p>
In contrast to other concepts in communication studies (like "cultural imperialism" or "media monopoly"), the concept of "public sphere" is positive, an idealized communication venue into which all people can freely enter. It is through the conversations in this "public sphere" that civic decisions are made.  This is fundamental to democratic systems. The topic was discussed after the conference in <a href="http://www.cpsr.org/publications/newsletters/issues/2000/Summer2000/index.html">CPSR's Summer 2000 newsletter</a>.  "Public Sphere Correspondents" supply news dispatches from all over the world.
</p><p>
<b>Patterns for the New Millennium</b>
</p><p>
CPSR and the Public Sphere Project are launching the <a href="http://www.scn.org/cpsr/diac-02">DIAC-02 symposium</a>, planned for Seattle, May, 2002, to provide a forum to continue with these issues.  Dedicated to building bridges between practitioners and researchers, community organizers and policy-makers, DIAC-02 will focus on "patterns" as a common theme, where each pattern "describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of our solution to the problem." In our case we'll use patterns for the design and development of information and communication technology, policy, and use that are more human-centered and progressive.
</p><p>
All of us have are embarked on our own journeys to identify and refine the "patterns" that we use to think and work purposefully and effectively.  The work we undertake now can have a lasting influence; it can help determine whether the Internet becomes a powerful community and civic tool, or whether it degrades into another type of commercial television.  Stay tuned.

The University of Michigan <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu">School of Information</a> has been building capacity for the community technology movement for many years, through its <a href=" http://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msioverview.htm">master's degree program</a> project work, and collecting and publishing useful information resources.  In the past two years, these efforts have coalesced institutionally with the formation of a <a href=" http://www.si.umich.edu/cic">Community Information Corps</a> for current students and a Fellows program to support the professional development of graduates who do public interest work.  The <a href=" http://www.communitytechnology.org">Alliance for Community Technology</a> , a joint venture of the School and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, provides an umbrella for these and other activities at the intersection of academia, community serving organizations, and social investors.
</p><p>
The <a href=" http://www.si.umich.edu/cic/fellows-program.htm">Community Information Fellows program</a> is designed to encourage talented graduates to pursue public interest work, and to enhance their effectiveness in it.  Each Fellow receives professional development assistance in the form of mentoring and travel money, and a $5000 per year stipend for five years, so long as they pursue community and public interest work.  <a href="#fellowships">Six Fellowships</a> have been awarded, one last year and five this year.  First fellowship jobs range from support for regional workforce development to work with young adults in the Queens Public Library to producing a print and on-line newsletter from Nicaragua.  Funding for this year's Fellows came from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.  Funding for last year's Fellow came from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation through its support of the Alliance for Community Technology.  Over the next couple of years, we will be exploring the possibility of expanding the Fellows program to include master's degree students at other universities.

We would like to enlist the support of the broader technology movement in recruiting students and placing our graduates.  On the recruitment side, if you know college graduates who would like to build their capacity to contribute to the community technology movement, please urge them to consider the University of Michigan School of Information.  We especially encourage applications from former Americorps, Vista, and Peace Corps volunteers.  On the placement side, if you have a position that would be appropriate for someone with master's degree level skills (e.g., directing a community technology center, developing and evaluating programs, managing information collections, etc.) please post it through our <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/careers">careers web site</a>.  Summer internship postings as well as full-time positions are welcome.  There are <a href="#internships">nine internships</a> this summer.
</p><p>
While students are enrolled here, they can participate in our Community Information Corps.  At a weekly seminar, students present status reports about projects they are engaged in, meet visiting professionals in order to connect with national and international movements, and read and discuss works of political and social theory, to provide a larger context for understanding their work.  From a <a href="#projects">full list</a>, perhaps the most well-known that students and faculty have worked on over the past few years is the <a href=" http://databases.si.umich.edu/cfdocs/community/index.cfm">Community Connector</a> website, a national resource of information about community networks and community information systems.  As an outgrowth of this project, we are now developing infrastructure to support Knowledge Work Sites for particular sub-communities within the community technology movement.

<b><a name="projects">Full list of projects</a></b>
</p><p>
<a href="http://databases.si.umich.edu/cfdocs/community/index.cfm"> The Community Connector website</a> is a national resource of information about community networks and community information systems (Prof. Durrance).  As an outgrowth of this project, we are now developing infrastructure to support Knowledge Work Sites for particular sub-communities within the community technology movement (Profs. Atkins and Resnick).
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/">CHICO </a>, an ongoing project that captures cultural heritage materials and make them accessible to broader audiences.  Materials have ranged from a web-based history of underground railroad activity near Ann Arbor to a CD-ROM on the Yup'ik masks of the native people of southwestern Alaska and the Yukon (Profs. Frost and Holland).  
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.whothat.org">Who That</a>, tools and techniques for creating membership directories for neighborhoods, sports teams, and other groups, and research the effects these directories have on social capital in these groups (Prof.  Resnick).
</p><p>
In the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/kelloggcio">CIO Project</a>, SI students helped teenagers learn technology skills and use them in organizing community information, at the Flint Public Library and a community technology center in a public housing development (Profs. Durrance and Resnick).
</p><p>
On <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/features/hedstrom-s-africa.htm">South Africa trips</a>, students and faculty spent six weeks at the University of Fort Hare working on projects ranging from the archives of the ANC to e-commerce capabilities for local micro-enterprises (Profs. Hedstrom, Wallace, and Cogburn).
</p><p>
<a href="http://communitytechnology.org/asp-oss">ASPs and Open Source Software for non-profits</a> -- for several years, students provided information systems consulting to small non-profit organizations and explored some of the larger issues of how best to provide such services.  One outcome was a workshop and white paper on Application Service Providers and Open Source Software for the non-profit sector (Prof.  Cohen).
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.bettertogether.org">BetterTogether </a> grew out of <a href="http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/saguaro">the Saguaro Seminar on Civic Engagement</a>.  Visitors can download that group's report, read and contribute stories about new ways that Americans are connecting (Prof.  Resnick).
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.communitytechnology.org/aihec_vl/index.html">AIHEC Virtual Library initiative</a> is helping Native American Tribal Colleges to develop virtual digital libraries (Prof. Atkins).
</p><p>
The <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/libhelp">"How Libraries and Librarians Help" Project</a> examined how public libraries are providing community information.  A second part is developing tools that libraries can use to evaluate their activities (Prof. Durrance).
</p><p>
Through <a href="http://www.freshonline.net/">Fresh Online</a>, students developed prototype software for on-line grocery ordering in poor neighborhoods (Profs. Whatley and Resnick).
