<p>What have community network practitioners learned to do well that can now be 
  taught to other practitioners? In antiquity, the walls and gates surrounding 
  a town or city did more than provide protection: they helped define the boundaries 
  of the culture and commerce that thrived within. In the age of the Internet, 
  these boundaries are electronic. The art of community networking is evolving 
  into a practice that uses the Internet creatively to help communities better 
  define themselves, as the city gates of old had done. &#147;Ars Portalis&#148; 
  literally translated means &#147;the arts of the city gates.&#148; <br>
<p>The idea for the <a href="http://www.arsportalis.org">Ars Portalis</a> project 
  began during an Association for Community Networking strategic planning retreat 
  held in July 1998. The Technology Opportunity Program of the U.S. Department 
  of Commerce (formerly TIIAP) had just announced a request for proposals to help 
  the agency better focus program guidelines and improve understanding of how 
  funded demonstration projects could thrive under their own steam. This issue 
  of &#147;sustainability&#148; was an important theme at the AFCN retreat and 
  remains so. Building on these discussions, the Center for Civic Networking successfully 
  negotiated a one-year $100,000 contract from TOP, awarded in June 2000, to ask 
  leading practitioners to compete in a cluster of small, short-term studies to 
  sharpen understanding of key sustainability issues facing community networks.

<p>As an initial activity, a planning meeting held in September 2000 assessed 
  the current &#147;state of play&#148; of community networking, producing a white 
  paper entitled &#147;<a href="http://www.arsportalis.org/cnet_white.htm">Community 
  Networking Gets Interesting</a>&#148; that can be downloaded from the Ars Portalis 
  website. A request for proposals was prepared, based on the white paper. Twenty-five 
  applications were received in November and reviewed by a panel of community 
  networking experts in December, with five contract studies awarded in January 
  2001 and completed in May. Towards the end of the studies, online requests for 
  comments were invited from community networking practitioners from around the 
  world to critique initial findings. 
<p>The five contracted studies tackled a range of practical challenges and opportunities 
  facing community networks. 
<ul>
  <li> MIT PhD candidate Randal Pinkett analyzed data from interviews with residents 
    of a recently constructed&#151;and resident owned&#151;public housing development 
    in Boston, on their use of a prototype community networking software application 
    called the &#147;Creating Community Connections (C3)&#148; system. The C3 
    system incorporates a suite of modules that could be useful in a variety of 
    settings relevant to many community-based organizations such as CTCs and community 
    networks. These modules include: User profiles, web email, calendar, forums, 
    listserv, chat, file storage, news, org/business database, GIS maps, job/volunteer 
    postings, surveys, resumes, personal portals and site-wide search.</li>

    Dr. Avrum Bluming, founder of the Los Angeles Freenet, tested a potential 
    community network &#147;killer application&#148; for health care that empowers 
    patients and reduces demands on nurses, which can be replicated world-wide. 
  </li>
  <li> Matthew Shapiro, of a Boise Idaho based community development firm and 
    one time mayoral candidate (with over 30% of the votes), explored prospects 
    for municipal contract support of community network services to neighborhood 
    associations. </li>
  <li> Tom Campbell, executive director of SnoNet, a community network near Seattle, 
    examined 12 business opportunities with a prospect of generating close to 
    a half million a year in annual operating revenue. The business case analysis 
    was critiqued by venture capitalists, attorneys, accountants, and others in 
    the field of community networking to validate directions and risks for future 
    development. </li>
  <li> Finally, San Diego community media consultant Susan Myrland researched 
    federal policy supporting public telecommunications and interviewed a number 
    of community networking practitioners to uncover critical gaps that community 
    networks need to address to understand audience demographics and marketing&#151;and 
    where key federal investments based on public broadcasting precedent perhaps 
    now need to be made to help open new markets for community networking.</li>

<p>Where does the Ars Portalis project lead? Community networking is a work in 
  progress. There is a great need to better formalize tacit knowledge embedded 
  in the field experience of practitioners into formal knowledge that can influence 
  both curriculum and funding priorities both public and private. The Ars Portalis 
  project promotes a continual cycle of improved practice by supporting the work 
  of practitioners in translating the lessons they learn in the field into practical 
  ways that can be used by others. </p>
<p> A final report compiling overall findings and recommendations and the online 
  critique will be completed during the summer of 2001. This report will contribute 
  to the transformation of ten years of demonstration projects into robust new 
  enterprises that help local communities better define themselves in the digital 
  age. The report will offer a detailed and rich assessment of key sustainability 
  issues facing community networking. This assessment hopes to create a foundation 
  for new curriculum development designed to improve practice, and suggest shifts 
  in funding priorities needed to open new markets for community networking.
