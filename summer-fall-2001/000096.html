<div class="category_title">The Debate Over HR 1542 - The Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act: Will the Bells Steal America's Digital Future?</div> <span class="posted">by Audrie Krause</span>




<p><i>There's been much discussion about HR 1542, the Tauzin-Dingell bill. Whatever 
  its fate, the following piece by Audrie Krause and the response by Al Hammond 
  and APT reflect basic differences about telco policy well into the future. For 
  more on the bill see the <a href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/legis/legis.htm#hr1542">CyberTelecom 
  News</a>, the <a href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/legis/legis.htm">Washington 
  Internet Project's legislation page</a>, the two opposing articles in <a href="http://www.isp-planet.com/perspectives/separation.html">ISP 
  Planet</a>, and the Association for Community Networking <a href="http://www.afcn.net/docs/listserv_1542.html">exchanges</a>.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>In June 2000, NetAction released a <a href="http://www.netaction.org/broadband/bells">comprehensive 
  report</a> describing how the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) broke 
  the promises they made to regulators in the 1990s to deploy high-speed fiber 
  optic networks. If the Bells had kept those promises, almost half of the nation's 
  households and the vast majority of our schools would already be capable of 
  delivering high-speed Internet access. Instead, only about 500,000 households 
  have access to the Internet over fiber. NetAction sees this as a contributing 
  factor to the digital divide because those fiber optic networks would have been 
  widely deployed by now in low-income urban neighborhoods and rural communities, 
  as well as in schools, libraries and health care facilities. 
<p>
The Bells' promised to deploy fiber optic networks in exchange for relief 
from important pro-consumer regulations. In states where regulators went along 
with this tradeoff, traditional rate-of-return regulation intended to protect 
consumers from profit gouging was replaced with incentive or price cap regulation. 
The change gave the Bells more profits, but few of these high-speed networks were 
ever completed. 
<p> This history of failed promises should be a warning to Congress to reject 
  H.R. 1542, a bill which would allow Bell entry into long distance data markets 
  without regard to the state of competition in local phone service. Co-authored 
  by Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA) and John Dingell (D-MI), it was narrowly approved 
  by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 9. (For the bill's current 
  status, see <a href="http://www.netaction.org/briefings">NetAction's Broadband 
  Briefings</a> newsletter). 
<p>
Its supporters claim H.R. 1542 will help bridge the "digital divide" 
by expanding broadband deployment. But what it really does is remove a key consumer 
protection that Congress included in the 1996 Act: the requirement that local 
markets be open to competition before the Bells are allowed into long distance 
markets in their territories. <p>
H.R. 1542 also poses a threat to competitive DSL providers, which means it will 
have an impact on efforts to bridge the "digital divide" and expand 
access to broadband technology. Demand for all types of high-speed access is expected 
to skyrocket over the next few years. But full deployment of cable broadband won't 
be possible for several more years because of the need for network upgrades, and 
high-speed wireless and satellite service will also take some time to develop. 
That makes DSL an increasingly popular choice for consumers who want high-speed 
Internet access. But DSL won't remain affordable if the Bells monopolize 
the market, and that's a real possibility if H.R. 1542 becomes law.<p>
Competition is crucial to keeping broadband Internet access affordable and accessible, 
but competitive DSL providers are in a tough position. These mostly small companies 
compete head-to-head with the Bells in offering high-speed service to consumers. 
But the Bells own the networks these companies must buy the service from in order 
to sell it to consumers. Since the Bells are selling to their competitors, they 
have absolutely no incentive to sell wholesale DSL service at an affordable price. 
The incentive that Congress included in The Telecommunications Act of 1996 linking 
entry into long distance markets to the requirement that local markets be competitive 
would vanish if H.R. 1542 were enacted.
<p> If the Bells had kept their promises in the 1990s, the nation might have been 
  fully wired with fiber optic networks by now. If the Bells had met the conditions 
  spelled out in the 14-point checklist, the nation might already have vigorous 
  competition in both DSL and local phone service. But the Bells chose instead 
  to stonewall competition by engaging in protracted legal and regulatory maneuvers, 
  and by lobbying Congress to change the law. If the Tauzin-Dingell bill is enacted, 
  DSL will go the way of fiber optics. And the Bells will once again have stolen 
  America's digital future.
