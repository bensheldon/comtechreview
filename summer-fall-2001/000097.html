<div class="category_title">The Debate Over HR 1542 - The Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act: Response from the Alliance for Public Technology</div> <span class="posted">by Allen Hammond</span>




<p><i>There's been much discussion about HR 1542, the Tauzin-Dingell bill. Whatever 
  its fate, the following piece by Audrie Krause and the response by Al Hammond 
  and APT reflect basic differences about telco policy well into the future. For 
  more on the bill see the <a href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/legis/legis.htm#hr1542">CyberTelecom 
  News</a>, the <a href="http://www.cybertelecom.org/legis/legis.htm">Washington 
  Internet Project's legislation page</a>, the two opposing articles in <a href="http://www.isp-planet.com/perspectives/separation.html">ISP 
  Planet</a>, and the Association for Community Networking <a href="http://www.afcn.net/docs/listserv_1542.html">exchanges</a>.</i> 
</p>
<hr>
<p>NetAction has suggested that the Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment 
  Act of 2001 (H.R. 1542) threatens broadband Internet access because it (a) removes 
  the incentive for incumbent local phone companies (ILECs) to open their markets 
  to competition before entry into long distance; and (b) will put ILECs in a 
  position to monopolize broadband and dial-up services. Further NetAction argues 
  that the bill will not ensure broadband service availability to rural areas 
  while simultaneously expanding the digital divide. Finally, NetAction argues 
  that the ILECs are not deserving beneficiaries of the bill's largesse because 
  the ILECs didn't keep their prior promises to deploy fiber optic services in 
  exchange for removal of rate of return regulation. </p>
<p>
The Alliance for Public Technology (APT) applauds NetAction's decision to raise 
the public consciousness on these issues. However, APT would like to emphasize 
a somewhat different and ultimately, we believe, more fundamental point about 
the debate over H.R. 1542. The issue is not H.R. 1542 or any other legislative 
vehicle for accelerating ILEC entry into long distance, but: 
<ul>
  <li> Timely development and equitable deployment of technology neutral, accessible 
    broadband communications infrastructure and services to all Americans at affordable 
    rates; and</li>
  <li>Equitable implementation and enforcement of regulations governing like competitors 
    competing in the same market.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Too much of the current debate mirrors arguments put forth by corporations seeking 
to protect or expand market share in the converging marketplace for telecommunications 
and data services. While APT is not unsympathetic to the understandable concerns 
of the companies and their stockholders, APT believes that the public's interest 
in available, accessible, affordable broadband communications must remain the 
paramount concern. This means that those competing in the market must invest in 
the deployment of infrastructure and the provision of service to all communities 
regardless of socioeconomic status, race, class or geography. Only in this way 
can we assure that no American is left behind. But to do so, we must assure that 
all who invest and compete, fairly contribute to the efforts to deploy and provide.<p>
APT is convinced that an unwavering and uncritical insistence on unbundled access 
to newly minted broadband data infrastructure and services is as problematic for 
telephone as it is for cable and wireless competitors. It provides a significant 
disincentive for investment because the return on investment is severely undermined. 
This in turn facilitates a tendency to &#147;game&#148; the regulatory system 
at the expense of the public interest because the firms' interests and the public's 
interests are at odds. If the regulatory environment is fair to all competitors, 
and all contribute in an equitable manner that assures fair rather than favored 
competition, then the public and the companies' interests become one and the same. 
In the final analysis, it does not matter whether it is a national or local cable, 
telephone or wireless firm seeking to keep its networks closed by refusing to 
be interoperable, interconnected and open to all. To the extent that there are 
unserved areas, dead end or &#147;protected&#148; networks, competition cannot 
flourish and Americans as citizens, learners, patients, businesses and consumers 
will suffer. To the extent the regulatory system ostensibly operated in the name 
of the people, facilitates this result, it is unfair and ill advised.
<p> On the other hand, any effort to remove regulation must be more than just 
  &#147;even handed.&#148; It must also assure the timely development and equitable 
  deployment of technology neutral, accessible broadband communications infrastructure 
  and services to all Americans at affordable rates. This means the development 
  of reasonable guidelines and timetables for deployment to avoid electronic redlining; 
  an ongoing equitable means of financing timely equitable deployment of infrastructure; 
  provision of services at affordable prices; and a fundamental acknowledgment 
  that our evolving broadband infrastructure is a national resource that must 
  be available to all.
