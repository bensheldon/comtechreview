<p>The <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu">College of Public and Community Service 
  (CPCS)</a> at <a href="http://www.umb.edu">UMass Boston</a> is in the process 
  of launching a series of community technology initiatives &#150; a new degree 
  program in <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">Community Media and Technology</a>, 
  the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">CTC VISTA Project</a>, and a number 
  of related projects, including sponsorship of The Community Technology Review. 
  Here's why and more about each.</p>
<p>It is by now axiomatic that most of our information about everything from people 
  and places to pressing social issues and the diversity of world cultures comes 
  to us through mass mediated words, sounds, and images. Particularly, as media 
  and information technologies converge, corporate power is being concentrated 
  in the hands of fewer and fewer transnational media and technology companies 
  which play an ever more crucial role in shaping everyday life for millions of 
  people. It is also the case that these very technologies hold out the promise 
  of incredible decentralization and democratization of communication.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a need to challenge the growing concentration of media 
  power and to develop the analytic tools to become critical consumers of existing 
  media fare. Just as importantly, there is a need to develop a community-based 
  telecommunications infrastructure and new democratic and participatory community 
  organizations and institutions that will empower people to become not just educated 
  consumers but skilled producers as well, equipped with the knowledge and tools 
  to tell their own stories, build their own communities and institutions, and 
  mobilize their own constituencies. There are now countless projects all over 
  the country where such goals are being realized. As these media and technologies 
  have become more affordable and more accessible, they have become useful, if 
  not indispensable, tools for even the smallest non-profits and community-based 
  organizations.</p>
<p>Given the increasing relevance of new media and information technologies to 
  public and community service, a major curriculum revision at CPCS has led to 
  the development of a new program in Community Media and Technology (CMT). While 
  we are progressing toward approval of a new major, we have put in place a CMT 
  concentration that can be used in conjunction with other degrees offered at 
  the college, as well as a free-standing certificate for students who already 
  have bachelor degrees. Both the concentration and certificate are designed to 
  provide students with the key competencies they need to appreciate the dangers 
  and the promises of media and technology for community building and incorporate 
  a range of multi-media tools into their primary responsibilities, be they labor 
  activists, community organizers, or agency professionals. Those wishing to explore 
  the curriculum and program in the context of the College's competency-based 
  approach to education are invited to explore its <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/cmt">online 
  resources</a>.</p>

<p>As a part of the effort to develop its capacities in the arena of Community 
  Media and Technology, CPCS has become the prime sponsor of the <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista">CTC 
  VISTA Project</a>  &#150; a collaboration with the Community Technology Centers' 
  Network (<a href="http://www.ctcnet.org">CTCNet</a>) and <a href="http://www.americorps.org">AmeriCorps*VISTA</a> &#150; providing 
  for the recruitment, placement, training, support, and administrative coordination 
  for AmeriCorps*VISTA members who work in community technology centers (CTCs) 
  in the greater Boston area and across the country. Participating VISTAs receive 
  ongoing mentoring at their home sites and attend a periodic training and orientation 
  institute at CPCS.</p>
<p>Over the last year, a consortium of partners from the CTC VISTA project has 
  come together to develop plans for expanding community media and technology 
  resources throughout the region through developing the Greater Boston Broadband 
  Network (<a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/gbbn.pdf">GBBN</a>). GBBN is 
  designed to provide an integrated combination of advanced information technology 
  and telecommunications services, including training, multi-media content production 
  and distribution, and access to broadband services that includes building upon 
  the university's high-speed telecommunications infrastructure.</p>
<p>The GBBN consortium developed a <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/top.proposal.html">proposal</a> 
  for the Department of Commerce's Technology Opportunity Program (<a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/top/index.html">TOP</a>), 
  with strong support from local units of government, hoping to give these efforts 
  a major boost. CPCS, the VISTA Project, and the Lowell community technology 
  consortium members are helping forge a <a href="http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/vista/profdev.html">multi-campus-community 
  technology project</a>, too.</p>
<p>The CTC VISTA Project and the CPCS CMT program go hand in hand in developing 
  complementary university-community partnerships. The Community Technology Review 
  is part of this package of services and resources. We believe it provides an 
  excellent opportunity to gather information about important community practices 
  and to do so in a reflective, self-conscious way, thus combining the best of 
  both partners is such a collaboration. We look forward to your feedback and 
  involvement with our efforts.<br>
